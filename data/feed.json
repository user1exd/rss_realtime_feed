        "description": "From the origin of the traditional jewellery style to the things to keep in mind while investing in a jadau piece, Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy, reveals it all",
        "content": "a hallmark of India's rich cultural heritage, is experiencing a resurgence in the contemporary fashion landscape. Known for its intricate Jadau involves embedding precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds into softened gold, creating exquisite pieces that exude opulence and tradition. This resurgence can be traced back to Bollywood’s influence, particularly through films like where Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s regal adornments captivated audiences, reigniting interest in traditional . Bachchan's wedding further cemented Jadau’s status as a timeless bridal choice, inspiring many to embrace its grandeur. Renowned filmmaker has significantly contributed to this revival. His collaborations with Shri Paramani Jewels for movies like and now the web series have showcased the beauty of Jadau on an epic scale, with meticulously crafted pieces that highlight the intricate artistry involved. Actor Aditi Rao Hydari, playing the role of courtesan Bibbojaan, epitomises the still-existing opulence of the British Raj era. During the movie promotions, Rao Hydari was seen in a multi-coloured floral anarkali paired with meticulously crafted Jadau earrings by designer Neety Singh. The art of jadau is not just a relic of the past but a vibrant part of Influencers and brides alike are blending these traditional pieces with contemporary styles, creating a fusion that celebrates both heritage and innovation. As Jadau jewellery continues to grace red carpets and , its enduring elegance promises to captivate generations to come. The prized craft of holds a special place in our ethnic wardrobes. An uncut diamond piece is considered a prized possession in any Indian , and is often lovingly passed down through generations as an heirloom. New Delhi-based Hazoorilal Legacy, one of the oldest jewellery houses in the country today, is known for experimenting with traditional jadau designs to serve the modern connoisseur. spoke to Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy to get a microscopic view at all that goes into the making of this craft. Excerpts below. Jadau work was introduced in India by the Mughals, but practiced and perfected by the skilled craftsman of , which to date is considered as the hub of jadau jewellery. It is essentially a technique of jewellery-making wherein precious gemstones such as uncut diamonds, pearls, and rubies are embedded into gold. Gold is actually turned into a frame on which precious stones are studded without the use of any adhesive. Jadau derives its name from the colloquial term ‘jad’ (which means to embed), and is commonly used in , and meenakari jewellery. The design of the jewellery is made by [a group of artisans called the] Chiterias, followed by engraving and spacing using pliable gold, which is done by Ghaarias. Once the stones are naturally set in the gold casing, the enameller decorates the back of the jewellery in meenakari work. The time to produce jadau varies, depending upon the piece that is being . It’s a tedious process requiring utmost care and finesse. So while a smaller piece can be finished in a couple of days, an elaborate piece can actually take up to a few months to be ready. It’s one of the of and has an interesting history behind it. The Mughals introduced it to India, but this workmanship was perfected and made native by the artisans of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It requires a skilled and unique craftsmanship, which of course, makes it very compelling. The traditional form of jewellery is made without any interference of technology, which increases the man hours [it takes to create it], and makes it extremely valuable. It’s pure hand work. If you ask me, it is surely a reminder of the rich cultural heritage of our country. Before investing in a , one should always check the purity of the gold being used. The jadau workmanship is usually done in 22-24k gold. The casing in which the stones are embedded should not be less than 22k gold. Another important point is to check if the stones are treated or natural. One should also be aware of the various treatments that are used to enhance the look of uncut diamonds and other precious and semi-precious in jadau jewellery. It’s very delicate and needs to be handled with utmost care. The should be kept neatly wrapped in padded cloth box or an airtight container to minimise any kind of exposure to moisture and other pollutants. This helps to protect the look and feel of the jewellery. It should be the last thing you should wear when you’re getting ready, as perfumes and hairsprays can corrode the , and it should also be the very first thing you take off.",

        "content": "Ahead of 29th May, Governor Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State has commissioned a modern Quranic School in the company of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III in the Gummi local government area. Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, Governor Dauda, said the establishment of the school is part of the campaign promises aimed at promoting combined Islamic Religious Knowledge and Western education. Other projects visited by Governor Lawal were the newly constructed hospital in Nasarawa Burkullu under the Bukkuyum local government area and the other renovated hospital in the Maru local government area of the state. The Governor while delivering his speech at Gummi, emphasized the need to educate the growing children in the modern Quranic Schools in the state with a view to prepare them with peace-loving and brother-keeper attitudes. He further cried that the alarming rate of insecurity bedevilled the state and the entire nation was the handiwork of evil who always accommodates illiteracy as his sole tool to derail society into crimes and cruelties. “Zamfara has been one of the states that slipped into the target of banditry and other heinous crimes therefore, desperately needs to be educated to avoid producing crime-living generations instead”, Governor Lawal has stressed. In his remarks shortly after cutting the tape, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III, positioned that, the commissioned school is unique as it would not graduate students who will later become street beggars. “This type of Quranic school would teach, train and discipline its students to become lucrative products in the society as it doubles as a ground to inculcate patriotism and both ethnic and religious tolerance”, the Sultan has added.",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Scott Alan Johnston, Universe Today Four zebrafish are alive and well after nearly a month in space aboard China's Tiangong space station. As part of an experiment testing the development of vertebrates in microgravity, the fish live and swim within a small habitat aboard the station. While the zebrafish have thus far survived, they are showing some signs of disorientation. The taikonauts aboard Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on their spatial awareness. The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of these species. As a test subject, zebrafish have several advantages. Their short reproductive and development cycle, and transparent eggs, allow scientists to study their growth quickly and effectively, and their genetic makeup shares similarities with humans, potentially offering insights that are relevant to human health . The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates across species while exposed to microgravity. The taikonauts aboard Tiangong perform feeding and water sampling at regular intervals , and cameras allow scientists on the ground to monitor the aquarium. This is not the first time fish have been to space. Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines. Earlier fish in space include a mummichog aboard Skylab 3 in 1973 (and again in 1975 aboard Apollo-Soyuz), and zebrafish aboard the Soviet space station Salyut 5 in 1976. A variety of fish reached orbit aboard space shuttles in the 1990s, too. The health and sustainability of animal life in space is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this pressing area of research. Provided by Universe Today",

Thank you for your service, sacrifice and selflessness!#MemorialDay2024 (Artist unknown)' Bette Midler shared, 'Today is #MemorialDay in the US, so read #FlandersFields, but spare a thought for the millions who died from the senseless hate humans have rained down on each other in the last 100 years since then, and the one million #Americans who perished during Covid just a few years ago.' Memorial Day tends to mark the unofficial start of summer for many Americans, though the season really begins with the Summer Solstice in mid-June. The annual holiday - which is celebrated on the last Monday of May - is a federal holiday in the United States for mourning the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. Since the Revolutionary War ended, 646,596 American troops have died in battle and more than 539,000 died from other, non-combat related causes. It was formerly observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970. Flag etiquette on Memorial Day is unique, according to the Farmers Almanac . At sunrise, flags are to be raised to full staff briskly, then lowered to half staff position, where they will remain until noon. See guidelines for flying the American Flag. Traditionally, on Memorial Day (U.S.), volunteers often place small American flags on each grave site at national cemeteries. A national moment of remembrance takes place at 3:00 p.m. local time. Consider visiting a local cemetery to place flags; many organizations would be grateful for volunteers. Contact your local American Legion post, Daughters of the American Revolution, or Boy or Girl Scouts troops. The custom of honoring ancestors by cleaning cemeteries and decorating graves is an ancient and worldwide tradition. In early rural America, it was usually performed in summer and was an occasion for family reunions and picnics. The ritual of visiting family graves and memorials was never a morbid tradition. Rather, it was an annual act of remembrance, as well as a chance to clean and decorate family memorials. Often, families would picnic as well; cemeteries were often the only open green spaces in crowded cities. Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, starting with the American Civil War. It's believed that the tradition of honoring the dead was inspired by the way Southern states decorated the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers with flowers, wreaths, and flags.

On May 5, 1866, Waterloo, New York, hosted its own community-wide event that, in 1966, led to President Lyndon Johnson declaring the town as the birthplace of Decoration Day. Meanwhile, on May 5, 1868, inspired by the suggestion of veteran, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (a fraternal organization of Union Civil War veterans), issued General Order No. 11, designating the 30th of May as an annual day of remembrance. The idea caught on. U.S. President Joe Biden honored fallen soldiers during the 156th observance of Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery outside the nation's capital on Monday. Biden placed a wreath of flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a solemn ceremony, where he was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater. Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action. US President Joe Biden speaks at the 156th National Memorial Day observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, May 27, 2024 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action The Memorial Day ceremony is the latest in a string of events where Biden has focused on active and retired military personnel, including delivering the commencement speech on Saturday at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York . Next week, the president will travel to Normandy, France, to participate in ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . He is expected to give a major speech about the heroism of Allied forces in World War Two and the continuing threats to democracy today. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Biden's son Beau, who served in Iraq as part of Delaware's National Guard. Beau died from glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that his father believes was possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits in Iraq. 'This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,' Biden said. 'Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim. 'The pain of his loss is with me every day ... so is the pride in his service,' the president said. On Memorial Day, each grave site at Arlington will have a small American flag carefully positioned exactly one boot ́s length away from the headstone. The flags were placed by 1,500 soldiers from the Army ́s 3rd Infantry Regiment, better known as The Old Guard. The regiment has carried out the tradition, known as 'Flags In,' just before Memorial Day every year since 1948, when it was designated as the Army ́s official ceremonial unit.

The 45-year-old novelist told an audience at the Hay Literature Festival: 'There are some politicians who, I won't name names, won't come on the podcast because it has the word \"fail\" in the title and they don't want to be seized upon. 'So if I really thought about it I might not have branded it that way. 'But I'm not fetishising the pursuit of failure. I'm simply saying that failure is something that happens to us all and it connects us which is really liberating.' Politicians who have braved the podcast have discussed their failures in Whitehall, their mental health problems and personal relationships. Elizabeth Day (pictured, in May at The Podcast Show in London) has revealed politicians won't be guests on her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail' Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive. Read More Clive Myrie reveals how he wouldn't report on the Notting Hill Carnival as he refused to be pigeonholed by the BBC In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talked about the failure in contraception that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction. The same year, the former Conservative politician Chris Patten went on the show to discuss losing his seat in the 1992 election and his time as Chairman of the BBC where he presided over the Jimmy Saville scandal. The Magpid author shared that her dream guests for the podcast were Sienna Miller, Michelle Obama, Beyonce and Taylor Swift - though the Midnights singer no longer does interviews. Speaking about her latest non-fiction project, Friendaholic, which shot to Number One on the Sunday Times Bestseller list, she encouraged people to have a wedding ceremony with their friends before getting married to their partner. She said: 'An audience member in Bath said that before she got married to her husband, she got married to her best friend because she thought that relationship was as important to her. 'I completely and utterly agree. - they'd gone into the woods and done a wedding ceremony and I thought that was genius. 'I think people should think about having platonic wedding ceremonies that I put it as an extra chapter in the paperback version of my book.' The Magpid author shared that one of her dream guests for the podcast was Beyonce The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera Ms Day got divorced from her first husband the BBC News Editorial director, Kamal Ahmed, who she divorced at 36 after four years of marriage in 2014 and is now married to CEO Justin Basini. The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera. She said: 'We quickly realised we worked way better as friends and he's been a very close friend of mine ever since.'

OceanGate's Titan submersible disappeared on June 18, 2023 , after it plunged into the sea to explore the wreck of the Titanic - killing all five people on board, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The cost of the expedition was $250,000. The company was slammed for flouting warnings of the risks and offering cut-price tickets to some of those on the trip. But despite the catastrophic implosion, rich thrill-seekers are still spending thousands on similar expeditions. One of the companies still operating deep sea dives, including an expedition back to the Titanic wreck, is Triton. Its operators insist their submersible is safer than Titan, which was criticized for having no official safety certification. America's super-wealthy are still risking their lives on deep sea adventures even after the catastrophic implosion of OceanGate 's Titan last year, that killed all on board (Pictured: next-generation Triton submersible, the Triton 660/9 AVA, called the Scenic Neptune II) They refused to share the per-person cost for a seat on their sub, or tell DailyMail.com when they plan to plunge to the depths of the Atlantic to reach the Titanic wreck. Triton's subs have been used in the past for the 'world's deepest dive' to Australia's Great Barrier Reef in July 2023 with British biologist Sir David Attenborough . This year, Triton subs were used for expeditions to the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Influential individuals have recognized how the tragic implosion could impact the investment in deep ocean research, said Sophie Bentham-Wood, Executive Director of Global Marketing and Sales Strategies for the leading submarine company Triton. 'Some have already approached us to discuss the build of deep-diving submersibles purely to counteract any negative impact those events could have had and maintain momentum in the ocean space,' Bentham-Wood told Dailymail.com. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor, is one of them. He is planning to be on the first sub to dive back to the titanic wreckage since the Titan imploded last June. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor (left) says he is signed up for an expedition to the Titanic later this year OceanGate 's Titan submersible (pictured) disappeared on June 18, 2023, after it plunged into the ocean to explore the wreck of the Titanic. The cost of the trip was $250,000 The sub diver is determined to prove submersing down 12,500 feet to the 112-year-old titanic wreckage is perfectly safe - and he has the money to do so. Connor is set on taking a two-person submersible down to titanic wreck depths to show people worldwide that 'while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He is planning the dive with Patrick Lahey, President and co-founder of Triton Submarines, one of the leading submersible companies in the world. The two have worked together previously diving to some of the ocean's deepest depths. Triton clients have already made various dives this year, from exploring the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Despite OceanGate's catastrophic implosion last June, the pair aims to prove to the world that such an expedition can be carried out safely. Connor, who has previously explored the Mariana Trench, the deepest oceanic trench on Earth, said they plan to undertake the journey in a two-person vessel called the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, named '4000' for the depth in meters it can reach. It's unclear when the trip will take place or how much it will cost.

'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com (Pictured: Project Hercules, a collab between Triton Submarines and Espen Øino International, a luxury sub) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades (Pictured: The world's first and only submersible certified 'Depth: Unlimited') The TRITON 660 AVA series employs our revolutionary Advanced Versatile Acrylics to create the world's first submersibles with a free-form acrylic pressure hull (Pictured: TRITON 660 AVA) The world’s deepest dive to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was achieved by Sir David Attenborough in a Triton submersible Lahey was among many industry figures who criticized OceanGate before and after the disaster, accusing it of questionable safety standards. After the implosion, he described Rush's recruitment tactics use to convincing people to get on board as 'quite predatory' and emphasized that certified submersibles are generally safe. Lahey emphasized that this tragedy wasn't reflecting of the industry as a whole. 'In that sense, OceanGate didn't make the industry look bad,' McCallum told the WSJ. 'It made us look good.' Lahey said that after the implosion, Connor called him saying, 'You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.' With respect to the lives lost last June, Bentham-Wood said the 'continued exploration of the deep ocean in manned submersibles is essential to understanding the ocean environment, which is a key component of our future on this planet.' 'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com 'Plus everyone realizes the deep ocean is no place for compromise – therefore, the need for programs to solely employ submersibles with full classification certification in their operations is not an option, but a prerequisite.' Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members Dakar - World's Record Deep Sea Dive (1954) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades. When the wreck of the Titanic was first first discovered in 1985, submersibles had already been diving to greater depths for several decades. The first to do so was the FNRS-3 bathyscaphe in 1954, setting a record by reaching 4,050 meters. In 1960, the Trieste descended 10,916 meters in the Mariana Trench. Since then, at least 16 submersibles have repeatedly taken people deeper than the Titanic over the past 69 years. The US submersible Alvin made the first dives to investigate the Titanic in July 1986, followed by the French submersible Nautile in 1987, which returned in 1993 and dived to the wreck 47 times in total. Today, ten submersibles in service can reach Titanic depths and beyond. According to the Marine Technology Society's submarine group, OceanGate was the only company operating a submersible capable of reaching Titanic-wreck depths that was not certified, raising industry concerns. 'There are only 10 submarines in the world that can go 4,000m or deeper and all of them are certified except the OceanGate,' Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society's submarine group told CBC News in June 2023. OceanGate was conducting deep-ocean expeditions since 2009, with over 200 successful dives using its three submersibles in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The Titan was designed to reach deeper depths of over 13,000 feet, according to the company. Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members. British explorer Hamish Harding was among those killed in the 'catastrophic implosion' French Navy veteran PH Nargeolet (left) was in the sub along with Stockton Rush (right), CEO of the OceanGate Expedition But after the implosion, many in the industry called for extra caution around any future trips to the titanic wreckage. Other have called for greater oversight of the submersible industry as a whole. Last year, titanic expert Tim Maltin said trips to the wreckage should be paused until more is discovered about what occurred to the Titan sub. 'We need to make sure that any vessels that go down there carrying fee-paying passengers...[are] certified to greater depths than they will be put through,' said Maltin. Caroline Heaven, a member of the British Titanic Society, said the dangers outweigh any benefits. 'I see no point in even considering the perilous journey to the wreck,' she told the BBC . 'The dangers involved are too great, the conditions are too cramped, and visibility is limited when the wreck is reached. Debris from the Titan submersible recovered from the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic, is unloaded from a ship 'Out of the entire population of submersibles, 90 to 95 per cent are certified. There's a five to 10 per cent fringe, so in that aspect they are an outlier, but sure, in the deep submersibles they really stand out.'

On June 18, the OceanGate's Titan was launched around 8am in the Atlantic Ocean above the site of the Titanic shipwreck. The five passengers, tourists Hamish Harding , 58, Shahzada Dawood , 48, and his son Sulaiman Dawood, 19, French Navy pilot Paul-Henry (PH) Nargeolet and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, started to descend as Rush piloted the vessel. At 9:45am, the ship lost contact with its mothership, the Polar Prince, during a descent to the wreck of the Titanic 12,500 feet beneath the surface. Days later, its debris was recovered. It was said to have suffered a 'catastrophic implosion'. All on board died on the submersible. The US Coast Guard confirmed the victims' deaths four days later and an investigation into the implosion is ongoing . Because OceanGate's titan completely imploded, researchers will likely never determine the exact location of the flaw that caused the tragic event.

        "content": "Netflix fans are unimpressed with Jennifer Lopez’s new flick. The trailer for her new project Atlas has received poor reception from some viewers who flocked to social media to share their thoughts. Over on X/Twitter under a clip from the preview, one person wrote: “Absolute garbage, that’s as much as I’ll watch of this, the acting is hollow. Hard to watch even this amount of it.” Another person simply branded it “awful” while one said: “Why as a society [do] we keep doing this. Not sure I was looking for JLo action movie.” More comments flooded in, with one scathing remark stating: “What is this, 1999?” However, someone praised Lopez’s hard work and quipped: “She been working like the rent due lately, I respect it.” Jennifer’s brand new science-fiction thriller follows data analyst Atlas Shepherd who is wary about artificial intelligence. She joins a mission to capture a robot but is forced to worked with AI. The Jenny From The Block singer spoke out about the film and said: “I loved that this is a big sci-fi action movie, but at its core it’s a story of friendship and a love story, in a way. I always see everything as a love story, but this is a different kind of love between two beings who connect in disastrous circumstances and teach each other how to be more human.” Elsewhere in news, one freaky film has left streamers with “so many questions” after watching and discovering a “hidden message”. Leave The World Behind is an apocalyptic psychological thriller film which stars Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke and Kevin Bacon as a group of people navigating an apocalyptic event. The film follows Amanda who plans a vacation with her family as the world suffers a cyber attack. The “catastrophic environmental effects” begin to play out and creepy scenes show teeth falling out, dead-eyed deer that haunt the family and a piercing alarm. Fans over in the Netflix Bangers Facebook group said that the film was “kind of freaky but a good watch” and that they “enjoyed” the thriller as one person urged: “Love it.

'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine . 'Each year, our country, and I say our country because it is our country, sends billions of dollars to maintain an apartheid government and support the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,' said Tlaib. 'It is disgraceful that the Biden administration and my colleagues in Congress continue to smear them for protesting to save lives, no matter faith or ethnicity,' she said, referring to the pro-Gaza protesters that have popped up at universities and elsewhere throughout the country.' Tlaib was behind a group of Arab activists who convinced Michigan Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in the state's primary to protest the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine war. 'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine Tlaib also tore into Biden for saying Israel is not committing 'genocide' as its defense forces push further into the southern city of Rafah. It comes as Hamas fired rockets from Rafah toward Tel Aviv for the first time in four months, signaling the militant group is still capable of threatening Israel. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. 'The International Court of Justice just ruled that the Israeli government must stop its invasion of Rafah, but President Biden says what's happening [in Gaza] is not a genocide,' the 'Squad' member said. 'Where's your red line, President Biden?' 'Attacking the authority of the International Criminal Court and interfering in the legal process is nothing more, nothing more than an attempt to prevent the genocidal maniac Netanyahu and his senior Israeli officials from being held accountable for those crimes against humanity.' 'You are an enabler,' Tlaib said to Biden. 'But we're not going to forget in November, are we?'

At least 45 people were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah over the weekend, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel, meanwhile, said it killed two 'senior Hamas terrorists' there and is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area.' Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the rockets fired from Rafah proved 'the IDF must operate in every place Hamas still operates from, and, as such, the IDF will continue to operate wherever necessary.' Close to 36,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict since October 7, when Hamas killed some 1,160 Israelis and kidnapped over 200 . Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in addition to Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and as Mohammed Deif, who is behind its armed wing. 'We don't recognize their jurisdiction — the ICC — the way it's being exercised,' Biden told reporters last week during a press conference with Kenyan President William Ruto. 'It's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.' Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Pro-Palestine demonstrators march holding a banner expressing their opinion in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, N.Y., in mid-May 'Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide,' Biden had said earlier. 'We reject that. And we'll always stand with Israel and its — in the threats against its security.' In an olive branch to progressives and Arab-American voters, Biden publicly touted a pause on the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel on May 8 in protest of the IDF pushing into Rafah, where some 1.4 million Palestinians took shelter as many of their homes in the northern part of Gaza had been razed. But shortly after that the Biden administration announced a $1 billion arms deal with Israel - and the U.S. will continue to supply Israel with weapons even as they push into Rafah. That package includes $700m in tank ammunition, $500m in tactical vehicles and $60m in mortar rounds.

        "content": "Crisco inferno? A Connecticut woman is lucky to be alive after a half-baked attempt to extinguish a grease fire literally blew up in her face, as seen in this video setting the internet ablaze. “This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO,” warned LaTeasha Brost in the caption to the clip, which boasts over 6.2 million views on TikTok. In the viral footage, the TikToker is seen cooking in her kitchen, when all of a sudden, a fire erupts in the pan. “What do I do?” cries the petrified Brost, who decides to try and douse the blaze with water. Unfortunately, this backfires horribly, creating a giant fireball. Terrified, Brost flees to the living room and chucks the flaming pot, which nearly hits her dog, before she trips and falls in the living room. Thankfully, the fire appeared to go out on its own. Why did the water paradoxically act as an accelerant? As Brost pointed out, the inferno was an oil-based blaze, Yahoo News reported. When water is combined with grease, it sinks beneath the less-dense oil, pushing the grease to the surface. This water then rapidly heats and vaporizes, propelling the flaming top layer of oil into the air and creating a flaming greaseball. Thankfully, Brost said there was no “apartment damage” and that she only sustained second-degree burns in the freak accident. She said she hopes that sharing the video will help prevent others from making the “same mistake.” “It’s okay if you laugh,” she added. “This is your sign to get a fire extinguisher or fire blanket in your kitchen ... We didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did.” It’s okay if you laugh...there was no apartment damage and luckily only recieved 2nd degree burns. This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO! Sharing this because we didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did. Social media had a field day with the flaming fiasco. “The accidental stop drop and roll is insane,” exclaimed one bemused viewer, while another wrote, “not you almost throwing the fire ON your dog.” Brost clarified in the comments that she chucked the pan because it was burning her skin. “The important thing is that you didn’t panic,” snarked one TikTok wit. “Friendly reminder not to add water to a grease fire,” advised one social media Samaritan. In the event of a grease fire, people are advised to turn off the stove and cover the pot with a non-glass lid or other pot to starve the flames of oxygen, ABC 27 reported. Failing that, one should try and put it out with an extinguisher or call 911 if the fire’s raging out of control.",

        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has criticised a “siloed” approach to disability services and problems in Ireland as he encouraged local authorities to help solve the housing crisis. At the launch of his party’s local and European manifesto in Dublin, Mr Harris said that he was “sick and tired of the national pass the parcel” in relation to disability services in Ireland. He said Fine Gael would promote a universal design approach for travel and playgrounds and invest in sensory spaces in libraries. “Parents don’t care, children don’t care about it, I don’t care about who does the job – we just need to get it done,” he said. He also said that housing was “the defining societal issue” in Ireland and went beyond a crisis to an “inter-generational anxiety”. He called for a review of the bulk purchase of houses by institutional investors. “I’m pleased with a number of the measures the housing minister and the finance minister have brought in, I think they’ve been good, I think they’ve been effective, but I don’t think we can close our ears in relation to this.” He also said local authorities would be “held to account” for their housing delivery, and said it was “about time every part of the public service puts their shoulder to the wheel”. Asked about the comments afterwards, Mr Harris said: “I don’t say this to be critical, but there isn’t a consistency in relation to the delivery of housing across the country. “And I don’t say that to be critical, the reason I make that point is because sometimes there can be blockages. So this is not about local government and national government having a spat here.” He said he wanted to know if there were “blockages” or resourcing issues behind why some local authorities take longer than others to “turn a vacant property into a home for a family”. He added: “I don’t want to be blaming anybody, nor them blaming us, but I want every arm of this state to work together because what I can tell you, seven weeks as Taoiseach, I am concerned genuinely about the siloed approach that is taken to problems in this country. “I have huge respect for our public servants, I described them as the best in the world today at the National Economic Dialogue, that is my view. But I do sometimes think there can be ‘that’s a matter for somebody else’, ‘that’s a matter for that agency’. The public are sick and tired of that. “I have a very low threshold in terms of tolerance for that. I want to fix housing once and for all and I want everyone to play their part in that.”",

        "content": "The Trans-Canada Highway will be reduced to single lane southbound traffic between Thicke and Edgelow roads near Ladysmith during the daytime starting Monday, May 27. Officials urge caution at the intersection of Thicke Road and the TCH as crews are working on drainage in the area. According to a news release issued May 24 by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, “The work protects the long-term resiliency of the highway as flooding from nearby drains had been affecting the road base.” The ministry noted that the timing of the construction was selected “based on weather and low traffic-volume times to ensure minimal impact to travellers in advance of the summer travel season.” Work is expected to take two weeks. The highway will be fully open overnight and on the weekends though at the end of the two-week work period, the southbound slow lane will require 24-hour a day closure for five days to complete repairs. “Drivers are reminded to observe traffic management personnel and signage in the area, and drive with caution in active construction zones,” said the release.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Immigration Minister Marc Miller is lifting the cap on Palestinian who can be brought by relatives to Canada through a program that faces widespread criticism. Miller speaks during an announcement in the Foyer of the House of Commons, in Ottawa, Thursday, May 23, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be \"accepted into processing,\" but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn't know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can't currently exit the Gaza Strip. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,\" Miller said. \"With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.\" There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.",

SteelSeries’ ClearCast 2 microphone — found on its flagship Arctis Nova Pro headset — makes its way onto the new Arctis Nova 5, albeit in an updated (and seemingly better) version the brand is calling ClearCast 2.X. The updated mic features a new chipset it claims will deliver both twice the bandwidth and twice the clarity, as well as supporting 32KHz/16Bit audio to help to deliver clean and clear sound in-game and during conversations.Along with the new headset, SteelSeries is launching the Nova 5 Companion App — an app that the brand created with the help of game developers, esports pros, and its own audio engineers. It features over 100 game-specific audio presets that users can flip between at any time — including whilst playing — with profiles included for many of the most popular titles like Fortnite and Minecraft. With the Modern Warfare III preset, for example, users can expect to hear “enhanced footsteps”, providing them with an advantage in close quarter combat scenes.Connectivity wise, the Arctis Nova headset has it all: users can choose to use Bluetooth or a high-speed 2.4GHz connection with the included dongle, with supported systems including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Meta Quest and more. Session gamers can expect to get up to 60 hours of wireless play on a single charge, and with its fast charging capability via USB-C it takes just 15 minutes to get from empty to six hours worth of juice.

        "content": "Article content Playoff Game Day 3.3 Dallas at Edmonton In the early days of Edmonton Oilers’ third round series with Dallas Stars, two persistent questions have bubbled to the surface time and again. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch answered both questions at once on Monday morning, announcing that Henrique will replace Ryan McLeod in the line-up as the series lands in Rogers Place for Game 3 this evening. It’s a move that’s been called for by numerous fans of the team, who have called out McLeod’s perceived poor play in various corners of social media not to mention the comments section right here at the Cult of Hockey. There’s no doubt that McLeod has struggled mightily on the offensive side of the puck. 14 games into the playoffs he has yet to record a single point, this after ending the regular season on a 15-game goalless run. Until recently he has maintained his high-level defensive play, but some cracks have developed there as well. Our own analysis of Grade A Shots has identified the speedy forward as a culprit on 3 different goals against in the last 4 games, most notably a dreadful third-period turnover in Vancouver that kickstarted a scary Canucks comeback. In Game 2 at Dallas, McLeod was a split-second late to the shooting lane on Ryan Suter’s outside shot that was deflected home by Mason Marchment for the game winner. Not the biggest mistake of the game or even on the sequence itself, but another mark on the debit side of a ledger that has entered precious few credits at the other end of the sheet. McLeod has played a role in Edmonton’s outstanding penalty kill in the post-season, playing 22 minutes without a single goal against. At even strength, the Oilers have produced 57% of the shots and 55% of the expected goals during his 163 minutes of action. When it comes to actual goals, however, it’s been just 1 for, 6 against, for a dismal 14%. And let’s face it, folks, boxcars of 0-0-0, -5 are deeply underwhelming. Thus he is about to endure the first healthy scratch of his career at a critical time. Coach Knoblauch referred to it as a “reset”, a similar approach that he successfully used with netminder Stu Skinner in the Vancouver series. The expectation is that he will be back in the rotation sooner than later. But not tonight. All that said, team speed is going to take a hit. McLeod is clearly one of the squad’s two fastest skaters, with only Connor McDavid in the same conversation. Henrique is a different animal, especially on the speed front. Nearly 10 years older, he’s nowhere near as fast as McLeod, though much more of a threat offensively. In 2023-24 he produced his seventh 20-goal season, and tied his career high of 51 points. He also hit 50 two other times, and has reached 40+ on ten different occasions over his 13 seasons. That said he checks many of the same boxes as McLeod on the versatility front. Both men can play either centre or wing and can chip in on the penalty kill. Injured in Game 5 of the Los Angeles series, Henrique tested his battered ankle in Game 2 vs. Vancouver but was ineffective. He hasn’t played since, missing Edmonton’s last 7 games. in 6 playoff games, he’s posted boxcars of 1-1-2, -1 averaging 15 minutes a night mostly at 1LW. First report is that Henrique will be airlifted directly into McLeod’s spot at 3C with no other changes to the line-up. More to come.",

        "description": "Economic growth and job creation are how the DA’s Multi-party Charter will ‘rescue Mzansi’ in the 2024 elections, says its leader ...",
        "content": "The Democratic Alliance party leader wrapped up his election campaign ahead of Wednesday’s vote by urging Mzansi to support the DA’s Multi-party Charter. John Steenhuisen wants South African’s to put corruption, poverty and unemployment in the rearview mirror and support the DA’s Multi-Party Charter, reports The Citizen . DA’S MULTI-PARTY CHARTER IS IN WITH A CHANCE “Together (referring to the DA’s Multi-Party Charter) we can get to the 51% we need to rescue South Africa. For the first time, there is a clear pathway into national government. By uniting with our partners inside the Multi-party Charter, we have pooled together the biggest bloc of opposition votes since 1994,” confirmed Steenhuisen. Made up of the IFP, FF Plus, ActionSA, ISANCO, UIM and SNP, the DA’s Multi-party Charter has centered its manifesto on the following topics. Unemployment and poverty reduction through economic growth and a return to global competitiveness. The plan was presented earlier in the year by ActionSA’s Herman Mashaba. As a coalition, the parties represent the biggest alternative political bloc to the ANC ever. When the 29 May 2024 vote concludes, they will cobble together their electoral wins based upon the following agreed principles ... MAKE MZANSI GREAT AGAIN ANC WILL LOSE MAJORITY Steenhuisen also remarked that, “The ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades. This is because it subjected the people to unemployment, corruption and misrule. We will close the ANC chapter of our history once and for all. And a new chapter will begin.” Independent polls in the run-up to Wednesday’s election predict the DA to land roughly 20.5% of the vote, which is similar to previous elections. Nevertheless, Steenhuisen vowed to bring the best municipal and provincial leadership to government, as it has done in the Western Cape. “If we sit back and allow a coalition between the ANC, EFF and MK – aided by sell outs like the PA – our tomorrow will be far, far worse than our yesterday,” concluded Steenuisen. HAVE YOUR SAY Would you vote for DA’s Multi-party Charter in the 2024 National Elections? Despite their combined efforts, the charter maintains each individual party has its own unique policies you should consider.

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Tom Burke, left, and Anya Taylor-Joy in a scene from \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP) Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

        "content": "SEOUL: Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries’ first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic but also to once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit — a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged North Korea to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would “undermine regional and global peace and stability”. Yoon also called for a “decisive” international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch — aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea’s most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries reaffirmed their commitment to the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, adding that peace “serves our common interest and is our common responsibility”. North Korea hit back immediately, saying in a statement by a foreign ministry spokesperson that “to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula today constitutes a grave political provocation.” Any talk of denuclearization would “violate the constitutional position of our country as a nuclear weapons state,” said the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. “Such thing as ‘complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula’ has already died out theoretically, practically and physically,” it added. Differences As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea’s nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China’s relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has blamed US-South Korea joint military drills for escalating regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement “clearly showed the difference of opinions” between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un’s regime was always going to be difficult “because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country”, Lee told AFP. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is a good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim’s nukes. “If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,” he added. Trade ties The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange “discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA”, and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China’s Li also said they had agreed on not turning “economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains”, Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China’s top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were “closely monitoring and tracking” preparations for another launch—which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. “North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week,” said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. “One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.” — AFP",

        "description": "Aston Villa are playing Champions League football in the new season having finished fourth - they're looking to aim in one direction under Unai Emery",
        "content": "Aston Villa are a short price to repeat their top four achievement of the recently ended season, when they tackle the Premier League again next term. Villa overcame the odds, which were against them, in securing Champions League football for the forthcoming campaign ahead of the likes of Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and last season's top four occupants Newcastle United. Next year, they'll have to try and repeat the feat while juggling their Champions League campaign , which will entail a minimum of eight matches throughout the autumn and winter in the new 36-team league table format. After Southampton's victory over Leeds United in the Championship play-off final on Sunday, thanks to Adam Armstrong's first-half winner, Villa now know the confirmed line up of opponents who they'll face over the course of the Premier League campaign next season. After this previous term's achievements, Villa are understandably nearer the top of the list with the various bookmakers' odds than towards the bottom. READ: Emery has already paid Barkley a compliment ahead of Villa transfer READ: Villa squad value skyrockets before Barkley transfer and Champions League Premier League title odds: Manchester City 10/11, Arsenal 9/4, Liverpool 8/1, Chelsea 20/1, Manchester United 25/1, Newcastle United 25/1, Tottenham Hotspur 33/1, Aston Villa 50/1, BAR 150/1 Villa are a good bit shorter a price to match this past season's achievements; a top four finish, when you consider the strength and likely improvements of those within the 'Big Six' who comparably underachieved this term, would be another fine effort - particularly, as mentioned, with Villa set to fight amongst the elite both domestically and in Europe this coming year. Top four finish odds: Manchester City 1/10, Arsenal 1/4, Liverpool 8/15, Chelsea 11/8, Newcastle United 7/4, Manchester United 2/1, Tottenham Hotspur 2/1, Aston Villa 3/1, BAR 12/1 (Odds: Bet 365) Where will Villa finish next season?

Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. Speaking after the match, Nadal said: 'For me it is difficult to say what is going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here, but I cannot say 100 per cent. 'The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. 'I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.' Rafael Nadal refuses to rule out a French Open return after first round defeat on Monday Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Many believe that this was Nadal's last appearance at the tournament he has won 14 times Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

However, the former heavyweight champion is doing fine after medical attention and his representatives said that he is feeling better now. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" Tyson's representatives told The New York Post in an email. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Typical symptoms of an ulcer flare-up include nausea and vomiting, bloating, belching, gas pain, chest pain, and fatigue. This follows In Touch's initial report on Monday morning that Tyson \"had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded.\" Sources indicate that the cabin crew \"issued an announcement asking for a doctor 30 minutes before landing, and the message even came on everyone's screens.\" \"He was in first class, but we were an exit row,\" an eyewitness added. \"They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, 'He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.' I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words \"Mike Tyson\" and she nodded her head yes.\" Once the plane landed at LAX, there was an additional delay of around 25 minutes while paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson, who has previously admitted to daily marijuana use, has given up the drug while training to fight Paul because it is on the list of banned substances used by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. He also revealed he has temporarily given up sex as part of his training regimen. \"He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,\" his publicist Joann Mignano recently told USA TODAY Sports. \"But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his personal well-being and others like him.\" Tyson will turn 58 on July 20, when the fight against Paul is scheduled to take place at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Cowboys. The has faced criticism in recent weeks, especially due to the significant age gap between the two fighters. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition match in November 2020 against Roy Jones Jr. in , which was not declared a professional fight.",

        "content": "The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday, dismissed the petition filed by Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), challenging the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel, chaired by Justice Ado Birnin–Kudu, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners; PRP and its governorship candidate, Abdullahi Bayawo, failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 during the poll. The tribunal, in a unanimous judgment, held that the petitioners’ evidence that Forms EC8B and EC8D (the ward result sheets and the state result sheets) tendered were not prepared for the Nov. 11, 2023 poll, were bereft of substance. The panel said that the testimonies of the petitioners’ witnesses were hearsay and that failure to call polling agents from the alleged affected polling units to give their evidence was fatal to the case of the petitioners. Besides, it held that some of the evidence of the witnesses had no probative value. “The petition lacks merit and it is accordingly dismissed,” Justice Birnin–Kudu-led tribunal declared. It held that the election that produced Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor of Kogi complied substantially with the provisions of the Electoral Act . Earlier, the tribunal dismissed the petition filed by Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka, against Gov. Ododo. The tribunal held that the petitioners also failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission. It would be recalled that the tribunal had, on Feb. 20, struck out the petition filed by the Action Peoples Party (APP) against the election victory of Ododo in the Nov. 11 governorship poll in the state. The panel struck out the petition following its withdrawal by counsel for APP, Daniel Edeachi. The application, seeking the withdrawal of the petition was not opposed by lawyer to Gov. Ododo, Ibrahim Muhammed, SAN; counsel to APC, DC Denwigwe, SAN, and that of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Kanu Agabi, SAN. The APP had, in the petition number: EPR/KG/GOV/02/2023 filed on Dec. 1, 2023, before the tribunal, challenged the declaration of Ododo as the validly elected governor of Kogi in the Nov. 11, 2023 governorship poll conducted by INEC. The party had sued Ododo, APC and INEC as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively. However, in its motion on notice dated and filed on Feb. 15, the party sought two orders, including an order granting leave to the petitioner/applicant to withdraw the Petition No: EPT/KG/GOV/01/2023 and an order striking out or dismissing the petition, having been withdrawn by the petitioner. Giving eight-ground of argument, APP said though it filed the petition to challenge Ododo’s victory, the party said upon the re-evaluation of the grounds and facts of the petition, it “is not reasonably convinced about the sustainability of the grounds of the petition as presently constituted before this honourable tribunal. According to the party, the withdrawal of the petition is based on the perceived unsustainability of the grounds of the petition and to avoid overburdening this honourable tribunal with numerous petitions.(NAN)",

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as \"vital\" in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has \"its own large reserves of uranium.\" Putin, in turn, vowed to \"do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.\" If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

There are only conjectures, assumptions, and thoughts which the so-called experts had. It is a report of experts which is at times contradictory, and which the magistrate did not make her own considerations on but simply issued charges based on it,” Muscat said in a video posted to social media.He said that €11 million and four-and-a-half years had been spent to find a €60,000 transfer for work that he had done and that he himself had told them about because he had declared it in his tax filings.The €60,000 refers to money Muscat received for unnamed consultancy services from Accutor AG.Muscat said that despite this, an asset freezing order worth €30 million was issued without any justification as to where that figure came from.The former Prime Minister continued that “in this second Egrant” it seems that someone relied on the testimony of “an Indian national” who said he heard someone say that Muscat might have taken millions in connection with the hospitals deal – millions which, Muscat pointed out, were never found.Muscat said that the narrative now is ‘but what might Joseph have known or not known?’ and said that he would answer about this “when the time comes.”He said he also looks forward to answering about a comment in the report where the experts say that there wasn’t any proof about the work that he had done for the €60,000, questioning why he hadn’t been asked to testify about this matter.“Now I will give this evidence when the time comes in court to show how much work was actually done and back it up with proven facts,” he said.Muscat continued that the court process will now start, and observed that even before the first sitting, charges against a company have already been dropped because it didn’t even exist when this case was investigated.He said that the problem is that the case will unfortunately take long, but said that he is “resolute and focused” to “destroy this sand castle built on a lot of conjectures once and for all with a tsunami of facts and proof that I will bring forward in the future.”He thanked people for their support in these times which he said will test their resolve. He called for people to maintain their calm and serenity, as he has no doubt that “very important facts” will emerge to show that there are people who are again trying to push a lie “against him”, “which will now turn on those who were doing it.”",

        "content": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday it is \"obscene\" that small island states, which are on the front line of climate change, should pay for the fossil fuel industry's greed and competition between major economies. \"Your unique geography puts you at the mercy of climate chaos, rising sea levels and land degradation,\" Guterres said at the opening of the fourth Small Island Developing States (SIDS) summit in the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. \"Climate change is an existential crisis for the entire human family, but SIDS are on the front lines,\" he told the conference of 39 states, whose populations number roughly 65 million people. SIDS are extremely vulnerable to climate change but not rich enough to stop it on their own. One key hope from the summit is increased climate financing -- though many criticize the slow pace of fulfilling previous UN aid pledges. \"We cannot accept the disappearance of any country or culture under the rising waves,\" Guterres said. \"The idea that an entire island state could become collateral damage for profiteering by the fossil fuel industry, or competition between major economies, is simply obscene,\" he added. Guterres said the United Nations supported SIDS' aspirations to \"halt and mitigate the terrible impacts of the climate crisis,\" as well as to protect the ocean and biodiversity, and to build resilient economies. He urged SIDS governments to invest and engage in these goals but said they \"cannot do this alone.\" \"The international community has a duty to support you –- led by the countries that have greatest responsibility and capacity to deal with the challenges you face,\" Guterres said. \"SIDS are a test case for climate justice and financial justice,\" he added. Last week, the UN maritime court ruled in favor of nine small island states that brought a case to seek increased protection of the world's oceans from catastrophic climate change. The countries that brought the case called the court decision \"historic,\" and experts said it could be influential in shaping the scope of future climate litigation involving greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "content": "VIENNA - Iran is enriching uranium to close to weapons-grade at a steady pace while discussions aimed at improving its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog are stalled, two confidential reports by the watchdog showed on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency faces a range of difficulties in Iran, including the fact it only implemented a small fraction of the steps IAEA chief Rafael Grossi thought it committed to in a \"Joint Statement\" on cooperation last year. \"There has been no progress in the past year towards implementing the Joint Statement of 4 March 2023,\" one of the two reports to member states, both of which were seen by Reuters, said. Grossi travelled to Iran this month for talks with Iranian officials aimed at improving cooperation and IAEA monitoring in Iran. Follow-up talks have stalled, however, after the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last week. \"The Director General reiterates to the new government of Iran his call for, and disposition to continue with, the high-level dialogue and ensuing technical exchanges commenced ... on 6-7 May 2024,\" the report added. It is 18 months since the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors last passed a resolution against Iran, ordering it to cooperate urgently with a years-long IAEA investigation into uranium particles found at three undeclared sites. While the number of sites has since been reduced to two, Iran has still not explained how the traces got there. \"The Director General regrets that the outstanding safeguards issues have not been resolved,\" the report said, referring to those traces. France and Britain are pushing for a new resolution at next week's Board meeting, which the United States has so far not supported, diplomats say. Iran usually bristles at such resolutions, taking nuclear-related steps in response. The other report said Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, grew by 20.6 kg over the quarter to 142.1 kg as of May 11, and Iran later diluted 5.9 kg to a lower enrichment level. That means Iran now has roughly enough material enriched to up to 60% purity, if enriched further, for three nuclear weapons in theory, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough for more at lower enrichment levels. Western powers say there is no credible civil reason for Iran to enrich to that level. Iran says its aims are peaceful. REUTERS",

        "content": "The secret is out on the next Chelsea women's manager, writes KATHRYN BATTE... but whether Sonia Bompastor will succeed remains to be seen Lyon manager Sonia Bompastor is on the cusp of a move to take over at Chelsea Her last game came on Saturday during her side's Champions League final loss Plymouth job will be the one that makes or breaks Wayne Rooney's managerial career - Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Kathryn Batte Published: 18:00 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:02 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Sonia Bompastor laughed when she was asked for the second time whether Saturday’s Champions League final had been her last game in charge of Lyon. The first time had been in French, but because the question that had been asked was not translated, it was later repeated in English. Some managers would have snapped. She had just lost a European final for the first time as manager and was probably not in the mood to discuss where she will be next season. But she does not seem the type to do so. She knows as well as the rest of us that it is the worst kept secret in women’s football that she will soon be announced as Emma Hayes’ successor at Chelsea . Bompastor has been manager of Lyon since 2021, winning seven trophies - including three back-to-back league titles and the 2021-2022 Champions League. Sonia Bompastor (pictured) laughed during a press conference after the Women's Champions League final Her Lyon side cut dejected figures after they suffered a 2-0 defeat by Barcelona during Saturday's final The match may have been Bompastor's (centre) final game as Lyon boss, as speculation mounts that she will now move to succeed Emma Hayes at Chelsea Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola?

The absence of star striker Ada Hegerberg, who was only fit enough for a place on the bench, proved crucial. Barca dominated possession but both teams had the same number of shots and clear chances. The difference was Barca took two of theirs, even if they needed a bit of luck with a heavy deflection for the first goal. Bompastor will leave Lyon with a fine record but, in truth, it is hard to measure her success.

Bompastor, who also played for Lyon, had been coach of the club’s academy for eight years. She could not stop PSG from going on to win the French league, which subsequently ended Lyon’s 14-year reign as champions, but she has since re-established their position at the top. Lyon have won the last three titles and beat Barca in the 2022 Champions League final - which made her the first person to win the competition as both a player and a manager. But she also inherited a talented squad. She will do the same at Chelsea, but the Women’s Super League is far more competitive, with more teams challenging for trophies than in France. Hayes (pictured) had become the unofficial spokesperson of women's football in England during her glittering reign as Chelsea manager The former Chelsea manager guided the Blues to their fifth consecutive Women's Super League title last week Read More Lionesses icon Steph Houghton isn't short of options for what's next after retirement... while top priority is husband Stephen Darby, she will keep fighting for the women's game What may work in Bompastor’s favour is that there will be less of a spotlight on her than her predecessor. As I discussed in this column last week, Hayes had become the unofficial spokesperson for women’s football in England. The same will not be expected of Bompastor. Hayes worked with Bompastor, who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom in America. Hayes described her as a ‘brilliant player’ with an ‘unbelievable wand of a left foot.’ She also said she was ‘very quiet’ but ‘cheeky’ and ‘funny’ - traits she argued the media may not always see. The description Hayes gave of Bompastor mirrors what some of her former players have said. A manager who is passionate, fiercely determined and demands high standards. She is also said to be deceptively loud. Dare I say she sounds an awful lot like England manager Sarina Wiegman, who has many of the same traits. Hayes worked with Bompastor (pictured), who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom Bompastor brings proven experience of winning the Women's Champions League, the one trophy that has seemingly evaded the Blues in recent years Much like at Lyon, Bompastor will enter a dressing room at Chelsea that is used to winning. The Blues have lifted five successive WSL titles but the one competition that has evaded them is the Champions League. Bompastor’s experience in that competition will be key and it is one of the big reasons Chelsea wanted to bring her in. Read More Emma Hayes helped transform women's football in this country... but after her exit from Chelsea, it has to move on without her, writes KATHRYN BATTE But Bompastor will be responsible for more than just tactics and formations. Hayes spoke regularly about having to manage people and personalities. Chelsea’s squad depth meant players who could walk into other starting XI’s did not always make her matchday squad. Bompastor knows all about this from her time at Lyon and it will not faze her. The switch from Hayes to Bompastor will be fascinating to watch next season. While we are unlikely to get references to Star Wars, geese or poetry in press conferences next season, perhaps in time we will get to see the cheeky and funny side to Bompastor that Hayes promised us is in there. The switch from Hayes (right) to Bompastor (left) will certainly be a fascinating one Bompastor will sign off her time at Lyon having guided her side to the Division 1 Feminine title Brilliant Bronze is Britain's best export Lucy Bronze said her Barcelona team will go down in history after winning their first ever quadruple. But it is not just the team, but Bronze herself who will be remembered in the history books. The defender became the first English player to win five Champions League trophies on Saturday and is now the country’s most decorated player. Bronze has not always started for Barca this season, but she put in a fine display against her former club Lyon. There have been a number of discussions recently about who is the best English player to play abroad. Usually, the answers range from Kevin Keegan, who won the Ballon d’Or while playing for Hamburg, to Steve McManaman, who won two European Cups with Real Madrid. But no English player has been more successful abroad than Bronze - who has won 16 trophies across her spells at Lyon and Barcelona. There is no doubt that, for me, she is the greatest English export we have ever seen. Lucy Bronze (pictured) became the first English player to win five Champions League titles on Saturday Bronze (pictured lifting the trophy) stated that her Barcelona team will go down in history The defender will also go down in history, too, as one of British football's greatest ever exports Scotland will play Israel behind closed doors It is a shame that Scotland’s Euro 2025 qualifier with Israel will have to take place behind closed doors due to security concerns. The Scottish FA said its stadium operations team were alerted to the potential for planned disruptions to the game at Hampden Park and therefore made the decision to stop supporters from attending. Safety is of course paramount but were other options, such as Police Scotland deploying extra force on the ground, explored? The women’s game in Scotland is still far behind England and having games behind closed doors will certainly not help. Scotland's Euro 2025 qualifier against Israel at Hampden Park will take place behind closed doors Referee Rebecca Welch (pictured) delivered an impressive performance during Saturday's Women's Champions League final Welch delivers impressive refereeing performance Barcelona far outnumbered Lyon fans at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, with over 40,000 of them making the short trip across Spain.

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah.

(AP) Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, (Monday morning AEST) which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said on Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” READ MORE: Community rallies for mother mourning death of her toddler son “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike on an area where displaced people were staying. (AP) Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets on Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X.

Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. (AP) Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses.

Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Police move into camp as US anti-war protests continue View Gallery Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "description": "The Celtics and the Mavericks have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Jrue Holiday, PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford.",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks saw room to improve, and they struck. Exactly one week before their first preseason game, the Celtics traded a haul for Jrue Holiday , sacrificing depth to bring in the savvy veteran point guard with plenty left in the tank. Dallas’ transformative trades came just before the Feb. 8 deadline, with PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford arriving in under-the-radar moves that gave the Mavericks a much-needed physicality boost. Those deals are paying serious dividends now. Boston and Dallas have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Holiday, Washington and Gafford. Here’s how they got here. Fresh off of their second consecutive trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics already appeared poised to be among the NBA’s best teams without Holiday. They had traded in June for Kristaps Porzingis, adding another All-Star to a roster headlined by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. The Porzingis trade didn’t come cheaply, however, as it cost Boston their defensive-minded point guard, Marcus Smart, who for years had served as the team’s gritty emotional leader. Boston seemed set to begin the season with Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon as its top point guards, until Holiday suddenly became available. Holiday — a three-time first-team selection for All-Defensive honors and a 2021 champion with Milwaukee — had just been traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in the blockbuster deal that sent Damian Lillard to the Bucks. Holiday, 33, didn’t fit into the rebuilding Blazers’ timeline, so on Oct. 1, they flipped him to Boston for Brogdon, center Robert Williams and two first-round picks. The do-it-all Holiday proved to be a seamless fit, averaging 12.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.8 assist per game for the 64-win Celtics while again making the All-Defensive second team. Holiday remained a consistent force throughout the playoffs but became even more impactful during the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, who boast the NBA’s highest-scoring offense. Holiday scored a season-high 28 points in Boston’s Game 1 win and made a critical defensive play in overtime. With the Celtics up by a point with 1:02 remaining in OT, Holiday’s smothering defense caused Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, a two-time All-Star, to lose control of the ball out of bounds. “He’s the best defender in the NBA,” Haliburton said afterward. “He has been for a long time.” Holiday finished with seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals and made 10 of his 16 field-goal attempts in Game 1. He followed that up with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting and 10 assists in Game 2. And in Game 3, Holiday again made a game-sealing defensive stop. With Boston up by a point and under 10 seconds remaining in regulation, Holiday met a surging Andrew Nembhard in the backcourt, remained glued to him as he cleared the 3-point line and stripped the ball away to put Boston up, 3-0, in the conference finals. The steal helped the Celtics overcome an 18-point deficit, as did Holiday’s 14 points and nine rebounds. “I just made a play,” Holiday said. “I kind of jumped his right hand and got the steal.” The Mavericks, meanwhile, tried to retool in the offseason after a disappointing 2022-23 season in which they failed to make the play-in tournament. They traded for center Richaun Holmes and signed forward Grant Williams and guard Seth Curry, hoping to improve the supporting cast around Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving . Those additions each fizzled, however, prompting the Mavs to remake their roster on deadline day. They sent Williams, Curry and a first-round pick to Charlotte for the forward Washington, a hard-nosed defender who shot at least 36.5% on 3-point attempts in three of his five NBA seasons. They shipped Holmes and draft compensation to the Wizards for Gafford, a rim-protecting center who is highly efficient around the basket. Washington shot just 42.1% from the field and 31.4% from deep in 29 regular season games with Dallas but came alive in the playoffs, particularly in the second round against top-seeded Oklahoma City. Washington scored at least 21 points in three consecutive games against the Thunder, making at least five 3-pointers in each. His two made free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in the series-clinching Game 6 were the final points in Dallas’ 117-116 win. He remained clutch in the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, making a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:56 remaining in Game 1 and another with 3:38 left in Game 3 — both of which proved to be game-winners. “Anything can happen out there on any given night,” Washington said after Sunday’s Game 3 victory put Dallas up, 3-0, in the series. “I’m just blessed to be able to be here in this position. ... We don’t take it for granted.” Despite being five inches shorter, the 6-7 Washington has also played tough defense against the 7-foot Karl-Anthony Towns, who repeatedly settled for 3-point attempts through the first three games and went only 3-of-22 from deep. Towns, a four-time All-Star who averaged 21.8 points per game in the regular season, is yet to eclipse 16 in the Western Conference Finals. Gafford, meanwhile, continues to serve as an effective lob option for Doncic. His alley-oop dunk with 34.8 seconds left in Game 3 served as the dagger in the Mavericks’ 116-107 win. The 6-10 Gafford is averaging 10.3 points per game on 65.2% against the towering Timberwolves, holding his own against 7-1 Rudy Gobert, who just won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year honor. Dallas’ addition of Gafford allows promising rookie center Dereck Lively to come off the bench. The athletic Lively, a top-10 pick who entered the league with raw potential, has thrived this postseason as a reserve, though he left Game 3 with a sprained neck. “Tests returned OK on Dereck Lively II’s neck but his availability for Game 4 remains unclear,” ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday. Gafford and Lively solidified a center position that the Mavericks have historically struggled to fill, outside of a pair of one-season stints with Tyson Chandler in 2010-11 and 2014-15, and a two-year stretch with Porzingis that never quite fit. Dallas is getting a combined 50.7 points per game this postseason from Doncic and Irving. Coincidentally, that’s exactly what Boston’s dynamic duo of Tatum and Brown were averaging entering Monday. Thanks to some shrewd trades, Dallas and Boston have much more in common than their standout superstars.",

        "content": "Japan tells residents to 'take cover' as North Korea launches rocket 'carrying spy satellite' off coast Japanese Prime Minister’s Office issued a missile alert for Okinawa North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November By Claudia Aoraha For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:32, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:41, 27 May 2024 e-mail 19 shares 49 View comments Japan issued an alert telling its residents to take cover after North Korea launched a rocket allegedly carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night. The rocket launch came just hours after the country's announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center at 10:44pm on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful.

Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. Kim Jong-Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs.

North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.

You must be an MP to qualify for the post! “Otherwise, he didn’t turn it down, the party appointed Tabitha Khumalo because Chamisa was not a member of Parliament.” Charamba responded: “I can share with you what the plan then was. Chamisa was going to get one of his MPs to cede a constituency to him in return for some ambassadorial posting. “Chamisa would have got into Parliament on that basis, itself founded on mutual understanding between parties. “The same idea had been agreed to with Tsvangirai although it got overtaken by GNU arrangements. “There is always a way out, as you saw with Mwonzora who became that even though he had been outside Parliament!!!!

        "content": "Kate Middleton, who's still receiving cancer treatment, is said to be very determined and desperate to attend the upcoming royal event with her husband Prince William and their children. The Princess of Wales, who's been out of sight since she announced her caner diagnosis in March, is eager to make a balcony appearance for Trooping the Colour in London on June 15. However, King Charles and William, according to an insider, \"are not impressed with the idea. \"William and King won't allow Catherine to return to the royal duties until her medical team gives Kate all-clear as she still continues her treatment.\" \"King Charles and William don't want Kate to take any risk as they are taking all necessary steps to ensure that the mother-of-three makes a smooth recovery,\" the source added. They continued: \"Kate Middleton is thankful for the time she's spending at home while focusing on her health, but very excited to attend the event that she and her kids eagerly await for almost a year. On the other hand, Buckingham Palace has also not revealed the details about Trooping the Colour, which is a ceremonial event performed every year on Horse Guards Parade in London to celebrate the official birthday of the British sovereign. It is also known as the Sovereign's Birthday Parade. Speculations are rife when the future Queen returns to royal duties. William, according to reports, has directed the Kensington Palace to maintain privacy protocols around Kate as his top priority is her health. Last year, King Charles took the royal salute and inspected the troops at Horse Guard's Parade before returning to Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast. Queen Camilla, Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis joined King Charles for the photo op of the day on the palace's balcony.",

        "description": "A similar Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\"",
        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ( WNCN ) — Two people were rescued just before a $1 million luxury 80-foot sport yacht sank off the coast of Florida Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The incident was reported just after 11:35 a.m. about 3 miles off St. Augustine Beach, a news release from the Coast Guard said. The operator of the Atlantis, an 80-foot sport yacht, said the vessel hit an object in the water and was sinking. The Coast Guard sent out a boat crew to assist and coordinated with St. John’s County Fire and Rescue, which soon arrived and plucked both people from the yacht. The Atlantis yacht appears to be a 1999 or early 2000s model of the Sunseeker Predator 80. A larger Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” A 2001 Predator that is 5 feet shorter than Atlantis, which sank Saturday, is listed for sale for $975,000. Sunseeker Predator 80 yacht, built in the United Kingdom, can accommodate up to six guests in four staterooms, with two crew members aboard. Atlantis has two Caterpillar diesel engines and can reach a top speed of 44 kn, or 50 mph, according to data from Boat International. A data sheet about Atlantis says the vessel is in the top 5% by speed in the world. After Saturday’s rescue, a hazard to navigation was broadcast to alert mariners about the yacht, which could cause damage to other vessels, according to the Coast Guard. The owner of the Atlantis will arrange for a salvage of the vessel, the Coast Guard said. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",

However, she will continue to do her work. We will also watch Abhira save Armaan's life. Ruhi will bring Armaan some clothing to try on for the wedding. She would tie the tie knot, but it would eventually start choking him. Abhira comes to the rescue, cutting the tie with a scissor. Ruhi shouts at Abhira for entering their room without knocking. She's furious because Abhira saved Armaan's life and became so close to him. Meanwhile, the next episode's preview indicated that Madhav found Abhira and Armaan's divorce papers. They have not yet been officially separated due to some provision. Madhav will do everything in his power to thwart Armaan-Ruhi's wedding since he wants his son to marry Abhira.

The unrest erupted over a French voting reform plan that Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their voice. As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that \"as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security\". \"That is the absolute priority,\" Macron added, ahead of a day of intensive meetings with local leaders. He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground. France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris's power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence. \"I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here,\" said Mike, a 52-year-old Kanak at a separatist roadblock north of the capital, on the eve of Macron's visit.

Extraordinary drone footage seen by The Sun shows how four armed terrorists were tracked along an alleyway inside the West Bank town of Nur al-Shams Tulkarm before being killed in a targeted strike. 11 Israeli troops use drones to target terrorists in Gaza and the West Bank 11 Panicked Hamas terrorists throw objects and fire shots at an Israeli drone 11 Another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists 11 A bomb is dropped from several hundred feet above, apparently killing the terrorists Israeli operators can be heard discussing the operation in the background while controlling a reconnaissance drone with a handset not much larger than a mobile, to track down the gunmen. The terrorists appear surprised by the drone as it flies close to them at around head height. The panicked insurgents begin throwing objects at the drone, with one firing shots from his weapon, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) operator withdraws from the alleyway. Meanwhile, another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists and drops a bomb from several hundred feet above, apparently killing all four. The footage appears to end with the drone camera zooming in on the lifeless bodies of the four gunmen.

        "content": "CHINESE president Xi Jinping could betray his outcast ally Vladimir Putin as part of his campaign for global domination, said an ex-navy chief. The pair of despots look increasingly cosy on the surface - but Lord Admiral West warned that Xi could be set on seizing Russia's resource-rich territory. 6 Admiral Lord West believes Xi's long term goal could be to tear up his alliance with Putin and invade Siberia Credit: The Sun 6 He told The Sun's defence show that Putin was playing a dangerous game with Xi Credit: The Sun 6 The pair of tyrants looking cosy on their state visit last week that solidified their burgeoning alliance Speaking on The Sun's World at War show, Lord West branded Putin a submissive \"supplicant\" to a far more powerful Xi. He argued their flourishing, but not strictly defined, alliance could fall apart if the Chinese leader got too greedy. The former First Sea Lord believes Xi's long-term strategy could be to invade parts of Russia and capture its bountiful oil fields and other raw materials. He said: \"If it really gets very bad and they desperately need resources I think there's a very real risk they cold decide to take the bits of Siberia they want. \"It is all about resources. Resources are going to become more and more of a problem for China. \"They have already issued maps of Siberia that have Chinese names.\" \"That is why Putin is playing with fire. The Chinese don't like him.\" Referencing Putin's cuddly state visit to Beijing last week, he said: \"He looks like the little teddy bear about to be eaten, doesn't he? \"[That is] the danger of supping with the devil.\" Since Russia's full-scale of Ukraine over two years ago, Putin has relied on Xi as a lifeline, increasing his economic dependence on China as Western sanctions cut off access to much of the international trading system. In response to this growing trend, the former navy chief warned that the West needed to keep the pressure on Moscow with \"biting\" sanctions because that... Jerome Starkey , Iona Cleave",

She repeated a warning that Moscow first issued earlier this month after British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had a right to use weapons provided by London to hit targets inside Russia. The ex-PM also announced new British military aid for Ukraine - saying it would be up to Kyiv how it used the UK-supplied weapons. Moscow reacted with outrage as a result, citing Lord Cameron's comments as one of the reasons why it has opted to hold exercises this month to simulate the launch of tactical nuclear missiles. Raging Vlad even slammed the former PM and branded his comments as \"dangerous and worrying\". Lord Cameron said: \"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view, it is their decision about how to use these weapons. \"They're defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps.\" It prompted a fierce response from the Kremlin, with Putin's puppet spokesman Dmitry Peskov vowing his comments could \" imperil the entire system of European security architecture\".

A spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs office said in a statement that China will take action to \"resolutely crush\" any separatist plot if Taiwan pro-independence forces insist on going their own way or taking risks. China hopes Taiwan will work with the mainland to oppose independence separatism and interference from external forces, said spokesperson Chen Binhua. Early this morning, China encircled Taiwan and other Taipei-controlled islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin as part of the \"Joint Sword 2024A\" exercises. Taiwan has condemned the military drills - which are tagged as \"A\" in an apparent warning of potential follow-ups - as \"irrational provocations\". It quickly mobilised its naval, air and ground forces to \"defend the island's sovereignty,\" the defence ministry said. The defiant island has scrambled jets and even placed missile units on high alert.

Russia is said to be trying to redraw their territorial waters to steal areas in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and near the cities of Baltiysk and Zelenodradsk in the Kaliningrad region. But, experts are most concerned over Putin's plans to take over Gotland - an island that sits just off the coast of Sweden . It is thought to be the next area on Putin's hitlist if he gets his way and is regarded as one of the most important areas in the Baltic Sea.

Fuming drivers were forced to call the cops after traffic on the busy road between Menorca's capital Mahon and its third-largest town Alaoir was blocked. Authorities soon arrived at the scene in the Balearic Islands and found in a man in a \"state of drunkness\". He was taken to a nearby hospital but left after reportedly refusing to receive medical attention. He was formally identified so he could be reported to traffic chiefs and fined for putting other road users in danger. However, just a few hours later, the man was seen taking a stroll in the middle of a busy road again - causing the traffic to stop abruptly. He was then checked by ambulance staff and let go after authorities failed to find him a bed in a local accommodation centre, local media report.

The gut wrenching footage, obtained by the Daily Mail, shows the disgraced pair wearing grey tracksuits as they sit handcuffed in front of an Israeli flag. After being questioned by Israel's secret service, Shin Bet, the men spoke on the torment they unleashed with very little remorse. Radi, a father-of-seven, is a member of the Hamas Security Service, who patrolled the Nir Oz kibbutz causing chilling crimes to countless Israeli families. The thug admitted: \"In each house where we found someone, we either killed them or kidnapped them. \"In the first house I found a woman and her husband, and we hit them with fire and killed them - they were in their late 40s.\" After confessing to the murder of two innocent people, Radi spoke about how he heartlessly treated a woman he found in another home.

They were headed towards Nestryha island in Kherson region, which Russia has been seeking to control since last year. In scenes too graphic to show, the survivors of the explosion were killed by drone-dropped grenades as they scrambled onto the island. A report on the ambush stated: \"It is noted that there were several boats, on which landed more than 15 occupants.\" It added: \"The Birds of Madyar [drone unit] disrupted the operation of the Russians and eliminated at least seven Russians. \"Note that Nestryha island is the last before the mouth of the river and actually the last island on the right bank.\" As such it is strategically important \"as the positions on the island allow shelling the right-bank Kherson region with mortars and artillery\".

Nine people are seriously injured and seven people are in critical condition after what cops say was likely caused by an overload of people on the first floor. Abdoulaye Diop, 44, a Senegalese migrant living in Majorca, was the first of those who died last night to have been named. He had been working as a nightclub doorman in the area who made headlines on the island in 2017 by saving a man who was drowning. He is thought to have stopped off at Medusa Beach Club, on the beachfront promenade, after leaving the gym. The fourth victim is a 23-year-old female Spanish worker. It has now emerged nine survivors being treated in hospital are Dutch, the nationalities of the others are unknown.

Entrepreneur Fred Frost was out on a yacht during a business trip to Positano in Italy last August when he scrambled up a cliff and jumped into the waters below while wearing his Rolex Sky-Dweller. 7 Fred Frost, 27, lost his £40k Rolex but immediately replaced it 'not to look poor' Credit: Kennedy News 7 This is the moment the millionaire lost the luxury timepiece while tombstoning in Italy Credit: Kennedy News 7 Fred, who currently lives in Dubai, said he felt 'like an idiot' after losing his Rolex Credit: Kennedy News 7 The Danish millionaire said his lost luxury wristwatch was part of his £500,000 collection Credit: Kennedy News After plummeting 30ft into the water, the catch on his watch sprang open and the timepiece slipped off his wrist into the ocean below. The 27-year-old sheepishly asked a nearby fisherman how deep the water was. But after learning it was 82ft to the seabed, he conceded it was \"gone forever\". Keeping schtum to his rich pals Fred, owner of leading forex market trading company Fred Trading, put an order in for an identical watch so people wouldn't realise what an \"idiot\" he'd been. The luxury wristwatch is part of the £500,000 collection he uses as his calling card to attract wealthy \"like-minded connections\" - as other collectors \"are probably not working as plumbers or handymen\".

        "content": "The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, and water supplies are running out. Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "I write in support of Denise Tepler for Senate District 24. Denise has served admirably in the House of Representatives for eight years supporting children, families and a myriad of important issues for all of Maine citizens that includes access to health care, support for reproductive freedom, safeguarding our environment and combatting climate change. As an advocate for children and families at the Legislature in the past, I have worked to support increased investments in children and support a legislator who clearly supports children and families. Denise understands and has already shown she can deliver for us in the eight years she has served as a state representative. We will all miss Sen. Eloise Vitelli, who had to step down due to term limits, but having someone who has already proven the ability to get things done at the Legislature can give us hope for the future. Ellie Goldberg, Past and founding president of Maine Children’s Alliance, Bath Maine is facing new challenges in the years ahead as both the natural environment and the political environment change rapidly. Not only are storms stronger and more frequent as the weather becomes warmer, but the politics of the country are also becoming more partisan, more strident and less focused on a common purpose. In trying times like these, what we need in Augusta are legislators who are committed to the principles of negotiation, compromise and fairness that have been the hallmark of Maine politics since we became a state. Denise Tepler is that kind of legislator. We have watched her serve four terms in the House as the representative from Topsham, and she has learned a great deal about how state government works well in the process. She is now ready to put that knowledge to good use as the state senator from District 24, which includes all of Sagadahoc County plus Dresden, including such wonderful communities as Bath, West Bath, Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Arrowsic, Georgetown and Phippsburg. Denise is not a showy person. On the contrary, she is fairly quiet at times, even modest in outward behavior. That is good. She is not showy because she is trying to understand the issue at hand, what the facts are, what people think about the problem and what solutions are possible. She knows that in a citizen legislature no single legislator knows everything and that everyone serving there must often rely on the knowledge and expertise of other people. A vote for Denise Tepler is a vote for calm and rationality in a world that is not always calm and rational. She is just the kind of state senator we need in Augusta.

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score.

        "content": "Jason Kelce had some choice words for a troll who called his wife, Kylie Kelce, a “homemaker.” After voicing his disagreement with Harisson Butker’s controversial commencement speech , the former NFL player became the target of a troll on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Monday. “Your wife is a homemaker,” the critic wrote. “But you can’t support butker.And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television.” The netizen then accused Jason of being a “bit hypocritical,” warning he would “be left with nothing but swifties,” referencing his brother Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift. “You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame,” they concluded. The former Philadelphia Eagles player — who has three daughters , Wyatt, 4, Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 14 months, with Kylie — explained that he doesn’t view his wife as “a homemaker.” “I think of her as my wife,” the 36-year-old wrote . “I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily. The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.” Jason went on to add that the couple both raise their kids and tidy up the house. “It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks. She also makes a mean sandwich,” he joked. Start your day with Page Six Daily. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Want celebrity news as it breaks? Hooked on Housewives? “If being a homemaker, works for some, and that’s what they want, then hell yea, that’s awesome, more power to you,” the retired athlete concluded. “I want to be clear, I’m not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic.” Jason and Kylie, 31, were among some who criticized Butker for his speech at Benedictine College’s graduation ceremony in which he told the female graduates that they had been fed “diabolical lies” about how they should live their lives. “Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world,” he said. “I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabelle, would be the first to say her life truly started when she started living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.” The Kansas City Chiefs kicker also took time out in his speech to rail against Pride Month, abortion and IVF. Butker later defended his speech claiming at a fundraiser, that the backlash revealed how “timeless Catholic values are hated by many.”",

        "content": "MADRID (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war. However, Ukraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction, Zelenskyy said. “If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) airplanes wouldn’t be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Spanish capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defenses. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine’s already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia’s intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin’s army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine’s depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. “After more than two years (of war), Russia’s aggression continues, and that’s why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,” Sánchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain’s King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital’s Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighboring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine’s military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment publicly. Ukraine’s previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilized with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Zelenskyy’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "content": "@XandertheWise It depends on when the first day of school is of that year. My high school typically started very early in August, then seniors wouldn't be around anymore in May. I graduated in 2008 and during that year they pushed our first day into late August. So while my graduation was the first day of June, on Sunday, our last day of classes was the 2nd week of May. Sorry for the late reply @Bundersvessel ! I pulled a back muscle and I was in so much pain over the weekend. The joys of getting old Yeah it was an extraction. It seems to be doing rather well now.. So surreal that it's gone though. Ooooh boy I don't envy you. Mine are already all grown up thankfully (Though that comes with it's own problems). I don't think I could manage with a baby/toddler at my age now... I deal with kids enough as a teacher ha ha Is this where @kyleforrester87 is at? @JohnnyShoulder nah but I have seen that in recent years. We are total bad asses! Went to a local Tekken 8 tournament last night and it was pretty cool. I didn't do great @Voltan Cool. How many took part in that? @oliverp It was actually quite big (and a Dojo event for Tekken World Tour) - 48 players in the bracket @Jimmer-jammer How are you man? I'm still downloading RotR, despite having completed the tutorial, as I have a very slow internet connection/set up my Ps5 with performance settings that somehow cause slow downloads, anyway, it is a big game as well so that probably contributes to that. Anyway, how's work and life treating you? Is your job anything like the TV Show 'The King of Queens'? 🤣 @Black_Swordsman Doing well, thanks! Yeah, RotR is a really big game, so that’s surely a factor. As for my job, it’s less King of Queens and more Highway Thru Hell. In fact, parts of the show were filmed in my neck of the woods. I haul petroleum crude, so there’s the added stress of dealing with a dangerous goods product but the nice thing is that I work a 9 on and 5 off schedule, which works well for managing my life, especially when my real passions are decidedly less blue collar. I did, for a time, deliver and service portable toilets across Calgary and Vancouver, including at the 2010 winter olympics, which probably could have been its own tv show 😂 How are you doing? Have you carried on with your studies? Still operating the helplines? @Jimmer-jammer Yeah, good thanks, I am applying for courses at the moment so hopefully I'll get on to a good one, and yes, still operating the helplines. It's quite rewarding and enjoyable. That's interesting about your former employment. Definitely a TV Show I would have paid to watch! @Black_Swordsman Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being an ear for people in need is a real gift and takes a tremendous amount of personal fortitude. Here’s hoping your courses pan out the way you’d like! Plan a game purchase for tomorrow (its the day when the salary comes here where I live so) feel like I deserve to buy a game then (have planed the purchase for quite some time). @oliverp Which one? I cna't wait to buy Paper Mario 2, but unfortunately I had an awful pay day this month. That on top of me having spent all my savings over the last year, makes it really hard to justify new game prices. Especially since I still have quite some games left unfinished. Finances will probably return to normal by next month, so it's nothing to be worried about. Just sad that the one game I was looking forward to happened to release this month. @kidfred Oh its a big one which I might announce in the purchase thread. I of course hope that you soon will be able to pick up some new games. @oliverp I might have an idea about which game 😉 I have decided to give up on the idea of being a professional musician and focus purely on psychology for a future career path. It was an accumulation of things that led to this decision, I suppose, but mostly the fact that I realised I had been holding on to my teenage dreams, mostly inspired by reading interviews with musicians, mostly from the band 'Iced Earth' and other rock and heavy metal bands about how you go \"all in\" when you're young if you're gonna make it, and then stick to it, kinda thing. I realised that at this age a career in psychology, another of my interests, is more realistic, and on a personal level, more fulfilling to me. I also felt like I had \"made my mark\" on the music industry, with a handful of gigs from my teens under my belt, in addition to SoundCloud recordings, which people liked, flatteringly, recorded more recently. I will now just play guitar for fun, along with games, and read and watch cricket as my primary hobbies and interests, whilst focusing on psychology for the career and personal fulfillment. I have \"met up\" with my college self in the best possible way now, still focusing on a couple of the same hobbies and interests I had at that age, but without applying the passion and drive necessary to become a professional musician to that unlikely end now, and instead applying it to becoming a professional psychotherapist. @Black_Swordsman I find your decision and self-awareness quite inspiring. I'm closer to retirement than I am to my early working years, and I still don't know what I would choose to do or have a passion for. I do have some experience in psychology having spent many years talking to professionals with my personal history of depression, anxiety and other related mental illnesses, and I can certainly see the appeal and fulfillment of such a career choice. The very best of luck to you! @Malaise Thank you for your feedback and for disclosing that, I sincerely wish you all the best with your mental health and everything else in your life. I hope you discover what you want to do, in terms of a particular ambition, what you and I both referred to as a passion, and if not, I hope you enjoy the things that you do do in life that you may not necessarily be passionate about in the sense of a specific ambition, goal, or drive.",

District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case. Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 2023 after she was allegedly raped by four men , Kaivon Washington, Casen Carver, Everett Lee, and Desmond Carter. Ray is presiding over their trials, but her impartiality has been called into question after she dismissed Donald Ray Link's 1972 rape conviction this month and released rape suspect De’Aundre Cox on reduced bail last year. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III has clashed with Ray over the decisions telling WBRZ : 'I've never seen this done ever or heard of it ever done before.' Madison Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 after she was allegedly raped by four men District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions, along with her son Nelson Dan Taylor Jr's multiple rape convictions, have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case Ray's son, Nelson Dan Taylor Jr, was convicted of raping multiple classmates - aged between 12 and 17 - between 1995 and 1996, breaking into their homes in a mask and attacking them at knifepoint. He pleaded guilty to all of the rapes and was sentenced to 50 years in prison with a requirement to serve at least 25. Ray took office as a 19th Judicial District Court judge January 12, 2023. Three months later, she released De’Aundre Cox, who was accused of raping his preteen neighbor, on reduced bail without alerting the victim or notifying the district attorney's office. Cox is facing two counts of aggravated rape against a now-teenage girl who lives near his family’s home in the Park Forest neighborhood. She was 12 when the alleged sexual abuse began. She told officers that Cox threatened her with a gun before raping her on two occasions. The abuse was discovered when the victim's older brother, who was friends with Cox, found a video of the attacks on his phone. District Attorney Hillar Moore slammed Ray's decision to release him last April and said his office was only notified a week after he was released. He told The Advocate at the time: 'We really are confused as to how this bond was reduced without notice to the state and an opportunity for us to be heard on behalf of the victim. And we are concerned as to what happened and how it happened.' The victim's mother told the outlet that the family 'live in fear' and said: 'Why didn’t they let me know? We could’ve changed up, because these people have already threatened me.' This month, Ray clashed with the DA again over her decision to throw out convicted rapist Donald Ray Link's 1972 conviction for aggravated rape. Link was serving a life sentence for threatening a woman with a butcher's knife before raping her. He appeared before Ray asking her to reduce his sentence so he could ask for parole. Instead of reducing his sentence, she overturned his conviction entirely, bypassing the parole process. Moore told WBRZ her decision was 'unheard of', adding: 'She has no authority whatsoever to do what she did and her reasoning was erroneous.' Ray's decisions and her family history have raised further questions over Ray's impartiality in the ongoing Brooks case. Her decisions were slammed online with one Twitter user saying 'she needs to be removed' and another saying 'this judge should be removed! Absolutely disgusting.' Moore and Ray did not return Fox News Digital's requests for comment. LSU student Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland. After the alleged attack in their car, the suspects allegedly left Brooks stumbling and drunk on the side of a busy four-lane highway. She was hit by a car around 3am and died from her injuries. Brooks' alleged attackers claim they did not rape her and say only consensual sex happened in the back of the car. Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland Casen Carver, 18, (left) Kaivon Washington, 18, (second left) and Everett Lee, 28, (second right) and Desmond Carter, 17, (right) were all arrested on rape-related charges Brooks was last seen drunkenly stumbling out of Reggie's bar, which has since had its license revoked, with the group. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died. Fellow Varsity football player Washington has been charged with third-degree rape in Brooks' case – though prosecutors say they are hoping to upgrade the charges. He has been accused of raping another young woman who claims he attacked her in October last year after targeting her at Reggie’s, the same bar the group met Brooks. The victim in the October case says she was too drunk to go home so asked if she could stay at one of Washington's friend's apartments. According to his arrest affidavit, they all went back to the home together, where she and the friend started having sex in front of Washington. The friend allegedly became more 'aggressive', pinning her down and ignoring her as she pleaded with him to 'stop'. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died The 29-second clip shows Madi appearing to tell the teenager Desmond Carter, 17, to 'get out' of the car so she can 'Uber on her own' Washington was watching but then approached and felt the victim's breast and vagina, the affidavit claims. The alleged incident is the third accusation of rape to have been made against Washington. In addition to Brooks, he is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in 2020 after following her home from a pool party when he was 15. The Walker High School Varsity Football player has been charged with first-degree rape in that case, with prosecutors vowing to upgrade the charges in relation to Brooks. Lawyers for Washington previously submitted video footage to the court in an attempt to prove that the drunk sorority girl was able to consent to the acts – but a judge felt it showed 'criminality'. A legal expert told DailyMail.com that the judge's 'inappropriate' comments could 'taint the public opinion' of the defendants. Washington can reportedly be heard in the footage laughing at Brooks as she slurs her words after the alleged anal rape. Her sorority Alpha Phi confirmed that she donated her kidneys and heart Madi died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men who had picked her up at a college bar Louisiana's first-degree rape statute carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. Brooks died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men. Two Good Samaritans reportedly stopped to perform CPR on the sophomore LSU student after the collision. East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office says they were guided by first responders on the phone in the pouring rain after Madi was hit by the ride-share car. They confirmed that Madi Brooks died from 'multiple traumatic injuries' when she was hit by a car after allegedly being raped. Police confirmed that the driver of the vehicle will not be charged as he was not impaired and contacted emergency services immediately. A memorial was created for the 'amazing young woman' who had 'limitless potential' by her friends on the highway where she died. Carter has been formally charged with the first-degree rape and third-degree rape of Madi, but a grand jury chose not to indict him on one count of kidnapping Madison Brooks (left) seen behind the bar at Reggie's with two sorority sisters. She had been drinking at the bar before she was raped and fatally struck by a car on January 14 Pictures show Washington partying with friends and posing for the camera, while another shows him topless and clutching an inflatable alien The bar where Madi worked, according to several social media posts, has also had its responsibility for the incident called into question. Surveillance footage surrounding Reggie's bar, where the group met, shows Madi drunk and stumbling around, according to police documents. The Louisiana ATC has confirmed that they have suspended the license of Reggie's following the 'seriousness of the allegations and potential threat to public safety'. An attorney for the bar, Kris Perrett, confirmed in a statement that they are 'fully cooperating with authorities'. A lawyer for Brooks' family issued a statement last year saying: 'She was raped. Rape is rape. It's just a horrific, terrible situation. 'And to the extent that those involved with the alleged rapist want to blame the victim and show up at press conferences and say things ... we're standing up for Madi. That's not right.'

        "content": "by: iSeeCars Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT ( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) Compare Dealer Financing with Outside Financing There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Negotiate Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Beware of Add-Ons Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Understand the Terms of Your Loan Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. Make Payments on Time It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. Should I Refinance My Current Loan? If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Bottom Line Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "Some of the polls before the general election may be overstating Labour’s huge lead over the Conservatives , a Tory election expert has said. According to Robert Hayward, a peer and former MP who first identified the phenomenon of “shy Tories” before the 1992 election, his analysis of local election results suggests that the Conservatives are getting more support from voters who say they are undecided than is showing up in the polls. “About 33 years on, I am yet again convinced that a statistical bias exists in the polls,” he said. Polling in the run-up to the election has shown commanding leads for Labour of more than 20 points in some surveys, such as YouGov, while others, such as Opinium, show a gap of about 14. Some constituency-level polling by YouGov suggests the Conservatives are heading for near wipeout. Its April projection points to more than 400 seats out of 650 going to Labour . Most experts, MPs and political strategists across the parties agree that Labour is almost certainly heading for victory, but the size of its lead will determine its majority in parliament. Hayward said it was “not shy Tories” all over again, and that Labour still undoubtedly had a large lead over the Conservatives, but he was concerned the polls were “getting it wrong”. “I think the biggest problem for me is how you allocate the Conservative 2019 voters who are now ‘don’t knows’. I do believe the ‘don’t knows’ will vote in fairly large numbers, and the indications from local council results is that they are beginning to break towards the Conservatives. “Because of the lack of commitment displayed so far, I’m not sure where things are going to end up, because events during this election could have more of an effect than in many elections because there are so many undecided.” One polling industry expert also agreed there was a risk the polls could contain methodological or structural errors. They said: “I think there are lots of reasons to be concerned about a polling error this time around. There are serious data quality issues across the industry, where it’s getting tougher to ensure the people taking part in surveys are real, taking the surveys seriously, and representative of the wider population. Pollsters are working harder to combat it, but that task is getting tougher, and there is a risk that it affects the accuracy of the polls this election. “The other issue is undecided voters. There’s three times more people who voted Conservative and are undecided than voted Labour and are undecided, and where these voters end up going will make a big difference. The pollsters make different assumptions about this group ... The range of this is probably like Labour 1997 to Canada 1993 – it’s a Conservative party historic defeat with one methodology, to complete wipeout with another methodology.” Sign up to Election Edition Make sense of the election campaign with Archie Bland's daily 5pm briefing, direct to your inbox. Jokes where available after newsletter promotion They added: “The last thing is that polls do tend to be less accurate in elections with lots of change. Polls were fairly inaccurate in 1997 but it didn’t matter, because the result was so decisive. When there are more voters moving between parties, polls become more chaotic, their accuracy tends to decrease.” Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, said it was likely that the differences between each company’s surveys would narrow as polling day approached. “There are still a substantial number of people who voted Tory in 2019 saying ‘Don’t know’ when asked how they will vote,” he said. “A large amount of the difference in leads between different polling companies is because of different choices in how to handle that. Some companies choose to model or predict how those people will vote come election day, while others report only what people currently say. “It is as much a philosophical decision as anything else. Are we measuring how people say they will vote, or predicting how we think they will vote? Either way, it is reasonable expectation that the differences between pollsters will narrow in the lead-up to July 4 as the number of people saying ‘Don’t know’ falls. However, whether that results in a narrowing lead or not depends on to what extent, if at all, those voters return to the Tory party.”",

        "description": "If you want to combine a motorcycle road trip with a camping adventure, then you will need a quality tent. Here are five of the best to consider.",
        "content": "We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. With camping gaining popularity, it might have you wanting to take your motorcycle out into the wilderness to see what all the fuss is about. Motorcycle camping isn't exactly the same as going into a campground with your truck pulling a camper, or even car camping. You have to be far more picky about what you bring along with you, and that means you'll usually be going without a camping gadgets and portable grills that you could take car camping. There are many different tents out there, and some of the cooler ones have a garage-like space for your motorcycle to be tucked away out of the elements. If you don't want to spend for the extra quality of life upgrades like that, you can stick with a smaller tent that will keep you safe and dry overnight. No matter the case, there are plenty of options available, and each one on this list is backed up by high user scores. A more in-depth explanation of how these five tents were picked can be found at the end of the list. If you're looking for something that can keep your motorcycle dry overnight, the Wolf Walker tent is a perfect option for you. For $215.99 from Amazon, you get a tent that'll let you camp out overnight while also providing a cover for your motorcycle. You might think having a spot for a motorcycle would take up a lot of the room, but you still have room for two or three people with the motorcycle. However, it would get cramped fast if you're all trying to fit air mattresses in there. It comes bundled with a storage bag that lets it get all packed up and tucked away on your bike when you're all done. This tent has a 4.4 out of five user score on Amazon based on more than 140 ratings. While it's advertised as being waterproof with a rainfly for cover, some reviewers have noted water soaks through the liner and gets the floor wet. Other reviewers mention it being a good tent during storms, so your mileage will vary. A cheap, no-frills tent that will keep you inside overnight is exactly what the Coleman Sundome tent offers. It's available from Amazon for $68.78, and its easy 10-minute setup makes it a breeze to make your campsite. There's no fancy way to keep your motorcycle housed inside as this is meant for two people, but you can opt for bigger sizes if you have more people with you. Coleman recommends the tent for backpacking and hiking, With more than 20,000 ratings on Amazon, this Coleman tent has a 4.7 out of five rating. There's nothing particularly fancy about the tent, but it's affordable and easy to carry around, which makes it a solid option for somebody camping out with their motorcycle. If all you're looking for is a way to stay dry overnight while having a roof over your head, it's hard to beat this tent for the price. It comes with a carrying bag so when you're all done with the tent you can get it packed away and back on the road within minutes. The poles fold up nicely, so you won't have issues storing it away nicely on a motorcycle. While not exactly a traditional tent, the Outsunny folding camping cot get you elevated off the ground and give you housing that'll keep you dry from any potential rain. This is an option for solo bikers who don't want or need to set up a whole tent. The cot comes with an air mattress and a dome covering for $124.99 from Amazon, where it has a 4.2 out of five user score. It seems like quite a bit to pack away, and everything weighs 27.1 pounds, making it heavier than some of the other options on the list. Some reviewers note it's too wide to stow away on a bike, but others mention how it was fine for road tripping on a motorcycle, so perhaps you'll need to measure the dimensions of your motorcycle beforehand. With this being more of a raised bed, you do have the downsides of not having a ton of storage space. If you're looking for a simple way to sleep overnight and get going again in the morning, then this is a good choice for you. If you want to have additional room outside of just a bed, you'd want to go with a regular tent instead. For a lightweight option at just about 2 pounds, the Hubba Hubba 2-person tent is a perfect choice if you're not trying to lug around something heavy. Cutting back on the pounds comes at a premium of $549.95 at retail, but you can often find the tent on sale well below that. On Amazon, you can grab it for $299, and it's much easier to justify at that price. It's a small tent that's mean for just a couple of people, but you have some nice storage options where you can put your phone and keys. Don't expect to be able to stand up in this tent, but there are 40 inches of headspace that lets you still move around without being too uncomfortable. The user scores are nice at 4.5 out of five on Amazon. There are some negative reviews where the tent broke or ripped on them after the first use, so that's a potential issue you could run into. With this being a high-priced tent, that'd be a shame, especially since there's no type of warranty offered with the purchase. If you didn't know Harley-Davidson made outdoor gear , you likely had no idea the company made tents. The Harley Road Ready Tent boasts the brand's iconic black, orange, and gray colors and comes in at a lightweight 5 pounds. The size makes it perfect for taking on a road trip, and you can fit it into the trunk of your Harley or luggage rack with ease. It comes in at $179 from Harley-Davidson, so while it's not the cheapest tent from the list, it's also not the most expensive. It can house up to three people and comes with a duffle bag that makes it easy to transport. The tent has a 4.56 out of five rating on Harley-Davidson's website, where customers speak highly of its quality. In a one-star review of the Harley tent, a buyer argued the rain fly isn't large enough, and that's the only complaint from the user scores. This is a good one for Harley fans who want to show off their brand loyalty. The tent is backed by a 90-day limited warranty. All five of the tents on this list have high user scores from where they're sold, whether that's Amazon, or in the case of one tent from Harley-Davidson. Motorcycle camping differs from regular camping as you don't have the room a car can provide, so you need to save space where you can. Each of these tents fits into a little bag that makes it easy to carry with a motorcycle. On top of that, nothing's too heavy where you'll feel like you're being weighed down while riding in a noticeable way. With many motorcyclists traveling on their own, each tent is made for a person or two, so you won't have a lot of extra space. That's not a huge deal if you're just looking for somewhere to spend overnight, but don't expect to pack a full family comfortably into any of these five options.",

        "description": "\"That is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin.\"",
        "content": "According to Sky F1 correspondent Craig Slater, dropping Esteban Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix is “under serious consideration” for Alpine boss Bruno Famin after the events of Monaco. Ocon had launched an overtake attempt on Alpine team-mate Pierre Gasly into Portier on the opening lap of the race, but the duo would collide, lifting the rear of Ocon’s Alpine off the ground as he suffered race-ending damage. This did not go down well at all with team principal Famin, who in the immediate aftermath, threatened “consequences” for Ocon via French broadcaster Canal+, which sparked speculation that Ocon could be benched for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix, where he is due to serve a five-place grid drop. Slater has moved to confirm that this is a genuine threat facing Ocon, rather than just a rumour that emerged in the heat of the moment. “Bruno Famin, he was actually on the pit wall with Canal+ who called him up immediately in the aftermath of that first-lap crash and Famin spoke angrily and he talked about taking a tough decision, which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada,” Slater began. “What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin. He will do what is best for the team. But if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be, he is prepared to do that, but that decision has yet to be taken. “There were face-to-face meetings between Ocon and Famin in the aftermath of the Grand Prix yesterday. Ocon apologised, both privately face to face and publicly afterwards via social media. So let’s see what happens.” 👉 Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash 👉 Monaco GP data: Mercedes ‘survival’ strategy conditioned by Alonso’s traffic denies fight for the win Gasly did go on to secure a point in P10, moving Alpine’s total up to two in what has been a disappointing season for the team so far, these struggles having seen both Gasly and Ocon linked with moves away from the team for F1 2025. Williams has been speculated as a potential destination for Gasly, while Ocon has been linked with the likes of Haas and Sauber, to become Audi in 2026. And Slater reckons that this Monaco incident – and any repercussions that it may carry for Ocon – fuels such exit talk. “I think what it does do is call into question whether Ocon will continue with the team beyond next year,” Slater continued. “We all cast up the fact that he was a childhood rival of the other Alpine driver Pierre Gasly and could the two happily coexist in the same team? Well, this is another example of them not coexisting happily. “And the other thing is, as far as most observers were concerned, it was a needlessly optimistic attempt that Ocon made to pass. “It could have cost the team any points in the Grand Prix, it could have taken both the drivers out the race and with the situation as it is at the moment, with anyone outside the top five teams really struggling to get points, it could have left them again at the back of the Constructors’ standings. “In the end, Gasly was able to get a point, that keeps them on two points for the season, but that’s an illustration of just how costly that crash could be. “So we wait and see. I think it would be a big, big decision to drop someone like Esteban Ocon. It really rarely happens. You don’t see it happen. “And remember, not that he’s unavailable to race, he has a five-place grid penalty for Canada, that would carry on to whoever got in that seat, of course. “But it is, as I understand it today, still a potential outcome here.

Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that Roshni Helpline's emergency service 1138 will be linked with the KMC's helpline so that we can work together in this regard. He said that the KMC will raise awareness among the public about missing children so that innocent children are not used for begging. The Mayor said that wherever there are no manhole covers in the city, the work of installing them is underway and will be expedited so that children do not fall into them and get or killed. Dr. said that Roshni Helpline is an institution that has been working for a long time to prevent child abduction. The role of parents is extremely important in preventing child, especially for children under the age of 18, he said.

        "content": "Devon’s planned devolution deal with Torbay has been thrown into limbo because of the surprise announcement of the general election. Devon and Torbay’s councils had both agreed to create a combined county authority (CCA), a so-called devolution deal that proponents believe would provide a better chance of securing government cash for projects linked to adult education, housing, transport, and green initiatives. But prime minister Rishi Sunak’s plans for a poll on Thursday 4 July mean parliament will be dissolved next week, putting many planned pieces of legislation on ice. Before the election was announced, it was hoped the parliamentary process would take place in or around October, but with uncertainty about who will be running the country then, it’s now unclear what will happen. “We are seeking clarity from government officials on how the legislative process for setting up the Devon and Torbay Combined County Authority will be affected following the announcement of the general election,” Cllr James McInnes (Conservative, Hatherleigh & Chagford), the new leader of Devon County Council said. “We met....with Torbay Council and both organisations remain committed to bringing forward our agreed devolution arrangement as soon as possible, and we collectively await clarity from government officials.” Cllr McInnes added that he had already contacted the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing, which oversees the devolution process, to secure the previously announced £16 million agreed as part of the deal. He and Torbay’s leader, Cllr David Thomas (Conservative, Preston), have selected 16 “excellent projects” to receive the money, a decision that now needs to be confirmed by a formal vote. “These schemes span housing, skills, business support and green infrastructure and can have an immediate impact on our local economy,” Cllr McInnes added. “There would be schemes in each district area with the potential to bring forward affordable homes, decarbonise existing properties, support more than 1,000 learners in green and net zero skills, and the creation of jobs and apprenticeships.” Cllr McInnes added that as soon as he had any more information about the devolution process, he would update the council.",

        "content": "Caitlín and Ríoghán The friends of a Co Armagh woman who was diagnosed with cancer while pregnant with her son have launched a fundraiser to help the young mum as she begins treatment. Caitlín McAlinden, 24, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma when she was seven months pregnant . Now that her little boy Ríoghán has arrived into the world, Caitlín will be starting her treatment within the next couple of weeks. Since being diagnosed, Caitlín has had to put a pause on her teaching career, which she \"loved so much\". She is now having to manage being a new mum and her cancer diagnosis , with no permanent job in place.

        "content": "Couch co-op and JRPG are two genres you don't often see together. Secret of Mana is one of the earliest examples of the genre, with most of the Tales of series also allowing fans to play together while sitting side-by-side. But outside of those examples, playing JRPGs with your friends in the same room isn't a common experience. Fortunately, Timesea Studio — made up of three brothers — is changing that. Nintendo Life can exclusively reveal that the developer's first game, Infinity Knights: Xross , is coming to Switch (and other platforms) in late 2025. It's a three-player couch co-op RPG inspired by the Mana series, first and foremost. But it's clear that the trio behind the title — Saxon, Michael, and Tyrone Goodrick — have a wealth of knowledge about the genre. Dark Cloud , infamously called the \"Zelda Killer\" by PlayStation Magazine back in the day, and the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI (which is still going after 22 years) are both name-dropped. Plus, the brothers have managed to make \"a dream come true\" and have brought Secret and Trials of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta on board. Infinity Knights: Xross is centred around the titular Infinity Knights, who serve the king. They wield The Armaments, magical weapons with the power to revive the dead — including, enemies you've just slain. You'll be playing as Xross, the newest Infinity Knight, and you and two others (this is where that co-op comes in) will get to explore the world, scout static and randomly generated dungeons, engage in a huge variety of minigames and quests and plenty of active combat with puzzles to solve. And like any good RPG harking back to the SNES days, there's some lovely pixel art on show, too. We had a chance to send Timesea Studio a bunch of questions and dig deep into the game's inspirations, mechanics, and world. From working together as brothers to implementing quests from an MMORPG, and making quality-of-life enhancements inspired by childhood frustrations, this is clearly a labour of love. Nintendo Life: Could you tell us a little bit about how you came up with the idea for Infinity Knights: Xross, particularly around creating a couch co-op RPG and working together as siblings? Michael Goodrick, Lead Boss Design & Area/Experience Development: We always knew one day we would make a game. We have all these ideas swirling around – ideas about quality of life, intriguing stories, and engaging gameplay. As RPGs are one of our favourite genres, and with old-school games being close to our hearts, we decided to make Infinity Knights: Xross pay homage to that. But specifically making it cooperative comes from a long-shared passion of playing video games – we’ve played in the same house together since we were kids. It was never really a question. Working together on a video game was just the next step! we’ve played in the same house together since we were kids. It was never really a question. Saxon Goodrick – Lead Programmer & Story/Event Planner: We also noticed that there is a distinct lack of good cooperative experiences in the gaming world. We wanted to fill that gap by creating a game together, as some of our fondest memories are playing games in the same room, on the same couch. Games like Secret of Mana, Crash Bash , Halo 3 , etc. Tyrone Goodrick – Lead Combat Design & Minigame Design: Being brothers makes working together on the game easy. When it comes to discussing ideas, mechanics, bosses, and stories, we are all on the same wavelength. New ideas are usually met with a \"That's awesome!\" Working together as siblings is a blast and a lot of fun. We’ve got game titles with Cross, or with X (sometimes pronounced cross, sometimes the letter 'X'). So why 'Xross'? Saxon: There are quite a few reasons. Infinity Knights is a collection of stories experienced from the viewpoints of certain characters. This game is the first story, and it features the titular character ‘Xross’, hence, Infinity Knights: Xross. Using the ‘X’ instead of the ‘C’ in ‘Xross’ is very symbolic concerning the story. The name is... regionally unique. It’s a different dialect compared to most other names in this chapter of Infinity Knights. Xross himself is also an integral part of the Infinity Knights – he is a very significant person. ‘X’ marks the spot, as they say. It’s also an ode to many things. To Final Fantasy XI, to the Organization XIII members in Kingdom Hearts , and X ( Mega Man X ) to name a few. Infinity Knights: Xross is the cumulative influence of gaming generations combined with our own new and unique ideas. An intersection of two directions. A cross! You’ve been inspired by a range of classic (and sometimes overlooked) RPGs, with Dark Cloud, the Mana series, and Final Fantasy XI singled out. What is it about these games/franchises that struck you, and what inspirations have you taken from them? We’d say that the strong point of those games is deep immersion. Each game brought something new to the table that hadn’t been seen in a game before – at least to us. They still feel like fresh experiences that haven’t been replicated since. We love questions like this because we could talk about these games for hours. Infinity Knights: Xross is the cumulative influence of gaming generations combined with our own new and unique ideas. Dark Cloud is so unique in its worldbuilding and atmosphere. The combination of dungeon diving, slaying monsters, and building up the towns via Georama ... the whole experience is fantastic. It’s got an unusual (brilliant) soundtrack, fun drawings, and a wicked weapon customisation/progression system. Great game. We’re combining this weapon system with some inspiration from Final Fantasy XI’s ‘ Trial of the Magians ’ system, allowing players to customise their stats and abilities present on both weapons and abilities. Xross also looks after a sector of the Kingdom as part of his Infinity Knight duties, and we have been inspired by elements of the Georama system. In Dark Cloud, you would explore dungeons and use Atlamillia to rebuild a town before moving on to help others. We take a similar approach, where on adventures you collect all kinds of things on the overworld and dungeons before bringing them back to bolster shops, equipment, sector resources, and so on. Ultimately, it helps your character's progression and the story. Final Fantasy XI has this incredible sense of adventure and wonder. It really captures immersion well. It’s the kind of game where you can just run around the world map for hours, talking to NPCs, discovering secret areas, and fighting cool enemies. We have loads of memories in Vana’diel. Those who’ve played the game know the feeling. We wanted adventures outside our kingdom sector to hit home in a similar way. In Infinity Knights: Xross, you team up and venture out to undiscovered lands, secret areas leading to dungeons, and tough enemies to fight. That sort of thing. We’re also structuring part of the character progression in the same way [as] job classes in Final Fantasy XI. Some sharp-eyed fans have noticed that you wield a variety of different weapons – and these sort of act like job classes. Each weapon comes with a set of abilities unique to it that augment the way you fight when combined with the elements you’re harnessing. Secret of Mana was ahead of its time for RPG console co-ops. You could play the whole game together, or you could drop in and drop out! How awesome! Co-op experiences are a lot of fun, and we were inspired by Secret of Mana from a young age. It’s also got an awesome soundtrack. We’re very encouraged by the co-op legacy that Secret of Mana left, and that’s especially evident in a later Mana release on the Nintendo DS called Children of Mana . A lot of inspiration is taken from these games in the way that pixel and sprite games can be just as enjoyable, sometimes even more so than AAA games. There is a lot to be said for the immersive qualities of a top-down sprite J/RPG. We think that these games have effectively constructed this immersive feeling through their unique graphics, story content, gameplay systems, and sound. It’s a delicate balance to create experiences like these games do. That’s what’s inspired us. We want to create an amazing experience for gamers through every medium we can. Engaging gameplay, great scenes and story, fun... and we’re going to do it cooperatively too. What kind of modern qualities of life have you considered for Xross? Are they inspired by any frustrations you’ve had when playing and replaying older JRPGs? Michael: This is an excellent question and something we are very passionate about. We’ve kept a list for a long time regarding the features we would love to have seen in the games we’ve played — JRPGs and other genres — and it is a BIG list. As such, many quality-of-life features have made their way into our game, and will continue to do so. Some of these already exist, but a lot are unique! Secret of Mana was ahead of its time for RPG console co-ops Tyrone: Things like accessibility for disabilities, being able to customise the UI, and rearranging things. It amazes us that many games do not allow you to customise button inputs. No drop rates that don’t respect players’ interest or time. Making sure cutscenes are skippable and tutorials are optional and non-repetitive. Preset modes for speedrunning and randomization. The list goes on. We’re keeping a lot of our unique features a secret, but hopefully, these can get you into our mindset of how we’re enabling players to enjoy themselves most. There are a few things we’re willing to share now though. Saxon: We’re developing an automatic reaction timer (that can be turned on or off). If the game senses you need a bit more time to parry correctly, then it will adjust to challenge you appropriately. We’re hoping that features like this will encourage people to try some of the more challenging mechanics in video games, as well as increase the immersion felt by players. We’re also looking at changing the way ‘difficulty’ works in this game, so that the experience is more customised for your enjoyment, instead of just having preset modes with scaled stats, etc. You’ll be able to combine different levels of ‘difficulty’ for yourself, granting the best experience for you. We could go on to list more features, but what really matters is our intention. We want to make a game that respects players’ time and doesn’t feature punishing statistics, missables, penalties, and so on. We have every intention to make sure players enjoy their time in the world of the Infinity Knights. You can be sure that we will try our utmost to reduce all frustrations players have to zero through a lot of personal playthroughs, testing, and player feedback. We want to make one of the most accessible and playable RPGs of all time. What can you tell us about the Armament System? How does it affect combat and gameplay, and can you give us examples of side quests that involve this mechanic? Saxon: The Armament System is the Infinity Knights’ bread and butter, and we can split that into two sections: gameplay and story. The Armament System is our weapon upgrade system. You can select enhancements you’d like to apply to the weapons you want to wield, strengthening them as you use them more. This will also augment your abilities. You can also combine them with elements! You might like a giant scythe with a hefty chance to teleport and deal double damage, or maybe you’re more of an archer who likes to use magic lightning arrows that bind opponents while reducing your ability cooldowns. We want players to know they can use whatever weapon they want combined with many different enhancements, which will drastically change the way each individual plays the game. We want to make a game that respects players’ time Michael: In addition to that, if you and your allies combine attacks, you ALL get the enhancements from each other. We’re hoping that by blending these abilities cooperatively, you’ll create a truly unique strategy for taking down foes. It’ll be something just you and your cooperators share. We have lots of mechanics that promote teaming up with your allies, be it CPUs, friends, or family. Saxon: The Armaments themselves are summonable weapons that the King bestows on his Infinity Knights. They’re strange blades that only the King can create, and every day, he performs a ceremony called ‘The King’s Rite’ that seems to revive anyone slain by an Armament... The Infinity Knights rely heavily on this, using the weapons on themselves or allies to save themselves in the heat of combat, traversing another realm to be called back to the Kingdom. The Infinity Knights also use the Armaments on their enemies, isolating foes within the Kingdom at the discretion of the King’s power. Almost all quests involve the mechanics of the Armaments, and many of them will provoke players into questioning the morality of the blades' power, of what is right and what is wrong. How are the Armaments made? Do they have a cost? Should they be used on the guilty? The innocent? Why does only the King have them? Are there others? As a brief example, there is a quest where Xross throws himself off a cliff in pursuit of an enemy, by using his Armament on himself before he plummets to his death. We’re really trying not to spoil the game, but we’re hoping that the people who read this can start to imagine what they might do if they could cheat death for themselves and others, and how that might change depending on the type of immortality a person has. Through this avenue, we can engage those who love the story, morality, and philosophy behind some of the great RPGs of the past. Hiroki Kikuta has worked on a few notable indie titles such as Indivisible , YIIK , and Tangledeep . What’s it been like working with Kikuta-san, and what do you love about his music? Michael: It has been like... a dream come true. If you told us 20 years ago that we’d be working with Kikuta-san, it would have left us gobsmacked. Kikuta-san is an incredible artist - his passion, experience, and musical talent we just have so much respect for. If you told us 20 years ago that we’d be working with Kikuta-san, it would have left us gobsmacked. Tyrone: He is a legendary composer that made a massive impact on how a game's sound can be. We feel that while the story, characters, and visuals are a massive part of a game, the music direction is equally as important. Many games wouldn't be what they are today without the talents of their respective composers and we believe Secret of Mana (among others) is one such game. Kikuta-san creates songs that can transport you into that world. He manages to capture the atmosphere of the moment - running around, fighting a dangerous boss, saying farewell, etc. You can listen to the soundtrack decades later and remember your own feelings playing that game, something he has achieved time and again. The main track for Infinity Knights: Xross – ‘Going to the Eternal’ – is a great example of how he took the story and the questions it poses, and transformed it into a song. Incredible. Also. We love Kikuta’s drum tracks and beats, they’re so good. We’re amazed by him, to put it simply, and we’re very much looking forward to all our future work together. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. Thank you to Saxon, Michael, and Tyrone for taking the time to answer our questions. Infinity Knights: Xross is set to release in late 2025 on Switch, and you can find even more details about the game on its official website . So....would that be “ex-ross” (and if so who is Ross?) or just “cross”? 🤣 Or would be pronounced like “zross”? And if it is just “cross” then what’s with the “x”? Inquiring minds want to know..... Will it have blackjack and hookers?",

        "content": "When it comes to summer fashion trends, there are somethings that are here for just the season and others that will be around for years to come. Timeless white linen sun dresses will always be fashionable, but there is one dress in particular that is taking Instagram by storm right now. Fashion fans are going wild for Marks and Spencer's Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift Dress and we can definitely see why. For one, it looks so much more expensive than its modest £39.50 price tag. In fact, it resembles a £434 version from the designer label, Wolf and Badger. The cami-style shift dress, which previously sold out online, is guaranteed to be a staple in any spring and summer wardrobe for years to come, thanks to its timeless design and effortlessly elegant construction. It has been cut in a regular fit with a n elegant and floaty midi skirt that's flattering on any figure. READ MORE: New Look shoppers 'bin' jeans for £20 skirt that makes legs and bums 'look amazing' READ MORE: New Look's 'summer dress of dreams' cheaper than £35 M&S style that completely sold out The £39.50 number, which comes in petite, regular and tall lengths, as well as in sizes eight to 24, is crafted from a breathable pure cotton poplin that's comfortable to wear even on the warmest days, whether in the UK or on holiday abroad. Plus, the zipper makes getting the dress on and off a breeze. The simple yet stylish and versatile design means it can be styled in a myriad of ways. It can be worn to formal events with heels or a blazer or with a pair of wedges, sandals or trainers on less dressier occasions. We especially like these £22.50 Flat Open Toe Mules and the £55 Leather Double Buckle Flatform Sandals. At Marks and Spencer, the Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift Dress has racked up over 70 five-star reviews from happy shoppers. One customer said: \"Good fit, lovely fabric, can dress up for work or down for a day at the beach. Lovely.\" Marks and Spencer's Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift Dress comes in at £39.50 (Image: Marks and Spencer) A second wrote: \"This dress looks far more expensive than it is. The cut and shape is perfect and very flattering.\" A third penned: \"Very pretty dress, fitted bodice and very flattering skirt both in fullness and length, just need an excuse to wear it now.\" \"Beautiful dress,\" mentioned another. \"Simple style but looks the part. Versatile can dress up for the evening. Fantastic price.\" Another glowing review read: \"Don't even think about it, order it now. Absolutely lovely, on trend and will suit everyone young and old. Refreshingly simple and crisp and can be worn with so many things, pumps or kitten heels.\" However, one person gave the Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift Dress a three-star review because it wasn't what they expected. They wrote: \"Returned as not what I was expecting. Bodice was very tight.\" The Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift is highly-rated with over 70 five-star reviews (Image: Marks and Spencer) But another loved their latest M&S purchase, adding: \"Absolutely gorgeous dress, I love it. Beautiful fabric, falls nicely and feels very expensive but actually it wasn't. It comes with a size zip which is great, I can't wait to wear this dress.\" Elsewhere, shoppers can pick up the Dropped Waist Racer Neck Midi Dress in cream by the brand 4th & Reckless for £45 at ASOS. At River Island, the Cream Linen Blend Skater Midi Dress is available for £35.",

Discover why BlockDAG is the top choice for crypto investment in 2024The post BlockDAG Announces New Dashboard Features: A Comparison with DogWiFhat Price and Theta Network Prediction appeared first on Metaverse Post.",
        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. The gamification of cryptocurrency is changing how investors interact with digital assets. ‘s latest dashboard feature is a prime example of this trend, offering a gamified experience that engages users. This article will compare BlockDAG with Dogwifhat Price and Theta Network Prediction, highlighting their similarities, differences, and unique selling points. It also aims to provide useful and interesting content to generate excitement about BlockDAG’s mineable network and encourage readers to consider investing in the presale. Theta Fuel (TFUEL), the Theta Network’s operational token, is essential to on-chain processes like deploying smart contracts and compensating relayers for sharing video streams. Analysts and investors often discuss the potential for TFUEL to hit $1. Although it is currently undervalued, a number of factors could affect its price in the future. Technological developments, general market trends in the cryptocurrency industry, and the Theta Network’s overall growth and adoption are all significant factors. The market for TFUEL is anticipated to grow as Theta Network broadens its alliances and applications. Innovations in blockchain technology and the growing popularity of decentralised streaming services also contribute to the increase in its potential value. Reaching the $1 threshold is a difficult but attainable goal, though it takes significant market momentum and positive sentiment to do so. DogWiFhat, although not very well-known, has seen its price rise sharply due to significant investments by large players known as ‘whales’. These big investors have been buying substantial amounts, causing a noticeable increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. This activity has sparked curiosity in the crypto community, with many speculating about the reasons behind these large transactions. Whale activity has given DogWiFhat’s price a brief boost, but overall, the price has been extremely volatile. This has caught the eye of retail investors, who see it as a possible investment opportunity. However, opinions among analysts are mixed. Some believe the whale activity signals confidence in DogWiFhat’s potential, while others warn that the price surge may be short-lived and driven by speculative trading rather than real value. BlockDAG’s latest dashboard feature offers users comprehensive insights and tools to manage their investments. Upon entering the dashboard, users see the latest announcements, ensuring they’re always informed. The dashboard also displays the user’s current rank, wallet balance, and recent transactions, making it easy to track investment progress. The leaderboard showcases the top 30 users with the highest purchases, categorised into Crab, Tortoise, Fish, Shark, and Whale ranks. This gamified ranking system adds competition and motivation for users to increase their investments. The referral screen allows users to see the bonuses earned through their referral links, enhancing the community aspect of BlockDAG. BlockDAG’s platform is built on advanced low-code/no-code technology, simplifying the creation of utility tokens, meme tokens, and NFTs. Users can choose from pre-designed templates and customise them to meet their needs. This intuitive interface democratises access to blockchain technology, allowing individuals and businesses to explore and create on the blockchain. By accelerating development timelines and reducing time to market, BlockDAG fosters a vibrant ecosystem of diverse projects. The platform’s robust and scalable infrastructure supports the growth of decentralised applications, enriching the blockchain landscape with innovation and diversity. Each platform showcases distinct strengths and promising prospects when considering BlockDAG, DogWiFhat, and Theta Network. DogWiFhat has garnered attention due to its substantial whale activity, while Theta Network’s expansion relies on its broadening range of applications and technological advancements. Nevertheless, BlockDAG shines through its innovative dashboard feature and user-friendly interface, making it an appealing option for potential investors. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its user-friendly dashboard, gamified ranking system, and easy-to-use token creation tools, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the crypto industry. By delivering a seamless and captivating user experience, BlockDAG is well-positioned to attract substantial interest and investment. As the crypto market continues to expand, BlockDAG’s progress ensures it remains a key player, offering unmatched opportunities for investors. For those seeking to invest in the next groundbreaking innovation, BlockDAG’s mineable network presents a promising prospect.

United bosses have made the rising star one of their main targets in this summer's transfer window. The 21-year-old has established himself as one of the best young defenders in the , and has been included in initial squad ahead of the .

Everton will demand around £80m for Branthwaite, while United value him closer to the £60m mark. Ratcliffe has completed a review of United's recent transfer activity since taking charge of football operations in January. The billionaire believes United have grossly overpaid on several occasions - and is determined not to fall into the same trap when it comes to Branthwaite. He knows cash-strapped Everton are desperate to raise funds this summer, and fears the Merseysiders will look to exploit United's wealth. But Ratcliffe is not prepared to pay over the odds, and will look elsewhere if no deal can be struck with Everton. United want to bring in a top class replacement for Raphael Varane, who left the club following last weekend's FA Cup final win over . While there are also doubts about the long-term futures of defenders Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. Alternative targets include England and star Marc Guehi, Juventus defender Gleison Bremer and ace Levi Colwill. Branthwaite, who is under contract with Everton until 2027, was recently voted his club's Players' Player and Supporters' Young Player of the Season.",

        "description": "Biologist warns of potential environmental impacts of this practice on local sensitive habitat",
        "content": "Tanja Hespe Kerr moved to Royston about 25 years ago. Over the years, she has observed from her front porch, which overlooks Comox Harbour, a trend she says has been worsening. “People drive down the beach, park wherever they want and set up their lawn chairs,” she said. “Sometimes they have fires going and some let their dogs run free. They can stay there for several hours.” “It has been getting worse, especially in the summertime, (and it seems like) the place is getting more popular.” Accessing the intertidal zone via the community’s boat launch on Marine Drive, steps from Royston Road, Hespe Kerr explained that vehicles typically enter the beach at low tide and leave when the tide rises. Though she mentioned that the majority of people are using the boat launch for its intended purpose, the Royston resident is concerned about those using it improperly. On more than one occasion, she observed up to six vehicles driving and parking all over the beach, littering the ground, and becoming mired in the mud as they tried to leave. “One time, a woman got... stuck so badly that the tide came in (and engulfed her car,)” said Hespe Kerr. “It was kind of laughable because her dog was swimming in circles around the vehicle while she was standing beside the car with her coffee cup trying to scoop water out of the inside of her vehicle.” Despite efforts from locals, law enforcement, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to prevent vehicle access to the beach, this illegal practice, in violation of the federal Fisheries Act, persists to this day. “Around five years ago, DFO put up a sign saying ‘Launch and retrieve ramp only. Do not park on the beach,’” said Hespe Kerr. “That sign was taken down in less than 10 days. As soon as it was put up, people were still driving on the beach.” At her wit’s end, the nature enthusiast and avid kayaker took to social media to share her discontent with the current situation. Shortly after, Area A Director Daniel Arbour commented on Hespe Kerr’s post. In a May 23 interview with the , Arbour shared that he would address this matter in an upcoming regional district meeting. “I think there’s a lot of value to (this boat launch), but I think that what was not anticipated is people using it to go for random drives around the beach,” said Arbour. “That is definitely not the kind of thing that we want to encourage.” “It’s also not in my intent (to close off the boat launch.) We want to make sure that people continue to have amenities but have respect for the marine environment.” The local politician also added that he is currently in discussions with regional district staff to find ways to prevent motorists from accessing Royston’s intertidal zone. “We’re going to start by laying out our options and strategies,” said Abour. “(We also want to) engage the community and see what’s (needed) to improve the management of that boat launch.” Although this practice seems to be localized to Royston, as Arbour noticed, registered biologist Dusty Silvester said the damage done by motor vehicles to this small area cannot be neglected. “(Any) additional impacts beyond the baseline are just going to push things a little bit further towards an unbalancing (of the ecosystem),” said Silvester. “If there’s an introduction of a deleterious substance by way of access to the intertidal zone, that’s gonna have an impact not only on that specific location where it occurred but on the broader landscape.” Any pollutant or contaminant, whether introduced willingly or accidentally – such as gasoline, motor oil, or invasive species –could cause harm to this ecosystem, which happens to be a sensitive habitat. “Royston, and other parts of the Comox harbour, are identified (as) red-listed communities which is a provincial regulatory item (which recognizes) that specific areas need to have special management practices put in place to protect (them) and (mitigate negative) impacts. “These sensitive ecosystems are (called) ‘sensitive’ because they’ve already been subject to the impact of human development and urbanization. Adding these extra impacts to a location (that was) somewhat stable, (might cause its loss.)” Potentially affecting everything from aquatic plants to mollusks, fish, birds, and mammals, the biologist highlighted that driving one’s vehicle in this sensitive habitat could have a ripple effect on the region’s broader food web. The impacts could be significant, including ground compaction that could asphyxiate shellfish, the crushing of crustaceans that are food for local birds, and the disruption of herring spawning grounds and smelt feeding areas, which support other aquatic species. Extending beyond the Comox Harbour, Silvester also expressed concerns about the effects of deleterious substances carried by south-flowing currents to the Baynes Sound, another highly ecologically and biologically sensitive area. “That area in particular is well known for being an intertidal agriculture area for the shellfish leases,” Silvester noted. “Would you wanna eat oysters that were exposed to motor oil or gas? Probably not. “I’m sure that (the shellfish industry) have practices in place to protect their harvest... but ultimately (I’m) sure they would want to keep these deleterious substances out of that area.” In a May 23 statement to the , DFO stated that they are taking proactive steps to address the current situation. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada is aware of the issue of off-road vehicle activity in several intertidal foreshores around the Comox Valley and of potential impacts to in-channel and riparian fish habitats associated with this activity,” reads the statement. Additionally, the governmental institution mentioned collaborating with the province to find a long-term solution for managing vehicle access and protecting fish habitats in the Comox Valley area. Under the federal , it is considered a violation to operate a motor vehicle on intertidal flats (section 34.4) and harmfully impact fish habitats (section 35). If the operator of a vehicle is found guilty of an offence under either of the two sections, they are liable for a fine ranging from $15,000 to $100,000. Members of the public are asked to report observations of illegal off-road activity to the DFO Observe Record Report line at DFO.ORR-ONS.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-465-4336.",

        "description": "Man United have identified four players who are not for sale any under any circumstances this summer - but their list should be longer.",
        "content": "Manchester United's players had not even made their way out onto the sun-soaked Wembley pitch and Lisandro Martinez was already making his presence felt. As Erik ten Hag and Pep Guardiola got the nod to lead out their teams behind the match officials, Martinez screamed at the top of his voice in an attempt to rally his teammates. His scream was loud enough to force the young mascot next to him to cover his left ear. Martinez was making just his second start since overcoming a muscle injury and United's supporters were hopeful his last dance with Raphael Varane at centre-back would boost their chances of an unlikely FA Cup triumph. It was the first time they had started alongside each other since February 1. READ MORE: United considering keeping Erik ten Hag as manager READ MORE: INEOS respond to fears United could be banned from Europa League next season While United's 13th FA Cup crown will always be remembered for the goals from academy graduates Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo , Martinez's role in contributing to such an impressive triumph should not be dismissed. He played a starring role at the back, managing 73 minutes on what was just his fifth start this calendar year. The Argentine was restricted to just 14 appearances in all competitions this season because of injury issues, robbing United and Ten Hag of one of the most important figures in the squad. He was immense in his first season at Old Trafford, silencing critics in the process, and United missed him far too often this term. Providing an unrivalled level of passion for the game, Martinez wears his heart on his sleeve, producing the commitment and desire United fans expect as a bare minimum. As he said in a post-match interview with MUTV, United's players \"need to die for this badge\". Martinez's mentality ranks as one of the very best in the squad. Few can admit they are as passionate and motivated as he is when they cross the white line. While there is no doubting the importance of having the right mentality, Martinez is also fortunate enough to be an excellent player at the same time. His presence in the heart of United's back four at Wembley gave Ten Hag's side a completely different dimension, with the Argentine capable of stepping up with the ball, playing aggressive, forward-thinking passes and giving United an improved level of control. \"Lisandro Martinez is [one of the] top five centre-backs in the world,\" City boss Guardiola said in a post-match interview . \"He made the difference on this game by playing passes through our defence.\" Lisandro Martinez is a vitally important figure for Manchester United. (Image: Justin Setterfield - The FA/The FA via Getty Images.) Compliments do not come much bigger. Martinez's passing ability was a trait United missed far too often this season. Last term, he regularly linked up with Luke Shaw on the left side of the defence and they progressed the ball with purpose in the first phase of the build-up play. What's more, United's defensive record has been poor this season without Martinez being an almost ever-present figure. He played a key role in helping the club record 28 clean sheets in all competitions last season, whereas this term they kept just 13. United are planning to make big changes to the landscape of their centre-back department this summer and have already made the decision to let Varane go. Jonny Evans is out of contract, meaning he could follow suit, while one of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof is expected to be sold. United need to recruit a new first-choice partner for Martinez for him to bond with and form the bedrock of the team. Yet the club, surprisingly, has not included the Argentine on its list of players who have been deemed untouchable ahead of this summer's transfer window. As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, it is understood the club will entertain offers for everyone but Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund , Mainoo and Garnacho. Martinez should be added to that list, as should captain Bruno Fernandes, who also played a starring role at Wembley. Martinez, who faced a barrage of questions about his height when he arrived in England almost two years ago, has been one of United's biggest success stories in the transfer market in the last few years. His injury record this season, of course, has put the brakes on his progress, but his importance to this team is unquestionable. Next season, United will be praying he does not encounter the same level of bad luck he has experienced this term. First, though, they need to add him to their list of untouchables.",

        "description": "Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has been in need of a win after the embarrassing collapse of her controversial Reading Cinema deal, and it seems she may have found one with a new high-flying advisory group. The mayor’s new team of leaders from the retail, hospitality, tech, property development and creative sectors will advise her directly as the capital undergoes major redevelopment — while reeling from public sector cuts and the rising cost of living. It’s a group that includes proven experience from the likes of Willis Bond’s Mark McGuinness and Primeproperty’s Eyal Aharoni, alongside fresher faces like Yu Mei handbag designer Jessie Wong and Brooke Roberts from online investment platform Sharesies. Whanau has said it’s important to her “that our local businesses have an active role in shaping and delivering the transformation of our city”. For a hand-picked team of business advisers, the mayor has done well. But even more important than her selection is the fact she’s realised she needs to be working closer with those on the frontline. Those who have chosen and still choose Wellington to make a living. Those who call the capital home. Last month Whanau suffered an embarrassing blow when Wellington City Council officials decided to finally end negotiations with Reading International over a controversial deal to reopen the closed cinema complex on Courtenay Place. The council had planned to buy the land under the cinema for $32 million, money which the cinema would use to redevelop the building. It was a deal blasted by some as nothing more than corporate welfare and raised questions about how much the global company really cared about Wellington if it wouldn’t carry out the necessary strengthening work itself. But even in the face of its toughest critics, Whanau championed the deal as a game-changer for the central city. For a mayor under fire for failing to read the room when it comes to dishing out ratepayer money to help one international company, her new move shows she’s ready to listen and learn. The mayor has signalled an announcement will be coming soon in relation to the plan to remove cars from the Golden Mile. This has already seen Cranfields, a business that has operated in Wellington for 33 years, decide to shut up shop. Whanau has said the project is transformational change. “It will create a beautiful, pedestrian-friendly CBD that will attract people, workers and shoppers. It will make our buses more reliable.

        "description": "Biologist warns of potential environmental impacts of this practice on local sensitive habitat",
        "content": "Tanja Hespe Kerr moved to Royston about 25 years ago. Over the years, she has observed from her front porch, which overlooks Comox Harbour, a trend she says has been worsening. “People drive down the beach, park wherever they want and set up their lawn chairs,” she said. “Sometimes they have fires going and some let their dogs run free. They can stay there for several hours.” “It has been getting worse, especially in the summertime, (and it seems like) the place is getting more popular.” Accessing the intertidal zone via the community’s boat launch on Marine Drive, steps from Royston Road, Hespe Kerr explained that vehicles typically enter the beach at low tide and leave when the tide rises. Though she mentioned that the majority of people are using the boat launch for its intended purpose, the Royston resident is concerned about those using it improperly. On more than one occasion, she observed up to six vehicles driving and parking all over the beach, littering the ground, and becoming mired in the mud as they tried to leave. “One time, a woman got... stuck so badly that the tide came in (and engulfed her car,)” said Hespe Kerr. “It was kind of laughable because her dog was swimming in circles around the vehicle while she was standing beside the car with her coffee cup trying to scoop water out of the inside of her vehicle.” Despite efforts from locals, law enforcement, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to prevent vehicle access to the beach, this illegal practice, in violation of the federal Fisheries Act, persists to this day. “Around five years ago, DFO put up a sign saying ‘Launch and retrieve ramp only. Do not park on the beach,’” said Hespe Kerr. “That sign was taken down in less than 10 days. As soon as it was put up, people were still driving on the beach.” At her wit’s end, the nature enthusiast and avid kayaker took to social media to share her discontent with the current situation. Shortly after, Area A Director Daniel Arbour commented on Hespe Kerr’s post. In a May 23 interview with the Record , Arbour shared that he would address this matter in an upcoming regional district meeting. “I think there’s a lot of value to (this boat launch), but I think that what was not anticipated is people using it to go for random drives around the beach,” said Arbour. “That is definitely not the kind of thing that we want to encourage.” “It’s also not in my intent (to close off the boat launch.) We want to make sure that people continue to have amenities but have respect for the marine environment.” The local politician also added that he is currently in discussions with regional district staff to find ways to prevent motorists from accessing Royston’s intertidal zone. “We’re going to start by laying out our options and strategies,” said Abour. “(We also want to) engage the community and see what’s (needed) to improve the management of that boat launch.” The environmental impacts Although this practice seems to be localized to Royston, as Arbour noticed, registered biologist Dusty Silvester said the damage done by motor vehicles to this small area cannot be neglected. “(Any) additional impacts beyond the baseline are just going to push things a little bit further towards an unbalancing (of the ecosystem),” said Silvester. “If there’s an introduction of a deleterious substance by way of access to the intertidal zone, that’s gonna have an impact not only on that specific location where it occurred but on the broader landscape.” Any pollutant or contaminant, whether introduced willingly or accidentally – such as gasoline, motor oil, or invasive species –could cause harm to this ecosystem, which happens to be a sensitive habitat. “Royston, and other parts of the Comox harbour, are identified (as) red-listed communities which is a provincial regulatory item (which recognizes) that specific areas need to have special management practices put in place to protect (them) and (mitigate negative) impacts. “These sensitive ecosystems are (called) ‘sensitive’ because they’ve already been subject to the impact of human development and urbanization. Adding these extra impacts to a location (that was) somewhat stable, (might cause its loss.)” Potentially affecting everything from aquatic plants to mollusks, fish, birds, and mammals, the biologist highlighted that driving one’s vehicle in this sensitive habitat could have a ripple effect on the region’s broader food web. The impacts could be significant, including ground compaction that could asphyxiate shellfish, the crushing of crustaceans that are food for local birds, and the disruption of herring spawning grounds and smelt feeding areas, which support other aquatic species. Extending beyond the Comox Harbour, Silvester also expressed concerns about the effects of deleterious substances carried by south-flowing currents to the Baynes Sound, another highly ecologically and biologically sensitive area. “That area in particular is well known for being an intertidal agriculture area for the shellfish leases,” Silvester noted. “Would you wanna eat oysters that were exposed to motor oil or gas? Probably not. “I’m sure that (the shellfish industry) have practices in place to protect their harvest... but ultimately (I’m) sure they would want to keep these deleterious substances out of that area.” DFO’s stance In a May 23 statement to the Record , DFO stated that they are taking proactive steps to address the current situation. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada is aware of the issue of off-road vehicle activity in several intertidal foreshores around the Comox Valley and of potential impacts to in-channel and riparian fish habitats associated with this activity,” reads the statement. Additionally, the governmental institution mentioned collaborating with the province to find a long-term solution for managing vehicle access and protecting fish habitats in the Comox Valley area. Under the federal Fisheries Act , it is considered a violation to operate a motor vehicle on intertidal flats (section 34.4) and harmfully impact fish habitats (section 35). If the operator of a vehicle is found guilty of an offence under either of the two sections, they are liable for a fine ranging from $15,000 to $100,000. Members of the public are asked to report observations of illegal off-road activity to the DFO Observe Record Report line at DFO.ORR-ONS.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-465-4336.

To ensure food security for the nation's growing population, it's essential to effectively manage damage and infections through Primary Plant Protection (PPP) measures. Crop protection chemicals, including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, are pivotal in preventing crop contamination, which not only reduces grain yield but also degrades quality. The agricultural technology landscape is advancing swiftly, with innovations such as telematics, autonomous vehicles, and crop protection making notable strides. Restraints: Rising environmental concerns related to petrol-oil based adjuvants Concerns are mounting regarding the impact of herbicides and their accompanying adjuvants on non-target species due to their excessive usage. These adjuvants are not only dispersed on the intended target plants but also spread across the entire agricultural field. Consequently, the environmental repercussions stemming from the combined application of adjuvants with fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides have led to regulatory restrictions. Moreover, as spray adjuvants drift into neighboring areas due to wind dispersal, each application contributes to air pollution. The overuse of pesticides poses a significant environmental threat, which acts as a barrier to market growth. Opportunities: Rapidly growing demand for green adjuvants Environmental impact assessments indicate that green adjuvants, when utilized alongside crop protection chemicals, have minimal negative impacts on both humans and the environment. These adjuvants not only enhance the effectiveness of active ingredients in crop protection chemicals but also prioritize human safety. The growing emphasis on the nutritional value of products among urban residents, driven by increased personal incomes and affordability, has sparked a surge in demand for organic food items. This increased awareness directly impacts the agricultural adjuvants market, driving the demand for green adjuvants.

        "description": "An economic impact assessment report on the proposed federal emissions cap framework.",
        "content": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An economic impact assessment report completed by S&P Global Commodity Insights for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producer (CAPP) shows that a scenario where a stringent 40% emissions cap is applied from 2030 could lead to significant cuts in domestic conventional oil and natural gas production, reaching a one million barrel of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) reduction by 2030 relative to the reference case. A mandated stringent 55% emission cap by 2035 would result in a reduction of two million boe/d in 2035 compared to the reference case. Conversely, the assessment shows that the conventional industry could deliver $1.3 trillion in GDP contributions and support 383,000 Canadian jobs annually by 2035 with just an 8 percent increase in production if it were permitted to add drilling and export infrastructure under current policy frameworks. CAPP commissioned the assessment to better understand the potential economic implications of different production scenarios, including one where a fixed emissions cap is imposed upon the sector. The report only focused on the impact on conventional production and did not include oil sands production. The S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis explored three alternative production scenarios under parameters requested by CAPP for the conventional oil and natural gas sector to 2035. The Reference Case forecasts conventional oil and natural gas production under current policy conditions. The Stress Case forecasts production under a stringent 40% emissions cap mandated for 2030. The High Case forecasts production with the assumption of additional investment into export and production infrastructure. The Reference Case forecasts that under current policy conditions conventional oil and natural gas production could reach six million boe/d by 2030 and remain near that level to 2035. In comparison, the Stress Case shows that a mandated 40% emission reduction by 2030, relative to 2021, could lead to one million boe/d lower production in 2030 and a two million boe/d reduction by with a mandated 55% reduction by 2035. According to the economic assessment: The Stress Case results in total $75 billion lower upstream investment spend across the 2024 to 2035 period compared to the Reference Case. This would result in $247 billion lower GDP contribution between 2024 and 2035 compared to the Reference Case. The Conventional oil and natural gas sector could support an average of 347,000 jobs annually under the Reference Case. The Stress Case has 51,000 fewer jobs supported annually across Canada. The report also explored scenarios with higher economic benefit to Canada. Both the Reference and High Case scenarios show production can grow while the investments in decarbonization leads to lowering emission intensity. The High Case shows that 8% growth in conventional oil and natural gas production, compared to the Reference Case out to 2035, would support an additional 36,000 jobs annually across Canada and over $100 billion in additional GDP contributions to 2035 with debottlenecking of existing pipeline and LNG export capacity. Compared to the Stress Case, the High Case scenario shows an additional $125 billion in investment from the conventional sector, $351 billion in cumulative GDP contributions, and 87,000 more jobs supported annually out to 2035. The report can be found on CAPP’s website. Quotes from CAPP President & CEO Lisa Baiton “The proposed emission cap framework for the oil and natural gas sector is unnecessary and should not proceed. Under existing proven policy measures the conventional oil and natural gas sector is growing production while lowering emissions. Instead, Canada should give the policies in place time to work while collaborating with industry and provinces on pragmatic solutions to deliver emissions reductions in the short term while positioning Canada and our energy industry for long-term success.” “The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is forecasting Canada’s per capita GDP will perform the worst out of all its 38 member nations for the next 40 years. To change the direction of our economy we need to support growth in our largest job creators. The S&P Global Commodity Insights report shows the conventional oil and natural gas sector holds significant potential for even greater contributions to the Canadian economy through thousands of new jobs, billions in revenues to governments and over a trillion dollars in GDP over the next 12 years.” “Declines in production forced on the industry by a stringent emissions cap will result in significant job losses for Canadians, severe impacts on the economy and our GDP, and have the potential to compromise Canada’s energy security and prosperity. Canada has a choice. We can discourage growth in one of the country’s largest industries and pursue aggressive climate policy at the highest cost to Canadians, or we can encourage growth and prosperity while still delivering emissions intensities reductions.” “Instead of supporting emissions reduction in upstream operations, a new cap and trade system adds costs and uncertainty, which stifles investment and will force producers to curtail production to reach compliance. Lower Canadian oil and natural gas production does nothing to curb global demand growth and will have no impact on global emissions. The loss of Canadian oil and natural gas exports will be made up by other nations, who may not share Canada’s high environmental and emissions standards.” “Both the Reference and High Case conventional oil and gas production forecasts would contribute to over $1 trillion in cumulative GDP and support up to 383,000 jobs annually out to 2035. CAPP believes this is a conservative estimate of Canada’s growth potential given the country has one of the largest undeveloped resource bases in the world.” About CAPP The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) is a non-partisan, research-based industry association that advocates on behalf of our member companies, large and small, that explore for, develop, and produce oil and natural gas throughout Canada. Our associate members provide a wide range of services that support the upstream industry. CAPP’s members produce nearly three quarters of Canada’s annual oil and natural gas production and provide approximately 450,000 direct and indirect jobs in nearly all regions of Canada. According to the most recently published data, the industry contributes over $70 billion to Canada’s GDP, as well as $45 billion in taxes and royalties to governments across the country. CAPP is a solution-oriented partner and works with all levels of government to ensure a thriving Canadian oil and natural gas industry. We strive to meet the need for safe, reliable, affordable, and responsibly produced energy, for Canada and the world. We are proud to amplify industry efforts to reduce GHG emissions from oil and gas production and support Indigenous participation and prosperity.",

        "description": "Joe Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, was set to play Division I baseball at Winthrop University after playing two years of junior college ball. But he decommitted after a coaching change at Winthrop.",
        "content": "ROCHESTER — Due to a coaching change at Winthrop University, Joe Sperry has had a change of heart. Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, has spent the last two seasons as a standout for the University of South Carolina Lancaster junior college baseball team. He had planned to play at Division I Winthrop starting this fall, but decided to decommit when the head coach was fired following the 2024 season. “I don’t know who the (new) coach is going to be,” Sperry said. “The staff that recruited me to go there, or at least the coach, isn’t there anymore. So I think I should just find a new relationship with a coach at a different school. I had the option to do that so I chose to do that.” Sperry had to get a release from Winthrop after signing a letter of intent before he could begin the recruitment process again. “They gave me an opportunity to be successful, and I’m grateful for that,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The right-handed hitting and throwing Sperry was a two-way player at Lancaster. He had a monster hitting season this year as a sophomore. He batted .398 with a lofty 1.264 OPS. He smashed 20 home runs, had 16 doubles, scored 56 runs and had a whopping 84 RBIs in just 54 games. On the mound, the 6-foot-2, 210-pounder went 3-4 with a 6.67 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 54 innings. His fastball topped out at 93 miles per hour and was regularly in the 88-92 range. He has already had some preliminary talks with coaches at other Division I schools, but is still early in the process. He would like to make his decision as soon as possible, but doesn’t want to rush it. “There could be a lot coming up here soon,” he said. “When you reopen your recruitment, it’s just crazy for the first couple of days. You don’t know who’s going to be talking to you or who’s interested.” Sperry is done with the school year and has returned home. He is training at The Yard Sports Training facility in Rochester. He is taking a little break from baseball but will play with the Rochester Honkers of the Northwoods League beginning July 3. “That’s still the same plan for the summer,” he said. “But who knows, I might have to take some time off with the Honkers in order to visit a school or something. But I’m sure they’ll understand that. But hopefully, I’ll find a new home by then.” — — Four area seniors have been selected to play in the Minnesota High School All-Star Baseball Series. The event will be held June 20-22 at Chaska Athletic Park. ADVERTISEMENT The event will feature six teams and each team will play a pair of games. Local seniors who will participate for the South squad include Isaiah Brennan of Byron, Preston Ohm of Zumbrota-Mazeppa, Reid Hartmann of Red Wing and Isaac Nelsen of Lyle/Austin Pacelli. — — Rochester Community and Technical College had six baseball players named MCAC South All-Division for the 2024 spring season. The Yellowjackets finished the season 29-17 and were one of the final four teams in the North Plains District Tournament. Yellowjackets coach Clark Jones was named the South Division Coach of the Year for guiding RCTC to a division title and a 14-2 record. Named to the first team were infielder Griffin Olson of Viroqua, Wis., catcher Augusto Mungarrieta of Valencia-Carabobo, Venezuela, and outfielder Luis Rodriguez of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Rees Campanale of Orlanda, Fla., was named to the second team as a pitcher and the third team as a designated hitter. Others named to the third team were pitcher Jerry Santiago Jr. of Coamo, Puerto Rico, and outfielder Ramon Teran of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Guy N. Limbeck is a sports writer for the Post Bulletin.

        "description": "Minnesota has a new point person working with the state's Fortune 500 companies, educating them about NIL, all in search of the next 'game changer.'",
        "content": "Imagine a day when Gophers athletes are receiving millions of dollars in name, image and likeness (NIL) payments from Minnesota's big businesses, putting them on par with peers across major college sports. The Gophers are hoping for their own version of what the University of Memphis landed in April with a $25 million NIL contribution from FedEx. Why not dream big on getting an NIL supercharge from among the state's 15 Fortune 500 companies? \"FedEx is a game-changer,\" Gophers athletics director Mark Coyle said. \"There's no doubt.\" Brett Schreiner is the new point person trying to help Coyle and the Gophers attract a big-business NIL investment like the one Tigers athletics scored from the Memphis-based shipping giant. Schreiner was fundraising on the university's academic side before taking on his new role as Senior Manager, Business Development-NIL. He works for Learfield, the official rights holder for the Gophers and hundreds of other collegiate programs. The Gophers were the 13th program within Learfield's national footprint to hire someone for an NIL-specific job. \"We're trying to kind of be on the cutting edge with this role,\" Schreiner said. \"We're trying to work with a lot of companies to make NIL more important to them.\" Schreiner, who played Division III football at Wisconsin-Eau Claire and worked in athletics at his alma mater and Wisconsin-Stout, is trying to change the way big companies think of NIL in Minnesota. The most familiar NIL path involves donations to a collective, such as Dinkytown Athletes , which helps athletes get paid through endorsements. A challenge facing collectives is trying to explain to larger businesses how they can benefit from this process. Why should Minnesota's Fortune 500 companies, such as 3M, Target, Best Buy, Land O'Lakes and General Mills, invest in NIL deals with Gophers athletes? Many of these corporations already donate to the U in other areas. In 2017, 3M announced a 14-year, $11.2 million Gophers athletics naming rights sponsorship with the Mariucci hockey arena. NIL is completely different, but the Gophers have talked to 3M about giving. \"3M and the University of Minnesota have had a strong relationship for nearly 100 years and our involvement in Gopher Athletics is one piece of a larger partnership,\" 3M spokesman Mike Laninga said. \"The Gopher athletic department was very helpful in explaining how the NIL process works and how to properly engage if we chose to do so.\" Schreiner works closely with Jeremiah Carter, Gophers senior associate AD for NIL/Policy and Risk Management . Schreiner explained that a crucial step to convincing corporations to invest in NIL is getting them to see the value of influencer marketing. Using social media and video messaging, athletes can use their personal brand and social media following to bring exposure to companies big and small. \"I don't think this path has gotten as much press,\" Schreiner said. \"This basically gives student-athletes a chance to be influencer marketers for companies. That can mean a lot of different things. This can also teach athletes about developing their entrepreneurship and what they want their brand to be.\" Sure, Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns or the Vikings' Justin Jefferson are popping up on billboards and ads all over town. Could Gophers athletes be in the running for similar opportunities? A recent example was Gophers women's basketball leading scorer Mara Braun's image being used on a billboard in town to promote Affinity Plus, a Minneapolis credit union. Braun has nearly 28,000 followers on Instagram. \"How can we pair a company with student-athletes and the Gophers' brand to touch the hearts of fans across the state and the nation?\" Schreiner said. \"We can humanize the companies with athletes from the University of Minnesota and not just from the local pro sports teams.\" U.S. companies went from investing an estimated $1.7 billion in influencer marketing in 2016 to $16.4 billion in 2022, according to data from influencermarketinghub.com . Other data from the site projects that investments in influencer marketing by businesses nationally could increase to $24 billion this year. In late February, state legislation stripped the NCAA's ability to regulate NIL in recruiting, opening doors for collectives to negotiate directly with prospects before they signed. That changed NIL in a big way. An agreement Thursday between the NCAA and Power Five conferences opened the door for direct payments to athletes -- another massive-change moment for college sports. This points toward Minnesota and other schools taking control of the NIL process, which would make Schreiner's goal of connecting large companies to NIL funding even more critical for the Gophers. \"It's part of the growth and evolution we will need as an athletics department to best position us for the future,\" Carter said. \"A position like Brett's is going to be relevant and needed no matter where NIL goes.\"",

Strengthening optimism that the European Central Bank, which meets on June 6, could make positive moves towards a rate cut have also buoyed stocks and oil prices. The governor of the Bank of Finland, Olli Rehn, who is also the European Central Bank (ECG) governor, helped matters on Monday by suggesting that rate cuts could begin in June because inflation was closing in on its 2% target across the euro zone and that the drop in inflation was “sustained”. “Thanks to this disinflationary process, inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,” Rehn said . “This obviously assumes that the disinflationary trend will continue and there will be no further setbacks in the geopolitical situation and energy prices,” he added. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} For April, Euro zone inflation was 2.4%, the seventh consecutive month in which it remained below 3%, with May figures due out on Friday this week expected to be highly anticipated by markets.

        "description": "Lincoln City Libraries announced the top three books competing for the annual Memorial Day “One Book One Lincoln” competition on Monday morning.",
        "content": "Lincoln City Libraries hosted coffee fanatics and book lovers at The Mill Coffee & Tea's Telegraph District location Monday morning to announce the top three books competing for the annual “One Book One Lincoln” competition. “ The Berry Pickers ” by Amanda Peters, “ A Little Devil in America ” by Hanif Abdurraqib and “ North Woods ” by Daniel Mason are the three left to vie for the top title. The three books come from the 71 titles nominated by community members, which a committee of 15 members narrowed to 10, then three. Now, community members are encouraged to vote for their favorite until Aug. 31, and the winner will be the top featured book in the 2024 reading program. \"We look forward to receiving votes throughout the summer and learning which book our community selects as their One Book One Lincoln shared community read,” said Ryan Wieber, Lincoln City Libraries director. Allysa Diehl. Allysa Diehl, the chairperson of the One Book One Lincoln committee, said there is something for everyone within these three books. “I really think there's just nice variety in the top three,” she said. “Lots of different stories, but really great writing.” \"The Berry Pickers\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. “The Berry Pickers,” a debut novel written by Amanda Peters, is a national bestseller, 2023 Barnes and Noble Discover Prize Winner and winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. The book takes readers through the nearly 50-year-old unsolved mystery of a missing 4-year-old girl from the blueberry fields of Maine. Hanif Abdurraqib’s essay collection, “A Little Devil in America,” is the first collection to be featured in the One Book One Lincoln competition. The collection is a finalist for the National Book Award and Pen/Diamonstein-Spielvogel award, winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal and the Gordon Burn Prize, and one of the top ten Best Books of the Year, according to the Chicago Tribune, The Philadelphia Inquirer and more. \"A Little Devil in America\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. Diehl said some committee members paused their reading to research certain parts of the story, learning about multiple generations through stories of different centuries, all encompassed in one book. “North Woods” by Daniel Mason is the story of a house in the New England woods, told by the many inhabitants who have lived there over many centuries. The book is a National Bestseller, a New York Times and Washington Post top ten Book of the Year, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and one of the Best Books of the Year, according to Time, NPR, The Boston Globe and more. \"North Woods\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. All three books are available in print, audio and e-book formats and can be borrowed from the library through its catalog . This event has been held annually since 2002, letting Lancaster County residents connect through reading the same books and discussing them together. “What we're looking for are books that have good writing and opportunities for lively discussion,” Diehl said. Community members are invited to begin nominating books for next year's competition. “The goal is that it'll give us something to talk about all across the city,” Diehl said.

        "description": "It doesn't have to take a lot of resources to distinguish yourself in a crowded tech market. What it does take is a truly innovative idea, customer focus, a compelling story, and working with people who complement your strengths.",
        "content": "I've spent the bulk of my career in the tech startup world. In the late 1990s I developed the security software Snort and then launched the security software Sourcefire , which was later acquired by Cisco. Currently, I'm the CEO of another security startup called Netography. I also serve as a board member of several other cybersecurity tech startups. Over the years, I have been repeatedly in a position of thinking about what it takes for startups to stand out amid market noise, category confusion, and louder voices from companies with more resources. Here are five suggestions that have helped tech startups find their niche and differentiate themselves . As soon as a new technology starts to capture attention, the market gets flooded with companies trying to capitalize on it. But I have found that the seed for innovation often comes from examining why things are the way that they are, not chasing trends. For example, why does network security only exist in on-premises networks and not in cloud networks? As it happens, the tools we built 25 years ago for securing networks are not effective on modern networks. Since 89 percent of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy this is a problem--and presents an opportunity to architect a vastly more effective approach to network security. Don't fall into the \"if you build it, they will come\" mentality. Innovation alone isn't sufficient; it needs to be proven, with actual users. Before you invest heavily in building the solution, validate your idea with your target audience. Run your idea by potential customers, ask for feedback, and truly listen. If possible, get your solution in their hands so you can learn from actual user experiences. It's better to know upfront if you are really onto something, or if you need to pivot before you sink time and money into execution to the exclusion of a better idea. You have multiple audiences you need to \"sell\" your solution to, including customers, investors, employees, and partners. You need a compelling overarching story that includes the current state of the market, the challenge, the opportunity, and how your company addresses the challenge in a new and more effective way. Simplify the technical and, when you can, relate your approach to something these audiences are likely to be familiar with so that the story will resonate. Everything is fair game--pop culture, consumer products, and daily life. In cybersecurity, I've seen successful parallels drawn from spy movies, self-driving cars, and even cooking and cattle ranching. I've been lucky enough to benefit from relationships with industry and business mentors. Mentors on the industry side have a deep understanding of the technology area you are focused on, an informed perspective on how the industry has evolved and where it is going, brutal honesty when they foresee potential challenges on the horizon and creativity to help you think about how to approach and solve problems. Mentors on the business side serve as great examples of how to be an effective manager and leader, which includes recognizing the talent you have in the organization and staying focused on the mission--building a great company. The experience they bring having worked successfully with investors, lawyers, and strategic partners can help you avoid costly mistakes. Recognize where you lack experience and surround yourself with people who complement your strengths and who you can watch and learn from. When times are tough, as they were during the dot-com bust and are today amidst current macroeconomic conditions, the flip side is that many great talents become available. Your company may be in a position to benefit. Scrutinize your needs and see if there's an opportunity to bring in the right people to fill the gaps you have. Standing out in a crowded tech environment will always be challenging, particularly for startups with limited resources. To find your niche, start with a truly innovative idea, validate it with customers, tell a story that resonates, and surround yourself with the right people to help you build a great company.",

        "content": "( WAVY ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "The ‘‘Cyber Surakshit Bharat’ initiative of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) was conceptualised with the mission to spread awareness about cyber-crime and build capacities of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and frontline IT officials, across all government departments, for ensuring adequate safety measures to combat the growing menace of cyber crime and enable organizations to defend their digital infrastructures and become future-ready in tackling cyber-attacks. National e-Governance Division (NeGD), under its Capacity Building scheme, organised the 44 th CISO Deep-Dive training programme from May 27–31, 2024 with participants from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and New Delhi at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi. The inaugural session of the programme was attended by senior officials from MeitY, NeGD & IIPA. The deep-dive training specifically aims at educating and enabling CISOs to understand cyber-attacks comprehensively and thoroughly, get necessary exposure in latest technologies of safeguard, and translate the benefits of a resilient e-infrastructure to individual organizations and citizens at large. The training is also focused on providing a holistic view of legal provisions, enabling CISOs to formulate policies in the domain of cyber security and build concrete cyber crisis management plans. The purpose of the programme is to spread awareness, build capacities as well as enable Government departments to take steps to create a cyber resilient eco system. The endeavour of the programme is to sensitise and orient participants on cyber safety and security, thus facilitating the Digital India programme for integrated delivery of various Government services to citizens. It also imparts holistic information and knowledge about cyber security to enable government departments to look after their cyber hygiene, safety and security.

        "content": "Madam Dorcas Atia, the Talensi District Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), has called on Ghanaians to be reminded of the democratic gains of the country and safeguard it to protect the prevailing peace. That, she said, would ensure prosperity and stability not only in Ghana but also in the sub-region for sustainable and human-centred development. The Director made the call when she addressed stakeholders, including political parties, traditional leaders, religious leaders, security agencies, leaders of persons with disabilities, and youth groups, at an Inter-Party Dialogue Committee (IPDC) meeting held in Talensi District of the Upper East Region. The meeting was organised by the NCCE under the auspices of the European Union-sponsored project dubbed “Preventing and Containing Violent Extremism (PCVE) in the Northern Regions of Ghana”. It is aimed at creating awareness about violent extremism and facilitating activities to engender security consciousness, social inclusiveness, community cohesion, and situational awareness among the citizenry to enhance peacebuilding for sustainable development. Madam Atia noted that the challenges posed by violent extremism were complex and multifaceted, and it was therefore imperative that stakeholders worked together collaboratively across all agencies to monitor and report on threats and vulnerabilities. “NCCE believes that by sharing information and best practices, we can enhance our ability to detect early warning signs and take proactive measures to prevent violent extremism in this district,” she stated. She said, “we aim to pave the way for a safer and more secure electoral environment in 2024 and beyond” and called on the stakeholders to get involved in ensuring there was peace before, during, and after the 2024 elections. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Saeed Boachie Yiadom, District Police Commander, Talensi, indicated that while it was essential for stakeholders to report on threats and vulnerabilities, it was also important for them to know where to channel those reports for the desired actions to be taken. He called on the stakeholders to collaborate with the police by providing them with the necessary information to help advance the democratic fabric of the country through maintaining law and order. Naab Nwarebilsong Naneeteng, chief of the Gaare Traditional Area and Chairman of the IPDC, reechoed that peace was essential for the development of every community and that it was important stakeholders played their roles to ensure the continuous existence of peace in the community. Mr Jonas Mustapha Musogo, the Talensi District Director of the Electoral Commission, said the Commission, as a neutral body, was poised to ensure free and fair elections come December 2024 and called on the political parties to come to the table of dialogue whenever they had issues.",

        "description": "A new survey shows employers'concerns about hiring new grads, based onGen Z employees'attitudes and expectations, as well as a wariness to bringpro-Palestinian protestors into the workplace.",
        "content": "Graduation season is in full swing, meaning with young people across the U.S. are striding across stages to collect their college diplomas, then stepping straight off to enter the labor market. However, many of those new job hunters may be taken aback at the reception they receive from less than impressed business owners--especially those averse to hiring participants in pro-Palestinian protests that swept university campuses since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas, and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of Gaza. While many companies report having a harder time finding qualified job candidates than before the pandemic, a recent survey found considerable wariness among hiring managers to offering positions to recent Gen Z college grads. The poll by Intelligent.com, a higher education advisory company, showed respondents gave a variety of reasons for those hesitations, with perhaps the most surprising being a candidate's past participation in controversial pro-Palestinian demonstrations . Fully 30 percent of bosses said they'd be concerned with a job applicant's activities during those protests, with 22 percent saying they were \"reluctant to hire graduates who participated.\" The rational for that hesitation makes sense on the surface, since a workplace functions best when there's no overt political, religious or cultural conflicts within a company's staff. But making a history of participating in protests a significant factor in hiring decisions make eventually spark nearly as much debate as the underlying Israel-Hamas war itself. Nearly two-thirds of respondents feared people associated with the pro-Palestinian movements that have spread across U.S. college campuses over the past six month would prove \"too confrontational\" as employees. Almost 60 percent worried those hires would be too politically inclined, and 55 percent voiced concerns they'd make co-workers feel uncomfortable. Despite those misgivings, 57 percent of the 1,268 business leaders surveyed said a job applicant's association with pro-Palestinian protests wouldn't ultimately affect whether they got the job. The 22 percent of survey participants who voiced reluctance to hiring protestors, meanwhile, was matched by 21 percent who said they'd actually prefer someone who'd supported the movement joining their company. Given the horror of the initial Hamas terror attack on October 7 that killed at least 1,200 Israelis and saw hundreds taken hostage--some of whom are still in Hamas' captivity--and ensuing war that has reportedly claimed over 35,000 Palestinian lives in Gaza--it's not surprising students, employers, and workers alike have formed strong opinions about the conflict. Yet Intelligence.com chief education and career development advisor Huy Nguyen says that while echoes of those debates arising in the workplace are inevitable, considering people's personal positions and reactions as a criterion in hiring is an error. \"This survey highlights the unfortunate reality where political issues, social activism, and divisiveness are spilling over into the workplace,\" explains Nguyen. \"As political polarization intensifies, companies appear more likely to make biased judgments about recent graduates based on ideologies or personal behaviors, like protesting or social media activities. \"(But) it would be prudent for both employers and job seekers to keep politics out of the hiring process,\" he added. \"Focusing on a candidate's qualifications, demonstrable skills, and personal merit is the best way to consider how well someone might succeed in the given role they are applying for.\" Alas, there's more bad--but non-political--news for Gen Z college grads in the survey. About half the employer respondents said they'd become increasingly concerned about hiring those younger candidates in the past five years. The leading reason cited was Gen Z workers expecting \"high salaries,\" with the second and third critiques being they were more entitled, and had \"worse work ethics\" than previous generations.\" Other knocks on Gen Zers: They have \"fewer practical skills,\" \"lack mental toughness,\" and are \"more difficult to train\" than their elders. The good news in that is bosses with job openings will have lots of opportunities to work on improving that Gen Z employee performance and attitude. The cohort represents a sizable fraction of the current labor force--and its importance and size will only grow, perhaps into a climate of shifting attitudes.",

        "content": "RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) on Monday launched the Neo Space Group to work on the kingdom’s nascent satellite and space industry, its first investment in the sector. One of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, the PIF has already invested heavily in sports, gaming and so-called Saudi giga-projects including Neom, a $500-billion futuristic megacity under construction in the desert. The Neo Space Group or NSG is the “PIF’s first investment focused on the space industry”, the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement. It “aims to develop and enhance commercial space operations in Saudi Arabia, providing innovative satellite and space solutions locally and globally”, the PIF said. It will also “invest in localization, technology, start-ups, and knowledge in the space and satellite sector in Saudi Arabia” in the latest bid to boost economic diversification. Under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has sought both to open up and diversify its oil-reliant economy. From world-class footballers to a new national airline and even a speciality shop serving camel milk gelato, the PIF has splashed billions on acquisitions intended to support diversification. The fund has also made high-profile investments in foreign firms including stakes in Uber, electric car maker Lucid and video game company Activision Blizzard. Domestic investments constitute the vast majority of its portfolio, however. “The establishment of NSG marks an important milestone in the development of the growing satellite and space sector in Saudi Arabia,” said Omar Al-Madhi, PIF’s co-head of MENA Direct Investments. Last year, Saudi Arabia sent its first two astronauts into space, including Rayyanah Barnawi, the kingdom’s first female astronaut. — AFP",

        "content": "In a massive stride for India’s electoral polity, Jammu and Kashmir witnessed its highest poll participation in the last 35 years. The Combined Voter Turnout (VTR) at the polling stations for the entire Union Territory (5 Lok Sabha seats) was 58.46 % in the General Elections 2024 . This significant participation is a testament to the robust democratic spirit and civic engagement of the people in the region. Commission led by CEC Rajiv Kumar along with ECs Sh. Gyanesh Kumar and Sh. Sukhbir Singh Sandhu thanked the polling personnel and security officials over the peaceful conduct of elections in the UT. CEC Sh. Rajiv Kumar while conveying ECIs compliments to the voters of J&K said “This achievement sits on a credible weave of 25% increase in number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhanced citizen involvement and Suvidha Portal showing 2455 requests for rallies etc., reflecting the steady retaking of the election & campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller participation. Compared this outcome of the layered depth of electoral mobilization and participation, as reminiscent of the fame and deft of the legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave. This active participation is a huge positive for Assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in the Union Territory”. UT of Jammu and Kashmir comprises 5 PCs namely Srinagar, Baramulla, Anantnag Rajouri, Udhampur and Jammu. The combined VTR for the 5 PCs in past few elections is given below: * PC of Ladakh has been removed which was part of erstwhile state of J&K for comparison. ** Graph depicts Gross VTR for 1996-2019; For 2024, VTR is at polling stations The voter turnout of 50.86% from the three Parliamentary Constituencies in the Kashmir Valley echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process. The poll participation percentage witnessed 30 points jump from the last GE in 2019 where it was 19.16% . The three PCs in the valley namely Srinagar, Baramulla and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded VTR of 38.49%, 59.1% and 54.84% respectively, which has been highest in last 3 decades. The other two PCs in the UT namely Udhampur and Jammu recorded 68.27% and 72.22% voter turnout respectively. Note: Due to delimitation exercise, the voter turnout data from previous elections for the PCs, may not be directly comparable *Graph depicts Gross VTR for 1996-2019; For 2024, VTR is at polling stations The historic participation in the UT was realised by earnest efforts of the election and security officials who had worked tirelessly to empower the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the youth to participate in the elections. More young people have asserted their faith and embraced democracy in a big way. Another interesting perspective is the electors in the age group of 18-59 years which forms the major part of electors in the UT. The high poll percentage in GE 2024 is reflective of their faith in democracy, which is a positive and heartening development. Age wise distribution of registered electors (percentage of total electors in a PC) in UT of J&K Age Groups Baramulla Srinagar Anantnag-Rajouri Udhampur Jammu 18 – 39 Years 56.02 48.57 54.41 53.57 47.66 40 – 59 Year 30.85 34.87 31.59 32.65 35.28 18 – 59 Years 86.87 83.44 86.00 86.22 82.94 60 & Above 13.13 16.56 14.00 13.78 17.06 The Commission has also enabled Kashmiri migrant voters residing at various relief camps in Delhi, Jammu, and Udhampur to also have the option of voting in person at designated special polling stations or using postal ballot. 21 Special Polling Stations were established at Jammu, 1 at Udhampur and 4 at Delhi. Ladakh, which was constituted as a separate Union Territory in 2019, also saw an enthusiastic response to the call of democracy as reflected in the VTR of 71.82%. Gross Voter Turnout in past few elections in each PC PC/Year 2019 2014 2009 2004 1999 1998 1996 1989 Srinagar 14.43% 25.86% 25.55% 18.57% 11.93% 30.06% 40.94% Uncontested Baramulla 34.6% 39.14% 41.84% 35.65% 27.79% 41.94% 46.65% 5.48% Anantnag 8.98% 28.84% 27.10% 15.04% 14.32% 28.15% 50.20% 5.07% Udhampur 70.15% 70.95% 44.88% 45.09% 39.65% 51.45% 53.29% 39.45% Jammu 72.5% 67.99% 49.06% 44.49% 46.77% 54.72% 48.18% 56.89% As part of awareness and outreach, wide range of activities were organized as part of SVEEP on the field in Jammu and Kashmir for the General Elections 2024. Office of the Chief Electoral Officer, J&K organised adventure sports events, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad natak and numerous other events to propagate the message of voting. Amongst various efforts, activities included creating Igloos as a dummy polling station in Baramulla, Para scooter event in Kathua, sensitization in Beating the Retreat ceremony on Suchetgarh border, mega awareness Rally in Teetwal near LOC, near Dal Lake in Srinagar to Chougan in Kishtwar and playing instrumental version of ECI song on highest railway bridge. Musical programmes and activities were carried out at many places including Lal chowk, Gulmarg, Kulgam, Anantnag by the famous singers. Every nook and corner of UT witnessed a rejuvenation of democracy and victory of ballot with thumping participation in polling, resulting in a record voters’ turnout.",

        "description": "The unclaimed coins were most likely buried in the medieval-era, between 1100 and 1125, during a period of political turmoil",
        "content": "A woman was out taking a casual stroll when she stumbled into a treasure trove in the Czech Republic. She found a ceramic pot containing thousands of coins in a field in the country’s Kutnohorsk Region, perhaps buried for a rainy day by its owner during a tumultuous period nearly 900 years ago. While the pot was found broken, likely due to agricultural work done in the area, but archeologists were able to use metal detectors to unearth more than 2,150 silver coins, known as denarii, scattered about. The hoard of rare coins is one of the most significant finds of the decade, the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic said in a news release . The unclaimed denarii were most likely buried in the medieval era, between 1100 and 1125, during a period of political turmoil, according to Filip Velímský, an archeologist with the institute. “It was probably placed in its place during the first quarter of the 12th century, at a time of internal political instability,” he was quoted in Popular Mechanics as saying. “At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague.” How much the coins were worth at the time isn’t known due to lack of available data, but it was likely a significant sum. Velímský compared the find to winning the lottery. “It was a huge amount, unimaginable for an ordinary person and at the same time unaffordable. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.” During the middle ages, the Kutnohorsku rival princes had frequent battles for the throne of nearby Prague. The coins were minted in Prague between 1085 and 1107 and date back to the reign of Přemysl rulers King Vratislav II, and princes Břetislav II and Bořivoje II. The buried treasure could be war loot or cash meant to pay wages, experts say. The denarii were made of a silver alloy, which included copper, lead and other trace metals. X-ray imaging and spectral analysis will help determine the precise composition, which will help date the coins. Experts expect to restore and document the artifacts in the coming year. The coins are expected to be displayed at a museum in Kutnohorsk by 2025. Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

        "content": "(Stacker) – Jam-packed parking lots, gridlocked roads, bustling crosswalks—these aren’t scenes from New York City or Los Angeles but from some of the country’s most popular national parks. According to reports from the National Park Service, destinations like Arches and Rocky Mountain National Parks have seen record visitation numbers in recent years, resulting in unprecedented overcrowding. Fortunately, the National Park Service is already taking steps to save our national parks from being visited to death. Most notably, several of the nation’s most-visited parks have implemented permit systems, which require visitors to make advance reservations to enter. This helps park officials manage traffic flow and prevents parks from becoming overwhelmed by numbers they can’t accommodate. These permit systems aren’t without their critics, as some have said this measure can make it much more difficult for visitors to experience the national parks. But it’s important to note that most of these permit systems only apply during peak visitation season (namely, the summer months), so you can still enjoy a spontaneous national park trip during much of the rest of the year—at least for now. Using information from Outside and the National Park Service , Stacker compiled a list of six national parks that will require entry permits in 2024, excluding parks that only require permits for specific landmarks. Don’t forget that permit reservation fees won’t cover national park entrance fees, typically charged when you enter the park. Read on to learn where you’ll need a permit—and how to get one—this year. Yosemite first instituted its timed entry system in 2020 to limit visitor numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, but even when cases began to subside, Yosemite kept the permit system around to alleviate longstanding overcrowding issues. After removing the system for one year in 2023, the park has brought back the entry permit requirement for 2024. Permits have been required to enter the park on weekends and holidays since April 13 and will be required every day from July 1 through Aug. 16. From Aug. 17 through Oct. 27, permits will only be required on weekends and holidays again. Most permits were released on Jan. 5 this year, but for last-minute trip planners, further permits can be reserved seven days before your expected arrival date. Inside Yosemite, you can marvel at the views of El Capitan and Half Dome or hike one of the park’s many scenic trails, all while enjoying the benefits of fewer crowds. Mount Rainier National Park has seen a 40% uptick in visitor numbers over the past 10 years. To preserve the park’s delicate environment and offer an improved visitor experience, Mount Rainier will require permits to enter both the Paradise and Sunrise Corridors during peak visitation days in 2024. Reservations are needed for Paradise Corridor from May 24 to Sept. 2, while Sunrise Corridor requires entry permits from July 4 to Sept. 2. Both the Sunrise and Paradise areas offer their own unique attractions—Sunrise features stunning views of Mount Rainier and the Cascade Range, while Paradise hosts the park’s main visitor center and abundant wildflower meadows. You’ll need to reserve two separate permits if you want to visit both spots this summer, but if the timed entry system works according to plan, you hopefully won’t have to share the park with too many other tourists. Anyone who’s visited Arches National Park in recent years won’t be surprised to find it on this list. After experiencing significant overcrowding for more than a decade, Arches implemented a timed entry program in 2022. Now in its third year, the system continues to evolve to accommodate visitors and provide the best experience possible. Entry permits are released in monthly blocks three months before each month (for example, permits for September visits are released on June 1). A small number of additional permits are released one day ahead of time, which allows for a certain degree of spontaneity in planning your trip, though these permits may get snapped up quickly. Explore the park’s namesake sandstone foundations and learn more about the unique combination of elements that led to their creation, keeping an eye out for wildlife like bighorn sheep that have made a home in this desert landscape. From May 24 through Oct. 20, every vehicle that enters Rocky Mountain National Park will need a timed entry permit . There are two different types of permits: Timed Entry+, which includes popular destinations along Bear Lake Road, and the regular Timed Entry option, which excludes Bear Lake access. You’ll have to pay close attention as you reserve your permit. It might seem onerous to plan your trip activities so far in advance. But considering you’re helping preserve the park’s gorgeous, one-of-a-kind alpine landscapes using the timed entry system, a little extra legwork doesn’t seem so bad. When hiking to Lake Haiyaha or soaking up the sights at Moraine Park, your permit will be all the more worth it. As most of its attractions are deep underground, Carlsbad Caverns is slightly different from the other parks on this list. Carlsbad requires timed entry permits 362 days a year , from January through December. The only exceptions are Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s, when the park is closed to the public. But park officials have long restricted entry to Carlsbad Caverns, reducing strain on the sprawling cave system and karst formations. You can view the caves on ranger-guided tours, which depart from the visitor center several times a day, or you can hike down alone. In the summer of 2024, Glacier National Park will require visitors to have a vehicle reservation to access Going-to-the-Sun Road, the North Fork area, and Many Glacier valley. Entry to these areas will be restricted between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. from May 24 through Sept. 8, exact start dates vary with each location. If you have your trip dates set ahead of time, try to snag one of the reservations available 120 days (four months) before your trip. If you’re unsure, log in to recreation.gov early the day before your arrival to book a permit. Those reservations will grant you access to some of the most spectacular natural landscapes in the western U.S. Going-to-the-Sun Road winds past snowy Rocky Mountain peaks, while Many Glacier valley features dramatic alpine scenery that draws hikers from all over the world.

        "description": "Awards for Beate and Serge Klarsfeld come at a time of rising animosity in Germany towards German Jews and migrants",
        "content": "The holiday season is almost here but some younger Germans already have their summer party hit: L’Amour Toujours by Gigi d’Agostino. In Germany 2024, though, the Italian DJ’s tune from 2000 has acquired an unofficial new singalong chorus: “Deutschland den Deutschen, Ausländer raus” – Germany for the Germans, foreigners out. Last week a video popped up online of well-groomed 20-somethings on the exclusive holiday island of Sylt singing along, and making illegal Hitler salutes. Within days most of those identified in the video had either apologised or lost their jobs – or both. READ MORE Amid rising animosity, Macron honours Nazi-hunting couple in Germany Robert F Kennedy jnr’s election campaign: ‘I think he is going to be president Kennedy’ Germany’s next chancellor? Where did it all go right for Friedrich Merz? The ANC has won six South African elections since 1994 but its winning streak may be over But the video opened the L’Amour Toujours sluice gates, with similar party footage from a beer tent in Lower Saxony, a wine festival in Rhineland-Palatinate and a beach party in Saxony. Same song, same xenophobic chants, but it is the Sylt party people who have caught the imagination. The cheering was not by the usual skinhead or football fan suspects but privileged, Porsche-driving heirs, men and women, with jobs in law and tech firms and a taste for the good life. Amid the hail of outrage and shame-filled apologies from those involved, though, opinion is divided on whether to view the incident as juvenile provocation or something more worrying. When Beate Klarsfeld was their age, in the early 1960s, she had just moved from her native Berlin to Paris to work as an au pair – a brave move considering the Nazis had left the country just 15 years previously. Soon she met her future husband Serge Klarsfeld, who had narrowly escaped a Gestapo deportation to Auschwitz, and the two worked on researching and exposing the fate of 76,000 deported French Jews. Along the way they tracked down many former senior Nazis including Klaus Barbie, a Gestapo chief and the so-called “Butcher of Lyon”. They also located SS special commander and Holocaust planner Alois Brunner , whose deportations of 128,500 Jews in the war years included that of Serge’s father in Nice. Beate Klarsfeld has been a household name in her native (West) Germany since November 1968 when she crashed the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party conference and delivered a mighty slap to its leader and then chancellor, Kurt Kiesinger. A trained lawyer, Kiesinger joined the Nazi party in 1933 and worked in the foreign ministry propaganda section before rising through the CDU ranks in postwar West Germany to become its third chancellor. After the slap, Klarsfeld was arrested and put on trial the same day, telling the court she was “hitting back, in the name of the 50 million [war] dead and future generations, the repellent face of 10 million Nazis”. Her sentence for assault was never enforced, in part due to huge public protest. On Tuesday, Beate and Serge Klarsfeld were awarded France’s highest civilian orders personally by President Emmanuel Macron during his state visit to Germany. [ Nazi-hunting couple wins top German award (2015) ] Macron described the work of Beate and Serge, now 85 and 88, as a “commitment against forgetting and impunity”. Beate Klarsfeld’s Kiesinger attack was, he said, “a wake-up call that made you a heroine of truth”. “This slap struck a face but also a conscience, it shook an order based on oblivion and impunity,” said Macron. The Klarsfelds’ work also forced his homeland, Macron added, to acknowledge “the complicity of the French authorities in the arrest of foreign and stateless Jews”. Accepting her award, Klarsfeld expressed concern that “young people don’t know the history any more”. Amid a charged atmosphere in Germany, and growing animosity towards German Jews and migrant communities, chancellor Olaf Scholz described the Sylt chants as “disgusting”. His Social Democratic Party, in a spin on the original chant, posted on Instagram: “Germany for Germans who defend democracy.” After protests, the post was deleted.

        "description": "Go private allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability back to Canada's biggest bookstore",
        "content": "TORONTO — shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which have a 56 per cent stake in Indigo and are owned by , the spouse of Indigo chief executive . The Trilogy companies originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. “We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,” Reisman said in a statement following the vote. “We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.” Indigo spokesperson Madison Downey said in an email to The Canadian Press that Trilogy would not be commenting on the vote. For Trilogy’s offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal. Just shy of 83 per cent of the votes from shareholders not linked to Trilogy and affiliates were in support of the offer. The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada’s biggest bookstore. “The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,” said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and “a loss of confidence in board leadership.” Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren’t looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. “Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,” Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. “They are bleeding cash.” To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Cafe & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn’t said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo’s share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Tennis legend Rafael Nadal said that he’s unsure of Roland Garros 2024 being his last appearance in the French Open after being knocked out by Alexander Zverev on Monday, May 27. Notably, Zverev emerged victorious against the 14-time French Open champion with a scoreline of 3-6, 6-7, 3-6. Despite being dominated by his opponent for most of the three-hour-long game , Nadal continued to fight his way back into the match through some of his vintage shots. Following his loss, the Spaniard thanked the crowd for their tremendous support throughout the game and said that he was not sure whether it would be his last appearance in the tournament ever. “The amount of energy.. it’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it’s gonna be the last time here in front of all of you. I’m not sure. But if it’s the last time I enjoyed it. The crowd was amazing during the whole week of preparation. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me it so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most,” Nadal said after the game. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year ðçá #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/7hX4Gw46WE — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 “I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than 2 months ago. Maybe in 2 months I say it’s enough. But it’s something I don’t feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That’s going to be another chance,” he added. Notably, Rolland Garros 2024 was Nadal’s first Grand Slam appearance of the year after he missed out on the Australian open. The 22-time Grand Slam winner got a rousing reception upon his arrival at the court where he has lived some of the highest points of his career. The southpaw was handed just the fourth loss of his illustrious career at the Rolland Garros as Zverev became just the third man to beat him at the grand event. Earlier, Robin Soderling (2009) and Novak Djokovic (2015 and 2021) have also emerged victorious against Nadal in the competition.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Palestinian Death Toll Eclipses 36,000 Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. Egyptian Soldier Reportedly Killed In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Strike on Rafah Brings More Condemnation of Israel The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Rights Groups Critical of Israeli Investigations, Accountability Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders are expected to vote Monday on whether the retailer should accept a sweetened offer from a holding company that plans to take the bookstore chain private. An Indigo bookstore is seen Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020 in Laval, Que. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz Indigo Books & Music Inc. shareholders have voted to approve a deal that will see the retailer become a private company. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which have a 56 per cent stake in Indigo and are owned by Gerald Schwartz, the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman. The Trilogy companies originally offered $2.25 per share but raised their bid in April. \"We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,\" Reisman said in a statement following the vote. \"We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.\" Indigo spokesperson Madison Downey said in an email to The Canadian Press that Trilogy would not be commenting on the vote. For Trilogy's offer to be accepted, it required approval by a two-thirds majority vote of Indigo shareholders and a simple majority vote by shareholders not linked to Trilogy and its affiliates. Some 95.09 per cent of votes from shareholders represented at the meeting Monday were in favour of accepting the deal. Just shy of 83 per cent of the votes from shareholders not linked to Trilogy and affiliates were in support of the offer. The privatization allows Indigo to avoid some scrutiny as it works to bring profitability and growth back to Canada’s biggest bookstore. “The rationale is not to be saddled with public reporting responsibilities because Indigo has been through a lot,\" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University in Toronto, in February, when the Trilogy firms made their offer. Trilogy now faces a hefty amount of work. Indigo is still recovering from a cyber attack that downed its website for a lengthy period last year, a series of quarterly losses leading up to a January layoff, and a succession of changes that saw four of 10 board members depart last year with one claiming mistreatment and \"a loss of confidence in board leadership.\" Reisman, who retired amid the turmoil, returned within months to helm Indigo. The issues have played out as inflation and high interest rates make many Canadians think twice about opening their wallets, especially for the discretionary items Indigo is known for. The trend cropped up particularly in the holiday season, when Indigo executives admitted they had overbought merchandise and stocked an assortment of merchandise they found customers weren’t looking for in the final weeks before Christmas. \"Despite all their best efforts, they are not doing well,” Kai Li, the Canada Research Chair in corporate governance who teaches at the University of British Columbia, said of Indigo in February. “They are bleeding cash.” To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” In the months since she mentioned the plan, some stores have seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Café & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. Trilogy hasn’t said much about its plans for Indigo beyond it wanting to take the company private, but no public opposition to the deal has mounted, likely because the money offered reflected a 69 per cent premium on the share price of $1.48 that Indigo had when Trilogy first made its bid. Indigo's share price sat at $2.48 ahead of the Monday vote. Last month, the offer garnered the support from a special committee of independent directors Indigo formed to assess the deal. Earlier this month, Indigo also said that leading independent proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders approve the deal. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after.",

        "content": "It took seven hours for Gary Shaughnessy, who lives with Parkinson’s and was accompanied by his friend, David Carver, to paddle the full distance from Torran Bay to Kilchurn Castle last weekend. Over the two preceding days, the duo kayaked across Llyn Tegid and Lake Windermere, the largest lakes, respectively, in Wales and England. Gary, who is a seasoned fundraiser, is planning further challenges this year, including 10 marathons in 10 days, and a half ironman triathlon, which he hopes will see him cover 2025 miles in 2024. In addition to raising funds, Gary is also on a mission to raise awareness about Parkinson’s, which is the fastest growing neurological condition in the world, and affects around 153,000 people in the UK. Gary said: “It’s also about feeling more in control of my own condition. “Parkinson’s makes you feel like you’ve lost control, but when I’m doing exercise I feel more in charge and it helps relieve my symptoms. It helps me poke Parkinson’s in the eye. Those who know me will know that I have never let my Parkinson’s hold me back.”",

        "content": "The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) today updated its Long-Range Forecast Outlook for the Southwest Monsoon Rainfall Season (June–September) 2024. It also released the Monthly Rainfall and Temperature Forecast for June 2024 in a virtual media interaction today in New Delhi. Dr. Mritunjya Mohapatra, Director General of Meteorology, presented the forecast. Highlights of the Long Range forecast Quantitatively, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 106% of the long period average (LPA) with a model error of ± 4%. Thus, Above Normal rainfall is most likely over the country as a whole during the monsoon season (June to September), 2024. The southwest monsoon seasonal (June to September, 2024) rainfall is most likely to be above normal over Central India and South Peninsular India (>106% of LPA), normal over Northwest India (92-108% of LPA) and below normal over Northeast India (106% of LPA). Above Normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except many areas of northern part of Northwest India, Northeast India and eastern part of the Central India and adjoining areas of east India, where below normal to normal rainfall is most likely. Normal rainfall (92-108% of LPA) is most likely over the country as a whole during June, 2024. The above normal monthly rainfall is most likely over most areas of the south peninsula, and adjoining areas of central India and over isolated areas of Northwest and Northeast India. Below normal rainfall is most likely over many areas of northern and eastern parts of Northwest India and eastern part of Central India, and over some areas over Northeast India and southeastern part of South Peninsula. In June, above-normal monthly maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of the southern peninsular India, where normal to below-normal temperatures are most likely. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are likely across most parts of the country, except extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely. During June, above-normal heatwave days are likely over most areas of Northwest India and adjoining areas of Central India. The strong El Niño conditions observed over equatorial Pacific in the beginning of this year have weakened rapidly into weak El Niño conditions and currently transitioning towards ENSO neutral conditions. The latest Climate model forecasts indicate ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to get established during the beginning of the monsoon season and La Niña conditions are likely to develop during the later part of the monsoon season. At present, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. The latest forecasts from many global climate models indicate positive IOD conditions are likely to develop during the monsoon season.",

        "content": "This Morning's Sian Welby found herself in a bit of a pickle when she had to wee on the side of the road during a traffic jam. Caught in a gruelling three-and-a-half-hour Bank Holiday traffic jam, the pregnant TV presenter opened up about how she couldn't hold it in any longer. At 37 weeks pregnant, Sian had no choice but to dash out of her car and seek refuge behind a bush for a quick relief. However, her roadside emergency took a painful turn as the chosen bush was riddled with nettles. The hilarious ordeal was caught on camera, showing Sian making a frantic sprint for a less thorny spot. Discussing the incident on Monday's This Morning show (May 27), Sian recounted: \"I had to do a wee in the middle of the road. I had to run into the bush and I didn't dare go in there as it was full of brambles and nettles.\" \"So then I was stuck and I ran to the side of the car. I'm 37 weeks pregnant\", reports the Daily Star . The pregnant star needed a wee during a traffic jam and rushed to the side of the road ( Image: ITV) The studio erupted in laughter as hosts Dermot O'Leary and Josie Gibson watched the clip. Even Giles Brandreth was shocked that the footage aired, exclaiming to Sian: \"Is this you coming back from your wee? \" As Sian laughed, Giles added: \"Now I've seen it all. Morning television isn't what it used to be, is it? \". Dermot chimed in with a cheeky comment: \"The mystique is definitely gone. But who doesn't love a pee-pee rustique from time to time.\" Sian responded: \"Do you know what, it was exhilarating.\" Siân announced that she was pregnant whilst live on Capital Breakfast alongside her co-hosts Roman Kemp and Chris Stark in February. She said: \"I've got a bit of an announcement for you! I'm pregnant! I don't know how I've managed to keep it from you for so long. [...] The lies, the deceit, the mocktails!\" She added: \"I couldn't wait to tell you. [...] This is a whole new journey for me and I want to take you all on it with me, and don't worry I'm not going anywhere! This is going to be a lot of fun and I can't wait to share it with you all.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .

        "content": "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria - Hundreds of people have fled their villages in a rural community in northwestern Nigeria after weekend attacks by armed groups left 10 dead and at least 160 missing, a local government chairman and two residents said on Monday. A year after President Bola Tinubu came to power promising to end widespread insecurity, kidnappings in the northwest by armed gangs demanding ransoms have become almost routine, with authorities seemingly powerless to stop them. Gunmen on motorbikes first attacked Kuchi community in Niger state's Munya local government area on Friday evening, killing five residents and five hunters who tried to fight back, before kidnapping dozens of people, said local chairman Aminu Ajume. The gunmen returned on Sunday night and seized livestock and food and burned shops, forcing at least 700 villagers to flee to nearby communities, Ajume added. \"As I am speaking to you, Munya is (a) no go area. They moved from house to house abducting people ... they abducted 160 villagers, including women,\" he told Reuters by phone. Kidnapping gangs, known locally as bandits, and members from a faction of insurgent group Boko Haram joined forces to launch the attacks, Ajume said without providing evidence. Boko Haram has been fighting an insurgency in the northeast since 2009 but Niger authorities have previously said its smaller faction had cells in the state and carried out some attacks. The police and army spokespersons in Niger state did not respond to several requests for comment. Maryam Abubakar, a resident, said she hid in the toilet when she heard sporadic gunfire around 1900 GMT on Friday and gunmen burst into her home shortly after. \"It was raining at that time. The bandits entered the house, searched the rooms and kitchen and they took my aunt and her two children,\" Abubakar said, adding the three were still missing. Musa Auwal was in his shop when gunmen attacked on Friday but he hid in a nearby bush, he said. When he returned the next day, his shop had been looted, so he fled to stay with relatives 60 km away.

The last entry was the 3D remake in 2009. The remake, and the original 1981 movie, both follow a killer in a miner outfit that may or may not be the ghost of Harry Warden, a deranged murderer from years before. His weapon of choice is usually a pickaxe. The 2009 remake was directed by Patrick Lussier and starred Jensen Ackles and Jamie King. It ended up earning $100.7 million at the box office on a $14 million budget. In spite of the success and the tease of a sequel, it never happened.",

        "content": "McDonald's is set to unveil its latest menu this week (May 29), just in time to welcome the summer vibes. Hungry patrons will soon have the chance to indulge in a slew of new treats, including the debut of the Skittles McFlurry (£2.19) and The Hat Trick burger (£5.89/ £7.69), which boasts a trio of beef patties, cheese, grilled onions, mustard, and ketchup, all nestled within a sesame seed bun. Returning classics such as the Chicken Sharebox (£10.59), nine-piece Chicken Selects Sharebox (£8.49), and Mozzarella Bites (£2.39) are making a comeback on the menu, alongside sweet delights like the Galaxy Caramel McFlurry (£2.19) and the Galaxy Chocolate and Raspberry Pie (£1.99). However, the departure of one iconic item is causing quite the stir among Brits. Read More Related Articles Greater Manchester McDonald's becomes one of first in region to get a futuristic redesign The much-loved Sour Cream and Chive dip is being phased out, available only while stocks last, and is set to be replaced by a new Garlic Mayo dip. Additionally, McDonald's barbecue dip is getting an upgrade to a new Sweet and Smokey barbecue sauce. While news of the fresh additions has excited many fans, there's been a collective mourning for the ultimate favourite: Sour Cream and Chive dip. Disgruntled voices took to Instagram, with one user exclaiming: \"Replacing the sour cream and chive dip? ! No that's the best dip.\" Another chimed in, saying: \"[You] can't have Chicken Select without sour cream.\" A third voiced their dismay: \"Why the f**k are they replacing sour cream and chive? ? I'll never order selects again.\" While another simply lamented: \"NOOOOOO! ! Not the sour cream.\" McDonald's frequently alters its menu based on the time of year, which means several fan favourites will be removed in the upcoming days. This includes the much-loved Biscoff McFlurry, Chicken Big Mac, and Biscoff Frappe. However, it's not all bad news, as the popular Iced Latte (£2.49) is set to make a comeback as a permanent fixture. The fast food giant describes the drink as 'perfect for when you want to cool down in the summer heat', and it's sure to become a morning essential for commuters.",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory .",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal only lost his fourth match in 116 matches since winning on debut in 2005, going down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Alexander Zverev. New Delhi: Rafael Nadal couldn’t definitively say whether it would be his final appearance at the French Open after getting beatean in the first round in Paris on Monday. The record 14-time champion only lost his fourth match in 116 matches since winning on debut in 2005, going down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Alexander Zverev. It was the Spaniard’s first defeat in the opening round of the tournament that came after he has battled multiple injuries throughout the year, having missed the Australian Open. He turns 38 on June 3 and in all likelyhood was his final appreance in his record-breaking French Open career. Though Nadal wasn;t immediately willing to confirm it. “It is difficult for me to talk, I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you,” he said. “Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most. “It’s hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago,” Nadal said. “Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. That is something I don’t feel yet.” Nadal confirmed his plans of competing at the 2024 Paris Olympics in Paris in two months “I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,” he said as the crowd cheered. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year 🧡 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/7hX4Gw46WE — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 ‘Thank you’ “I don’t know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour,” Zverev said. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.” Nadal has been crippled by injuries in recent months, allowing him to play only four tounaments since January of last year. It has seen him plummet to 275 in the ATP rankings and enter the French Open unseeded. He had earlier said that 2024 would be his last year on the ATP tour though prior to his opening round match he has said to “100% keep the door open”. But despite chants of “Rafa, Rafa” egging him on Court Philippe Chatrier, the 22 Grand Slam champion was under pressure against Zverev. There are no words. Merci, Rafa 🫶 #RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/znj0j42Qbf — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 But as the in-form Zverev dominated the proceedings and Nadal looked weary the support for him was stunned into silence. They were left to appreciate the achivements of the Spaniard as he lost the contest that stretched over three hours. Zverev’s celebration after the match was muted as he handed over the microphone for Nadal to deliver a courtside interview and clapped him off from the court. Zverev’s heartfull words to Nadal 🧡 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/liz9YdMDGY — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 Nadal, as always, was grateful for the gesture, thanking Zverev, wishing him good luck for the rest of the tournament and thanked the crowd who had been behind him throughout the years. “The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn’t think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process,” said Nadal, as he left the court to a standing ovation.",

        "content": "The West Lothian club announced on Monday that he will remain in charge in the wake of relegation from the Premiership. The Lions won only five of their 38 league fixtures as they finished a grim campaign ten points adrift at the foot of the table, leading to the manager’s future becoming a talking point. However, Martindale’s near-decade of “dedication” to the club, including his largely positive stint as manager since November 2020, have been taken into consideration by directors John McIlvogue, John Ward and Dave Black. The club also acknowledged that the team had been hindered by the fact Martindale’s playing budget was significantly cut for the campaign just finished. “There is no getting away from the fact that this season has been disappointing,” it read. “Every single member of staff inside the building is hurting with how the year transpired and we know full well that the same disappointment and upset is shared amongst our supporters. “However, we now have an opportunity to regroup, both on the park and in the stands, but we can only do with everyone pulling in the same direction. “David has been involved with the coaching set-up here for almost ten years now. “His involvement in the dugout has seen us lift a League One title, win the Premiership play-offs, two top-six finishes, two seasons just missing out on the top six on the final game before the split, a national cup final appearance and a club record six consecutive seasons in the top flight. “For a club of our size and stature, that is an incredible return – and a list of achievements that David deserves huge credit for. “As your board, we believe that David has earned the right to remain as first-team manager and have the opportunity to try to steer us back to the Premiership. “His commitment and dedication to the club over the years is unrivalled and whilst that alone can’t be the sole driver behind remaining in charge, his qualities as a manager, as a coach and as a leader give us full confidence that David is the man we want in charge of this football club going forward.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "Displaying a firm resolve towards finding green and sustainable transport solutions, the Indian Army has collaborated with Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) for demonstration trials of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus technology. The Indian Army is known for its commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Indian Army and the IOCL in presence of General Manoj Pande, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) and Mr Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, Chairman of Indian Oil. During the event, one Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus was received by the Indian Army. This marks the commencement of mutually beneficial partnership between Indian Army and IOCL. The MoU emphasised the commitment to fostering innovation and advancing sustainable transport solutions for the future. Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology offers a clean and efficient alternative by converting Hydrogen gas into electricity through an electro-chemical process. The process leaves water vapour as the only by product, thus ensuring zero emission. The Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus has a seating capacity of 37 passengers. It promises an impressive mileage of 250-300 km on a full 30 kg onboard tank of Hydrogen fuel. Notably, on 21 st March 2023, the Indian Army became the first government entity to ink an MoU with National Thermal Power Corporation Renewable Energy Limited for installation of Green Hydrogen based Microgrid Power Plants along the Northern Borders. A pilot project is being setup at Chushul, where a 200 Kilo Watt Green Hydrogen based Microgram will provide 24×7 clean electricity to troops deployed in inhospitable terrain and extreme climatic conditions. With a focus on innovation and environmental responsibility, the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus endeavour between Indian Army and IOCL represents a significant stride and pave the way for a cleaner and greener transport solutions.",

        "content": "Mrs Louisa Amoah, Executive Director of Girls Shall Grow, Obuasi-based NGO, has stressed the need to demystify the issue of menstruation and make it an open subject for people to discuss. She said it was time all the mysteries surrounding menstruation were brought to the fore to enable young girls to have better understanding and confidence of themselves during that period of natural phenomenon. “We realize that there is a whole hostile environment making it very difficult for girls to freely talk about menstruation and their experiences, so we are seizing opportunities like this to sensitize the girls to freely speak out whiles advising the public to make it easier for issues of menstruation to be discussed”, she told journalists in Obuasi, on the sidelines of a symposium to mark world menstrual day. It was organized by Girls Shall Grow in collaboration with the SRC Women Commission of the Obuasi campus of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). The symposium, which was under the theme “together for a period friendly world”, brought together about 300 students from KNUST- Obuasi campus, Junior High and Senior High schools in Obuasi, as well as health personnel to share their opinions on how to maintain menstrual hygiene. Mrs Amoah bemoaned the level of stigmatization and misconceptions associated with menstruation and said her organizations was at the forefront of campaigns to sensitize young girls on the need to maintain personal hygiene and correct certain misconceptions about menstruation. She said menstruation was a natural process experienced by all adolescent girls, hence, should not be treated as a taboo. She encouraged the girls to be confident and speak out against all forms of maltreatment encountered during menstruation. Menstrual health is a fundamental aspect of human rights, dignity, and public health. Menstrual Hygiene Day, observed annually on May 28th, is dedicated to breaking taboos and raising awareness about the importance of good menstrual hygiene management Dr. Enyonam Kwawukume, Obuasi East District Director of Health Services, who was the resource person on the day, took participants through the four phases of the menstrual cycle. These, she said included menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. She said common problems encountered by women during menstruation were heavy or painful periods and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). She advised the girls to be careful during menstrual cycle since the chances to get pregnant always increased at this stage. Ms Claudia Owusu Amoh, Women’s Commissioner of KNUST-Obuasi campus said the need for girls to maintain good hygiene during menstruation was what necessitated their collaboration with Girls Shall Grow for the program. She however, appealed to the government to intervene by making sanitary pads accessible to girls in school. “Now the cost factor in getting sanitary pads has become a challenge for parents. Whiles government looks at bringing the cost down, I am suggesting that government can give out free sanitary pads to schoolgirls just as we do for books and uniforms”. A pupil from the Boete L/ A JHS ‘B’, Miss Etilda Banoba, recounted the ordeal her mum goes through periodically to get sanitary pads for her. She said the cost of sanitary pads made it difficult for her to maintain proper hygiene during that month. “It hasn’t been easy since I started menstruating. The price of the pads is very high so getting sanitary pads and food at the same time is difficult for my mother to get. This is really a challenge for most of us”. She appealed to the government and other benevolent institutions to volunteer sanitary pads for girls, especially those in schools. This, she said, could help prevent frequent absenteeism in schools.",

        "content": "A doctoral thesis at the University of Oslo's Faculty of Dentistry points to the possibility of reconsidering standard treatment routines, aiming to improve the quality of life for people who survive head and neck cancer. Globally, head and neck cancer accounts for 5% of all cancer types , with a mortality rate of 50%. However, in the Nordic countries, head and neck cancer accounts for only 2.6% of all cancers, with a mortality rate of just 30%. But more survivors mean that many must live with extensive damage and side effects after cancer and cancer treatment. \"It is the exposed and vulnerable location that makes head and neck cancer one of the most mutilating types of cancer,\" explains Lisa Printzell. She works as a specialist in oral prosthetics at the ear, nose, and throat department at Rikshospitalet. Recently, she completed a doctorate at the University of Oslo, where she investigated an alternative rehabilitation pathway for head and neck cancer patients. \"Damage from surgery and radiation therapy can make it difficult for patients to chew, swallow, and speak afterward,\" says Printzell. In some, their appearance changes significantly, which they may find incompatible with a normal or dignified life. Printzell also explains that before patients can receive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer, a number of teeth often need to be removed to prevent infections. \"For most patients, this news comes as a great shock. Some find the news of having to pull teeth almost as brutal as the diagnosis of serious cancer,\" says the researcher. \"Anatomical changes after cancer surgery can create significant functional and aesthetic challenges. However, the side effects of radiation therapy are perhaps what make oral rehabilitation most demanding,\" Printzell explains. Patients often have thin, dry, and very fragile oral mucosa after radiation therapy, making it difficult to use ordinary dental prostheses that rest on toothless jaws. \"To achieve satisfactory oral rehabilitation in these patients, dental implants are often used to support and attach prostheses or other dental replacements,\" Printzell explains. Dental implants are titanium screws that are surgically inserted and integrated into the patient's jawbone. These so-called osseointegrated implants then serve as an attachment for various types of dental replacements. A major challenge in this context is that irradiated tissue has a reduced ability to heal, leading to reduced and uncertain integration (osseointegration) of dental implants. \"The survival of dental implants placed in irradiated jawbones is significantly lower than those placed in non-irradiated patients,\" says Printzell. She notes that any surgical procedure in previously irradiated jawbone carries an increased risk of infection. Besides the lack of healing ability, it can, in the worst case, result in osteoradionecrosis, where the jawbone dies as a result of the radiation treatment. Due to the risks involved, rehabilitation with dental implants for these patients is not considered until at least one year after the completion of radiation therapy. Patients experience this as a long waiting period with significantly reduced quality of life. \"Therefore, we need research on alternative methods. At the very least, methods that can provide a faster oral rehabilitation for the group of these patients who need it the most,\" explains Printzell. One possibility for this is to install the implants before radiation therapy starts, in connection with cancer surgery or tooth extraction. Printzell explains that so-called primary installation of implants is not unknown. Studies have shown an increased use of this approach in the past decade, always justified by the increased quality of life for patients. However, despite the undeniable benefits of faster oral rehabilitation, clinicians remain somewhat hesitant and skeptical of this approach. One reason for this is the concern about the \"backscatter effect,\" which occurs when radiation hits the implants. \"When ionizing radiation is directed at a cancerous tumor and there is a titanium implant in the radiation field, not all the radiation will penetrate the metal. Instead, it will reflect back to the surrounding tissue,\" Printzell explains. Healthy cells on the implant's surface will then receive a higher radiation dose and may suffer more damage than they would if there were no implant present. \"There is a concern that this will negatively affect the ongoing osseointegration (healing) of the implant, and thereby also the survival of the implant,\" says Printzell. Printzell notes that very little is known about how harmful this backscatter effect really is. Therefore, she and her colleagues wanted to investigate this further. They assessed the effect of backscatter radiation from titanium on two of the most important cell types for bone healing and osseointegration of dental implants . These cell types are called human mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. Human mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to develop into many different cell types, including osteoblasts, which are the precursors to mature bone cells. Printzell adds, \"In our experiments, these cells were seeded on two different titanium surfaces, as well as a plastic surface. The cells were then exposed to various doses of ionizing gamma radiation, relevant to what is used in cancer treatment. The titanium surfaces generated backscatter radiation to the cells, while the plastic surface represented 'jawbone without an implant present.'\" In cancer treatment, radiation doses are measured in gray (Gy). Gray is the international unit for measuring absorbed radiation dose. Patients typically receive radiation therapy in small doses (often 2 Gy) 5 days a week until the total dose (50–70 Gy) is achieved after 5–7 weeks. The purpose of administering many small doses over time is to give healthy cells in the radiation field time to repair minor DNA damage between doses. \"We found that backscatter radiation from titanium generated as much as a 40% increased radiation dose to the cells closest to the titanium surface. However, the lowest doses (2 and 6 Gy) caused minimal effect on the cells,\" says Printzell. Higher radiation dose (10 Gy) significantly reduced the number of osteoblasts (bone-producing cells) on titanium surfaces compared to plastic surfaces but increased the surviving cells' ability to develop into mature bone cells. \"We also found that the highest dose of 10 Gy inhibited both cell types' ability to move from one place to another on titanium, while lower doses (2 and 6 Gy) neither caused significant DNA damage nor affected the cells' ability to move. \"The results indicate that backscatter radiation from titanium at doses of 2 Gy does not cause greater cell damage than the same dose does without an implant present,\" says Printzell. She says more research is, of course, needed to establish this treatment as the first choice for this patient group. \"Nevertheless, we can conclude that our findings are important for the question of whether backscatter radiation from titanium implants should be a reason to avoid the so-called primary installation of implants in patients who are to undergo radiation therapy.\" Printzell explains that when they started this study, they knew there is an increased risk of placing implants in previously irradiated jawbone. What they did not know was whether it involves greater, lower, or the same risk to insert implants in these patients just before they undergo radiation therapy. \"What we did know, and still know today, is that implant-supported dental replacements significantly increase the quality of life for head and neck cancer patients, and the earlier the patient can be rehabilitated in this way, the shorter the road back to a somewhat normal life,\" says Printzell.

        "description": "Losing Acuna is a brutal blow for a Braves team with grand aspirations.",
        "content": "The Braves entered 2024 with the second-best World Series odds, and it now appears that the wheels are falling off in Atlanta. Ronald Acuna Jr. suffered an ACL tear Sunday in non-contact injury that will sideline him for the rest of the season and seismically shifts the National League landscape. Prior to the injury, the Braves were +425 to win the World Series, according to BetMGM , but have fallen off massively, dropping to +800 odds to win the illustrious last game of the season. Their chances of winning the NL East also dropped dramatically, from near pick ’em status down to +160, as the Phillies continue their torrid stretch where they have opened up a six-game lead in the division. Philadelphia (38-16) has the league’s best winning percentage, grabbing a six-game lead on the Braves (30-20) entering Memorial Day. But the loss of Acuna seriously downgrades Atlanta’s hope for a few big wins come October — and at least raises questions about whether Atlanta can even reach the postseason. The Braves opened the season at -3000 to make the playoffs and are sitting at an impressive -10000 on FanDuel even after the injury, with the best odds to fade them to make the playoffs being 22/1 at DraftKings . But it’s tough to fade the Braves to make the playoffs even without Acuna, as baseball has expanded the playoffs to the point that the Mets are still just four games back of the third and final wild-card spot despite being eight games under .500. Losing Acuna is a brutal blow for a Braves team with grand aspirations, with Acuna Jr. winning his first MVP last year to help Atlanta grab the NL’s No. 1 seed. He had been off to a slow start this year, though, hitting just four homers with a .250/.351/.365 slash line, a far cry from last year’s .337/.416/.596 numbers. The fact that the Braves are 10 games over despite Acuna’s slow start, losing Spencer Strider for the season after two starts and catcher Sean Murphy being sidelined for all but one game entering Monday is nothing short of impressive and shows just how deep they are organizationally. But now it’s a different animal for the Braves to pull this off without their best player. The Phillies could’ve been had at -135 on Bet365 after the injury to win the NL East, but that has ballooned massively to -190. That’s not the worst bet considering all the Braves have to deal with now as their team completely changes. PICK: Phillies win NL East (-190, FanDuel )",

TAURUS (April 21 - May 21): Look and act sharp as the week begins and make sure your rivals get the impression that you are not the sort of person who can be taken advantage of. Image is important at the best of times but now it could be crucial to your long-term success. GEMINI (May 22 - June 21): Your head may be full of amazing ideas but there is no way you are going to be able to make use of them all, so pick the best three ideas and junk the rest. What you don’t do today is almost as important as what you do do. CANCER (June 22 - July 23): Don’t waste time and energy on activities that are unlikely to turn a profit for quite some time. Focus on what you do best and aim to see some kind of return on your efforts in a matter of days rather than weeks or months. LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23): There are precious few limitations or restrictions being imposed on you now, so feel free to come and go as you please and don’t think you have to tone down your ambitions just to please other people. Think only of pleasing yourself. VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23): Give yourself permission to dream an impossible dream and ignore those who say you don’t stand a chance of success. It’s that kind of thinking that has held you back in the past and you have no intention of letting it hold you back now. LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23): By all means free your imagination today but don’t get carried away to such an extent that you start believing in unicorns and other mythical beasts. Unless you are writing fiction, of course, in which case it might just be a best-seller! SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22): Partners and colleagues will be rather demanding today and like it or not you are going to have to cut back on your own plans so you have more time to assist them. Do so with good grace because they will do the same for you later on. SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21): You may not be the touchy-feely sort but it will pay you to be more open about your emotions today. If you let loved ones know what is bugging you they will go out of their way to ease your fears and put a smile back on your face. CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20): You may think you have got a considerable amount of leeway on the work front but don’t push your luck too far today or your boss could get annoyed with you. You’re on the same side and should be pulling in the same direction. AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19): Others may say you are being selfish for putting your own needs first but with so much cosmic activity working in your favor now you would be a fool not to. Don’t look back from later in the year and wish you had been more ambitious. PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20): The most important thing now is that you set yourself a schedule and stick to it religiously. Others will try to get you to change it as the week goes on but you must be stubborn and refuse to do more than you know will be good for you. BIRTHDAY MONDAY: Forget about taking the easy route through life and aim to be more daring and adventurous over the coming 12 months. The more some people say you are aiming too high the more you must strive to prove them wrong. Act as if there are no limits. Discover more about yourself at sallybrompton.com See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook.",
        "content": "The Palm Beach Health Network has become the latest health provider accused of illegally sharing identities and private health information of its patients with the social media company Meta, owner of Facebook. A lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach says the health network's websites share code with Meta that enables patients to be targeted with advertising on Facebook based on \"highly sensitive personal information\" they share. It names as defendants the Palm Beach Health Network Physicians Group, doing business as Palm Beach Health Network, and Palm Beach Gardens Community Hospital, doing business as Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. Palm Beach Health Network is the largest health care network in Palm Beach County, the suit states. It includes a large multi-specialty physician group, ambulatory surgery centers, outpatient diagnostic facilities, and six hospital and care centers, including Delray Medical Center, Good Samaritan Medical Center, Palm Beach Children's Hospital, St. Mary's Medical Center, West Boca Medical Center and Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center. The network, according to the lawsuit, has \"disregarded the privacy rights of their patients who used their web properties by intentionally, willfully, recklessly and/or negligently failing to implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the users' personally identifiable information and protected health information was safeguarded.\" Andrew Lofholm, spokesman for the network, said on Thursday, \"We are not commenting on that,\" referring to the lawsuit. The suit claims that the network installed Facebook's Meta Pixel and other invisible third-party tracking technology on its websites to intercept patients' information \"with the express purpose\" of disclosing the information to Meta and other third parties. Meta encourages businesses to install its tracking code and does not offer any tools that allow users \"to opt out of such extensive tracking,\" the suit states, adding, \"even the most sophisticated users who enable cookie blockers cannot avoid having their information tracked through the various Meta tracking tools.\" The practice violates the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as state and federal law, the suit claims. The technology collects patient data regardless of whether they have a Facebook account, the suit states. \"Facebook maintains 'shadow profiles' on users without Facebook accounts and links information collected via the Pixel to the user's real-world identity using their shadow profile,\" it says. The lawsuit alleges that its lead plaintiff, Ron Prosky, used Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center's website and patient portal to search for doctors, make appointments, review medical treatments and review his medical records, including imaging results, for a specific health issue that the publicly available version of the lawsuit redacted. Prosky then began receiving advertisements on his Facebook account \"relating to his particular medical conditions and treatments,\" the suit claims. After receiving information about patients and their conditions, \"Meta then shares the information with additional unauthorized third parties whose businesses and advertisements are related to those conditions,\" the suit claims. Prosky relied on the health network's privacy policies and reasonably expected it would safeguard his private information, the suit alleges. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of claims since 2022 accusing health networks across the United States of illegally sharing patient information with third parties such as Facebook and Google. In January, North Carolina-based Norvant Health agreed to pay $6.6 million to settle claims against it. In 2022, the company admitted that 1.3 million patients' information was leaked to Facebook, saying Pixel was \"configured incorrectly.\" In 2023, Advocate Aurora Health agreed to pay $12.25 million to settle multiple lawsuits alleging pixel tracking tools, including Meta, Google and others. In a separate case, Milwaukee-based Froedtert Health reached a $2 million settlement over charges it installed the Meta Pixel tool without patients' knowledge, according to Becker's Hospital Review. Last July, the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights and the Federal Trade Commission sent letters to 66 hospitals and health systems warning that they might be violating federal health privacy laws by installing pixel tracking technologies on their websites. Palm Beach Health Network was not among the systems notified, according to a post by Becker's Hospital Review. Meta itself is the subject of a class-action suit in California filed in June 2022 by plaintiffs who claim at least 664 medical entities use its technology, according to published reports. Meta blamed the providers, stating they control the code placed on their websites and they choose what information it sends to Meta. Meta also argued that the plaintiffs did not violate patients' health privacy, saying the only information the company received were the URLs of websites browsed by the plaintiffs. Two motions by Meta to have the lawsuit dismissed failed. One claimed patients hadn't sufficiently established the company's intent to collect their information. That was defeated by the judge in August. In January, the judge disagreed with Meta's contention that an amended complaint lacked specific examples that patients' information was transmitted. He ruled that the information provided was sufficient to allow the lawsuit to advance to the discovery phase. The lawsuit against the Palm Beach County providers seeks damages, other equitable relief, treble and/or punitive damages, interest and attorneys' fees. It was filed by Clarkson Law Firm of Malibu, California, and Almeida Law Group of Chicago.",

        "description": "The Earth's liquid molten outer core, composed mostly of iron and nickel, exerts an electromagnetic field extending from the north and south pole that protects the planet from harmful solar particle radiation.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Patricia DeLacey, University of Michigan College of Engineering The Earth's liquid molten outer core, composed mostly of iron and nickel, exerts an electromagnetic field extending from the north and south pole that protects the planet from harmful solar particle radiation. Fluctuations in the strength of Earth's magnetic field —caused by daily changes in solar wind structure and intermittent solar storms—can impact the use of geomagnetic field models which are essential for navigation in satellites, planes, ships and cars. Magnetic field models differ based on the location of data collection—either on or near the Earth's surface or low Earth orbiting satellites. Past research has attributed model differences to space weather activity levels, but a recent analysis of six years of Earth and satellite magnetic field models found model discrepancies are also driven by modeling errors rather than geophysical phenomena alone. The results are published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics . The University of Michigan research team assessed differences between observations from the Swarm mission's low-Earth orbit satellites and a Earth magnetic field model, the thirteenth generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field or IGRF-13 . They focused on differences during low to moderate geomagnetic conditions which encompasses 98.1% of the time between the years 2014 and 2020. Satellite observations collected at different locations above Earth are sensitive to magnetic field fluctuations, whereas Earth magnetic field models use observations to estimate the Earth's internal magnetic field without accounting for the influence of solar storms. Internal magnetic field models like IGRF-13 are used to track changes in the Earth's magnetic poles , like the North pole's shift of about 45 km north-northwest each year. Understanding these large differences are important for satellite operation when using IGRF-13 as a reference and for research on the physics of the Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere. Model uncertainty was highest in the north and south polar regions , and a statistical analysis revealed that the asymmetry between the north and south polar regions was a major factor driving model differences. \"We often assume a nearly symmetrical magnetic field between the northern and southern polar regions, but they are actually very different,\" said Yining Shi, an assistant research scientist at the University of Michigan Climate and Space Science and Engineering and corresponding author on the study. The two geographic poles map to different geomagnetic coordinates. The North pole maps to around 84° Magnetic Latitude (MLAT) and 169° Magnetic Longitude (MLON) and the South pole maps to around −74° MLAT and 19° MLON. The Swarm satellites' polar orbit track creates a sampling bias with a high concentration of measurements around the geographic poles, which exacerbates the model differences. \"Understanding that what has been attributed to geophysical disturbances is really due to the asymmetry of the Earth's magnetic field will help us better create geomagnetic field models as well as help with satellite and aviation navigation,\" said Mark Moldwin, an Arthur F Thurnau Professor of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at U-M and an author on the study. Another issue that is causing the navigation community concern, is that the polar magnetic field has been changing rapidly over the past decade or so. \"This adds further complexity to creating accurate magnetic field models,\" said Moldwin.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by University of Western Australia A team of researchers created a new method of modeling to estimate the population of free-ranging animals and in doing so discovered that there were far fewer numbers of an Old World monkey, the macaque, than expected. Ph.D. candidate Xueying Zhu, from The University of Western Australia 's School of Human Sciences, was co-author of the paper published in Science Advances . Zhu said accurately estimating population sizes for free-ranging animals using non-invasive methods, such as camera trap images, was limited by the lack of individual identification, small number of areas surveyed and size of datasets. \"Tracking the movement of animals using mark and recapture methods or GPS tagging offers a solution but unavoidably disrupts the species' movement and behavior and requires a lot of scientific resources and trained labor,\" Zhu said. \"We created a flexible model and used it to estimate the upper limit of the population of the long-tailed macaque; a wild animal which is often considered a pest.\" The long-tailed macaque, Macaca fascicularis, is a primate native to Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Burma, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand, and has a long history of living alongside humans. Researchers created habitat preference maps, based on environmental and GPS data, by using a probability of distribution model and combined it with data from camera traps, line transect distance sampling and direct sightings to produce an estimation. The study found the long-tailed macaque population could be up to 80% smaller than previously expected. \"We recommend prioritizing and improving conservation measures for this species, continuing to monitor and study trends in its population dynamics ,\" Zhu said. \"Additionally, we are optimistic about the use of citizen science data and encourage its integration into more wildlife conservation to increase the availability of data.\" The modeling developed by the researchers is flexible, which makes it suitable to study many species providing a scalable, non-invasive tool for wildlife conservation .

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward creating a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died for.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

        "content": "BTS ’s RM has once again surprised fans with fresh beats and candid lyrics in his latest music video ! Just as the clock struck midnight on May 28 KST, RM unveiled the visuals for “Groin,” a track from his recent solo album “Right Place, Wrong Person.” “Groin” isn’t your typical tune. It’s an alternative hip hop piece with a rocking vibe and an infectious chorus that sticks in your head. But what really sets it apart is its honest expression of dislike towards certain individuals. In the music video, RM doesn’t hold back. Through dynamic visuals and raw lyrics, he paints a vivid picture of his feelings towards those he’s not fond of. It’s a refreshing departure from the usual love songs and party anthems, offering listeners a glimpse into RM’s unfiltered thoughts and emotions. Fans have been quick to praise RM for his boldness and authenticity. With “Groin,” he proves once again that he’s not afraid to push boundaries and speak his mind through his music. RM, whose real name is Kim Nam-joon, is a multifaceted talent hailing from South Korea. He's not only a rapper but also a songwriter and record producer. RM embarked on his solo journey back in 2015 with his first mixtape, \"RM,\" followed by \"Mono\" in 2018, which made history by becoming the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in the United States. In 2022, RM made his official solo debut with the release of his studio album \"Indigo,\" featuring collaborations with acclaimed artists like Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak. The album soared to number three on the Billboard 200, solidifying RM's position as a trailblazer in the music industry. RM's journey to stardom began when he auditioned for Big Deal Records in 2009. Although he stumbled in the audition, fate intervened when rapper Sleepy recognized his potential and introduced him to Big Hit Entertainment producer Pdogg. This encounter paved the way for RM's entry into the music scene, eventually leading to the formation of BTS. Training alongside fellow members Suga and J-Hope, RM honed his skills for three years before debuting with BTS in 2013. Since then, he has been an integral part of the group, contributing as a songwriter and producer, and even making solo appearances like his performance of the intro track for BTS' first EP. With his solo endeavors, RM continues to push boundaries and captivate audiences worldwide, solidifying his status as a visionary artist in the music industry.",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 report This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Bob Yirka , Phys.org A small team of social media analysts at Indiana University has found that a major portion of tweets spreading disinformation are sent by a surprisingly small percentage of a given userbase. In their study, published in PLOS ONE , the group conducted a review of 2,397,388 tweets posted on Twitter (now X) that were flagged as having low credibility and who was sending them. Over the past several years, media researchers have found that social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can have a major impact on personal beliefs and social issues , including those of a political nature. Prior research has also shown that because of such influence, foreign entities have been posting entries on social media sites with the intention of swaying public opinion on a variety of issues. In this new study, the research team found that it does not take a lot of influencers to sway the beliefs and/or opinions of large numbers of people. This, they suggest, is due to the impact of what they describe as superspreaders. Like the superspreaders that were labeled as such during the pandemic, superspreaders on the internet have the ability to \"infect\" large numbers of people due to their reputation. To learn more about influence on social media, the research team focused their efforts on Twitter. They collected 10 months of data, which added up to 2,397,388 tweets sent by 448,103 users, and then parsed it, looking for tweets that were flagged as containing low-credibility information. They found that approximately a third of the low-credibility tweets had been posted by people using just 10 accounts, and that just 1,000 accounts were responsible for posting approximately 70% of such tweets. They note that the majority of the superspreader accounts could not be traced to an individual, though there were a number of high-profile posters, such as politicians or generalist influencers, such as Donald Trump Jr. The researchers note that many of the superspreader accounts they identified were disabled during a push by Twitter in 2020 to reduce the amount of disinformation on the site. But that trend is now in reverse as the site, now rebranded as X, has taken a new direction following its takeover by Elon Musk. More information: Matthew R.

        "content": "Listen to Story Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge will lose his job after the Lok Sabha poll results are announced on June 4 but Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will not be blamed for the defeat, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Monday. Shah said Rahul Gandhi's people will also do a press conference post polls, saying they lost due to EVMs. The Union home minister also addressed election rallies in Ballia and Chandauli. \"I have the details of the first five phases. In five phases of the Lok Sabha polls, PM Modi has crossed 310 seats. Rahul will not cross 40 and Akhilesh Yadav will not get even 4 seats on June 4,\" he said at an election rally in Kushinagar. Shah said Kharge will lose his job as \"bhai behen\" (Rahul and Priyanka) will not be blamed for the defeat. Slamming the SP and the Congress, he said while PM Narendra Modi was born in the house of a backward, both Rahul and Akhilesh were born with a silver spoon and do not know about the problems being faced by the people of Purvanchal (eastern UP). \"They did not like the weather of the country. Rahul used to go to Thailand on leave every six months. They did not tolerate the heat of Purvanchal. While PM Modi has not taken a single leave in his tenure,\" he said. While accusing Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav of being involved in corruption, the senior BJP leader said Modi has never faced any such allegation. \"As chief minister and prime minister, no allegation of corruption of even 25 paisa was levelled against Modi while the two 'shehzade' (Rahul and Akhilesh) were involved in corruption worth Rs 12 lakh crore,\" he alleged without elaborating. Referring to the Sahara group, Shah claimed, \"Akhilesh's party used to run from Sahara's fund. The scam was done in their (SP) regime. We have ensured a refund of people's money and the process has started.\" The Sahara group firms were accused of circumventing regulations with Ponzi schemes. The group has denied the charges. Further attacking the SP, Shah claimed in the previous regime there was \"one district one mafia\" but now we have \"one district one product\" scheme to benefit the people. Shah said the sugar mills were closed in the previous SP-BSP regimes while the Yogi Adityanath government has paid cane dues to the farmers. He told the gathering, \"If you people make them (opposition) win, they will take away reservation of Dalits, backwards and tribals and give to Muslims....They did the same in Karnataka, Hyderabad and Bengal, but the HC did not allow it. Muslim reservation cannot be given constitutionally.\" \"They talk of this for their vote bank. You need not worry. Till a single MP of the BJP is there, we will not allow reservation based on religion,\" Shah said. The senior BJP leader claimed that the opposition has decided to make one prime minister every year during the five-year tenure. \"Who can give a befitting reply to Pakistan, save you from Covid, end terrorism and naxalism and do welfare of 60 crore people of the country? Only Modi,\" he asserted. He said when there will be five prime ministers in five years, the opposition will again implement Article 370, bring back instant triple talaq and start talking to the terrorists. Raising the Ram temple issue, the home minister said the SP government had opened fire on Ram bhakts while the Congress stalled the temple issue for 70 years. \"Modi ji not only did bhoomi pujan of the temple but also attended the pran pratishtha ceremony, renovated the Kashi Vishwanath temple and worked towards gold plating of the Somnath temple,\" he said. Referring to Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar's Pakistan atom bomb remarks, Shah said, \"The BJP people are not afraid of atom bombs. PoK (Pak-occupied Kashmir) is ours and we will take it back.\" Shah also addressed poll meetings in Ballia for Salempur constituency and in Chandauli. He continued his attack on the opposition alliance terming it as a \"gathering of dynasts\". \"Their aim is to make their son, daughter and nephews the chief minister. Can those who work for their sons and daughters do any good to you? Only the one who has a Rs 130 crore family can do good to you, and he is Narendra Modi,\" he said. On Article 370, he said, \"Rahul (Gandhi) used to threaten him about the revocation of Article 370, saying if it was revoked, there would be bloodshed in Jammu and Kashmir. But after it was revoked, no one could dare to pelt a single stone there.\" He said in the previous Congress government, terrorists came from Pakistan and did blasts in the country and left. \"After Modi came to power, they did Uri and Pulwama after which surgical and air strikes were done in their territory,\" he added. Voting on these seats will take place in the seventh phase and last phase on Jun 1.",

        "content": "The DJ at American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, is apologizing after trolling the Oilers by playing La Bamba following Edmonton’s loss to the Stars on Saturday night. The DJ played the Los Lobos song as the Oilers were leaving the ice following a 3-1 loss in Game 2 of the Western Conference final. La Bamba is the Oilers’ victory song, which is played after every win at Rogers Place. The song has special meaning to the team and its fans, with ties to the Oilers late locker room attendant Joey Moss and the late Ben Stelter, a six-year-old Oilers superfan who lost his battle with cancer in 2022. Oilers fans were quick to call out the DJ and make him aware of the significance of the song. On Sunday, Dallas Stars’ DJ Jonathon (Shippy) Shipman took to social media to apologize. He said playing the opposing team’s win song after a loss is something he does to poke fun at the team. Story continues below advertisement “I’m sorry, Oilers fans. If I knew what I know now about the significance of La Bamba to your franchise and fan base, I certainly would not have played it,” he wrote on his X account @ShippySpins. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “I thought it was just a happy, fun win song. Thank you to all the Oilers fans who have been so understanding. Much love!” The DJ said he also made a donation to the Ben Stelter Foundation, and encouraged other Stars fans to do the same. A spokesperson for the Ben Stelter Foundation said Monday morning that the organization had received about $1,000 in donations from Dallas, with donations ranging from $5 to $500. 2:04 Edmontonians say goodbye to young Oilers fan Ben Stelter Trending Now New Brunswick premier bans sex ed group from schools over ‘inappropriate’ presentation Canada now ‘the outlier’ in NATO on defence spending: U.S. ambassador Stelter passed away in 2022 after a two-year battle with an aggressive type of brain cancer cancer called glioblastoma.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three under-the-radar growth stocks picked by the new GPT-4o AI bot could deliver massive gains if the AI model is right.The post 3 Growth Stocks the New ‘GPT-4o’ AI Bot Says Will Make You Rich appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "OpenAI has recently released its GPT-4o AI bot, touted as a more advanced version of its previous language models. This new bot is more focused on voice inputs and usefulness in day-to-day living than pure logic or reasoning. However, its improvements over previous GPT-4 models have not been groundbreaking, to say the least. That said, it is still worth exploring how this AI bot approaches the stock market. Playing with prompts and asking for different stock picks can provide some interesting ideas to research. I did precisely that on some stocks that the GPT-4o bot has picked. I asked it for more “under-the-radar” growth stocks , as it regurgitated the usual FAANG/Magnificent 7 tech giants when prompted for growth picks. Here are the three I got. MongoDB (MDB) I agree with GPT-4o that MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB ) is a company well-positioned for growth. MongoDB provides a platform that allows developers to build and update applications with greater ease and efficiency. In the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, MongoDB again showed solid execution. Revenue increased 27% to $458 million . Additionally, both revenue and earnings exceeded expectations. Atlas, their cloud database offering, remains the key driver of growth, growing 34% and now accounting for 68% of the company’s total revenue. The company added over 7,000 new customers last year across both small startups and large Fortune 500 companies. MongoDB’s earnings per share metric is very bullish, considering the 86 cents figure beat analyst estimates by 39 cents. Paying 148-times forward earnings here is definitely quite the premium. However, the company should be able to sustain annual revenue growth well above 25% for years to come, along with juicy earnings growth averaging roughly 40%. Even if this stock’s premium remains 50% intact, MDB stock should deliver significant gains over the next decade. DexCom (DXCM) DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM ) is in the continuous glucose monitoring business. The company’s G7 system, which came out last year, has already made a big impact with how accurate and easy to use it is, plus how well it connects to popular devices. In Q1, DexCom saw their sales grow an impressive 25% to $921 million , beating estimates. Earnings per share also beat by 18.6%. It’s a major positive that more doctors are recommending the G7, and insurance is covering this device for more patients. What gives me hope is how fast DexCom innovates on new products. Since releasing the G7, the company has sent out monthly updates to improve how it functions, connects to other things, and is used. Getting approved to connect directly to the Apple Watch makes this device the first CGM that can do that. With more people (sadly) getting diabetes worldwide, DexCom’s top-notch glucose monitoring system sets up DexCom well for strong growth. If the company can keep making progress like this, I definitely think DXCM stock can outperform. The stock is still down some 19% from its 2021 high. Nutrien (NTR) Nutrien (NYSE: NTR ) is another solid pick by GPT-4o. A fertilizer company, Nutrien is also a different type of bet than the other two. That’s because Nutrien’s growth is relatively muted, so a recovery is what I’m hoping for. And I think that recovery is underway, since NTR stock has appreciated 24% since mid-February. Nutrien reported adjusted EBITDA of CAD$1.1 billion , aided by improved margins on crop nutrients, higher fertilizer production meeting strong demand, increased sales volume, and lower operational expenses. The company’s agricultural retail division also saw significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA. According to Nutrien’s estimates, global supply and demand for potash appear fairly balanced. The company is maintaining its full-year forecast for worldwide potash shipments at 68-71 million metric tonnes. I believe Nutrien is well-positioned to benefit from these favorable market dynamics and continue recovering. Indeed, NTR stock seems to have bottomed out at current levels.

        "description": "\"Inflation is here. It’s real,\" Bass Pro Shops CEO Johnny Morris said.",
        "content": "The founder and CEO of Bass Pro Shops, Johnny Morris, says that despite inflation, the hunting, fishing and outdoor sporting brand will remain focused on affordability heading into boating and fishing seasons. Inflation remains high at 3.4% , above the Fed’s 2% goal, though it dropped from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. “Inflation is here. It’s real,” Morris told FOX Business during a video interview. In April, energy prices rose for the third month in a row, and the cost of gas increased by 2.8%, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI). Bass Pro Shops ended an inflation buster savings program in late 2023, but the brand maintains its promise to work with consumers on belt-tightening opportunities to combat elevated inflation burning holes through American’s pockets. “We worked hard, and we still focus on affordability,” Morris said of starting Bass Pro decades ago. Bass Pro Shops offers consumers payment plans as low as $5 and $10 per day to make the dream of owning a boat a reality for just about anyone. “My dad was big on delivering value to customers,” Morris said. “One of his sayings to me every day was, ‘Johnny, it’s not worth any more on your shelf than it is your competitors.’” Morris, a Missouri native, proudly referred to a framed advertisement of the original Bass Pro Shops boat, a Bass Tracker, hanging behind him that retailed for $2,995. “We broke through by delivering remarkable value to fishermen and to anglers,” he said. “That’s something that we’re focused on. We build boats right here in the Ozarks — most of them — sell them direct, and we have a few great select dealers.’” The company was founded by Morris in 1972, when he was just 21 years old and gas cost 36 cents a gallon, or $2.53 today when adjusted for inflation. “I approached my dad about stocking fishing tackle in a liquor store he had on the way to the lake,” Morris said. “We called it Bass Pro. Every nickel we could get, we put it into this fishing gear.” Morris, a dedicated leader in conservation, credits his father, John A. Morris, founder of Walmart, Sam Walton, former President Theodore Roosevelt and naturalist John James Audubon for not only his approach to consumer-driven business strategies but his ability to preserve a healthy, commonsense harvest of “God-given natural resources.” Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter!

On Saturday, Morris unveiled Thunder Ridge Nature Arena, an outdoor amphitheater on 1,200 acres near Table Rock Lake, just outside of Branson, Missouri. The grand opening was packed with thousands of attendees and starred country music A-lister Morgan Wallen. The venue is planned to host Chris Stapleton and Luke Bryan, among other celebrities, later this summer. In July, the Rolling Stones will end their summer tour at Thunder Ridge. Thunder Ridge, dedicated to celebrating the natural beauty of the Ozarks, teamed up with Live Nation and ASM Global to execute the day-to-day operations of the space for 18,000-20,000 people. “I think one thing that people can expect is getting their money’s worth here in the Ozarks,” Morris said. “And they can expect genuine, friendly service in this region.” Morris is a vocal advocate for conservation, and designed the amphitheater oasis to highlight the rich history and unmatched views of the Ozarks. “The economy is what it is, but I think people can expect good value here,” Morris said.",

The data also showed a 6.4% uptick in aircraft movements over the same period. The 12.2% rise in passenger traffic was recorded across all commercial airports in Greece (39 airports: 24 managed by HCAA, 14 by FRAPORT GREECE, and Athens International Airport).

        "description": "For more than 50 years, Scott Snyder's family has grazed cattle on a 600-acre parcel of leased land on Wright's Mesa, a 7,000-foot plateau ringed by southwestern Colorado's San Juan Mountains.",
        "content": "For more than 50 years, Scott Snyder's family has grazed cattle on a 600-acre parcel of leased land on Wright's Mesa, a 7,000-foot plateau ringed by southwestern Colorado's San Juan Mountains. In the spring, the family brings cows and their new calves to the sunny, level parcel of sagebrush plain and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Their bulls winter on the land, close to their ranch headquarters outside Norwood. At first, the Snyders weren't too worried when a clause appeared in their lease with the Colorado State Land Board. It said their use of the parcel would be terminated if the county government approved a solar project on the land. \"Then it kind of snowballed and caught fire,\" Snyder said. That parcel is now the proposed site for a large solar farm that is opposed by Snyder and many in neighboring Norwood who don't want on the beautiful, tranquil mesa. The opposition prompted San Miguel County to enact a moratorium on large solar development—one of several such temporary local bans across Colorado. The fast expansion of large-scale solar projects, fueled in part by record federal investment, has prompted a wave of county governments to pass moratoriums on the construction of new facilities, often in response to local opposition. In the last two years, at least 10 counties in the mountains and on the Eastern Plains put temporary halts in place. More than 40% of the state's 4,112 megawatts of installed solar power were built last year, the vast majority from utility-scale projects. Solar facilities now provide 9% of the state's electricity and generate enough energy to power more than 838,000 homes, according to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association. But to meet Gov. Jared Polis' goal of using 100% clean energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the amount of will need to quintuple, according to . To reach that level, companies will need to roll out large-scale solar facilities, which require sunny tracts of land that are broad, flat, cleared of trees and close to transmission lines. Land meeting all of those criteria can be found in on the Western Slope, but some oppose giving up agricultural land—and ceding land with a cherished undeveloped nature. Snyder isn't opposed to solar. He's attempted to lease other parcels he owns on the west side of San Miguel County to solar companies. But he questions why this project should go here, in his backyard, on the land he's grazed since he was in middle school. Across the state, few of the local opposition movements to solar projects are about party politics or the concept of solar energy, said Mike Kruger, the CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association. Instead, they're typically about local concerns, he said, and NIMBYism, which stands for \"not in my backyard.\" \"The reactions are: 'I love solar, I just don't love it here,'\" he said. \"Congratulations, hillbillies.\" The solar proposal outside of Norwood would build panels on approximately 600 acres across three parcels of private land and the state land trust parcel leased by the Snyder family. The solar company, OneEnergy, is in talks with power supplier Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to sell the electricity produced by the facility, according to the project website. Cattle can't graze land used for solar, but the company has said it would allow sheep to graze the land. Once the project has reached its end, the company said all the land would be returned to agricultural use. A town meeting with company representatives last year featured strong resistance from everyone in attendance, Norwood Mayor Candy Meehan said. It was the largest meeting in the town's recorded history, she said. \"They came in like it was already a done deal, like: 'Congratulations, hillbillies. Here's how it's going to be,'\" Meehan said. \"It didn't respectfully take into consideration the nuances of our community as a whole.\" Residents of Norwood, population 536, are not opposed to solar and recognize the need for renewable energy, Meehan said. But they do oppose industrial development in their small, rural town, which is about 33 miles northwest of Telluride, the larger resort town that serves as the county seat. Construction alone would be a major disruption for Norwood, which has three full-time emergency medical workers and a grocery store the size of a large convenience store. \"We live where we live for a reason—we like the land the way it is,\" the mayor said. In response to the outcry on Wright's Mesa, San Miguel County in May 2023 enacted a six-month moratorium on all commercial and utility solar permitting to allow time to update its regulations. Twice, county commissioners have voted to extend the moratorium, which now lasts until November 15. The opposition and resulting county moratorium have pushed back the timeline of the Wright's Mesa project by at least two years. OneEnergy had hoped to begin construction in early 2024, said Nathan Stottler, its associate director for project development. Now the earliest likely would be in 2026—if the county's new code is workable for the project. \"The county, much to their credit, are being very careful and thorough in drafting their code,\" he said. A slew of moratoriums As of November, 39 Colorado counties had adopted detailed solar land-use regulations, according to a report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden. Other counties did not have solar regulations, had non-specific solar rules or were under a solar development moratorium. \"The cumulative effect is a wide variety of potential regulations for utility-scale solar in Colorado,\" the report states. A patchwork of county permitting processes and requirements can frustrate developers working on multiple projects in the state, Kruger said, but it's ultimately workable if the rules don't change. \"What we can't have, from an industry perspective,\" he said, \"is have developers do all the work and then the community objects to the project—then the county commissioners go back and rewrite the rules.\" As of October, 143 utility-scale solar projects have been built in Colorado, within 28 of its 64 counties, according to a report by NREL. Combined, they produce about 1,900 megawatts of electricity. But at least 505 megawatts' worth of potential large solar projects have been killed or delayed since 2018, at least in part because of community pushback, according to a Denver Post analysis. The details of the proposed projects vary, but many communities faced with the potential of a large-scale solar farm as a neighbor voice similar concerns: aesthetics, reduced property values, the loss of agricultural land and a shift away from traditional rural culture. In other places, projects were able to proceed despite residents' original concerns. \"Most communities that we engage with, we can find solutions,\" Kruger said. A proposed 472-acre solar farm five miles east of Delta faced vehement opposition when it began the permitting process in 2021. Delta County commissioners at first denied the 80-megawatt facility, called the Garnet Mesa Solar Farm. Months later, the commissioners reconsidered, in part because the developers agreed to continue irrigating the land and allow about 1,000 sheep to graze under the panels. In August 2022, the commissioners approved the project. But the ordeal prompted them to enact a moratorium on new solar development from September 2022 to September 2023. Moratoriums don't necessarily result in regulations that are hostile to solar. Mesa County commissioners on April 22 approved new solar rules that \"won praise from nearly all sides of the issue,\" according to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. The importance of personal property rights and the right to build solar on private property seemed to resonate with the commissioners, said Tom McCloskey, a volunteer with Western Colorado Alliance who advocated on the new regulations. \"People talk game about personal rights and what we can and can't do, but then sometimes people impose things that are the opposite of what they stand for,\" he said. Colorado not alone Colorado is not the only state where local governments hold great sway over the future of utility-scale solar and other renewables. At least 15% of counties across the country have enacted regulations that permanently or temporarily halt the development of utility-scale renewables, an investigation by U.S. Today found. \"In nearly every state, local governments have enacted laws and regulations to block or restrict renewable energy facilities, and/or local opposition has resulted in the delay or cancellation of particular projects,\" according to a study published in May 2023 by the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Local impediments to solar have prompted some states to enact laws restricting local jurisdictions' power over the issue. The New York legislature in 2020 transferred permitting power for large-scale solar and wind projects from counties to the state Office of Renewable Energy Siting. Michigan and Illinois passed similar laws. A Colorado state senator considered pursuing such a measure here, then opted to introduce a bill that will direct state resources to local governments instead of attempting to supersede their authority. Senate Bill 212, signed into law Tuesday by Polis, directs the state to provide technical support for the development of renewable energy, establish best practices to minimize impacts to wildlife and create a library of model regulations. Sen. Chris Hansen, a Denver Democrat and primary sponsor of the bill, said he would be watching the rollout of local solar policies. \"By and large, Colorado has done a good job of getting this done at the local level,\" Hansen said, citing Weld County as an example of a county with a productive solar code. To reduce the risk of local opposition, solar companies need to work with local communities earlier in the process and develop plans with community feedback in mind, said Larry Susskind, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies negotiations surrounding renewable energy siting. The old method of creating a plan without input, and then defending it from opposition, sows mistrust, he said. It results in delays—and, sometimes, the failure to gain approval—further slowing the clean-energy transition. \"If you've already made all the decisions that are going to adversely affect people without them having a say, that's undoubtedly going to lead to local opposition, no big surprise!\" Susskind said. \"It's not about NIMBY, it's about trust.\" He said companies should also enter into legal agreements with local communities in which they lay out how they will mitigate any negative effects from their projects, such as the loss of property value or open space. \"If the gains to the gainers outweigh the losses to the losers, it's OK to go ahead—too bad for the losers,\" he said. \"That's the logic now and it's not OK.\" The old method of \"decide and defend\" no longer works in Colorado, Kruger said. As the number of solar projects increases, communities are beginning to see a cumulative effect, and the industry must shift its practices. \"This conversation will only intensify,\" Kruger said, \"instead of going away.\"",

        "content": "SINGAPORE: A Singapore shipping firm performed on Monday what it called the world’s first simultaneous refueling of a container ship with bio-methanol while it was being loaded with cargo in the port. Simultaneous loading and refueling hastens a vessel’s turnaround time, according to Shmuel Yoskovitz, chief executive of Singapore-based X-Press Feeders. With extra time, the ship can sail at a slower pace, reducing fuel use and leading to lower costs and emissions, he added. Global maritime transport accounts for 2.89 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, data from the International Maritime Organization shows. On a global scale, it is more polluting than air transport. “This milestone represents a significant leap forward for X-Press Feeders and the global maritime industry,” said Francis Goh, the firm’s chief operating officer. He told reporters that as far as they know this was the first such simultaneous port refueling with green methanol. Green methanol, or bio-methanol, is composed of waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and “green hydrogen”, which is created by using renewable energy to split water molecules. Compared to conventional marine fuels, green methanol has a lower carbon footprint, cutting emissions by up to 65 percent, according to X-Press Feeders. Last year, a ship was refueled with bio-methanol via another ship, but this was done offshore. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority, which supported Monday’s refueling at the Tuas Port, signaled a readiness to offer methanol bunkering on a commercial scale. The city-state operates the world’s second-biggest port and is a major bunkering hub. Last year, in a bid to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets set by the European Union, Danish shipping giant Maersk launched the first container ship running on bio-methanol. X-Press Feeders’ ship is the first vessel made in China that can run on both conventional fuel and green methanol. The company said it will add 14 such dual-fuel vessels to its fleet over this year and next. — AFP",

        "content": "At age 14, Liam Pope-Lau is already four years into development of a tool he hopes will save lives. LifeHeat is born from a chilly dip after falling out while sailing a few years ago. “I just realized how cold it was and did a little bit of research on hypothermia,” he said. “This project’s really important to me because I feel it could really help somebody.” Spurred by the icy memory and statistics on cold-related deaths each year, he set out to create a self-heating life jacket using a chemical that creates heat upon contact with water. Pope-Lau sampled 13 prototypes before settling on a version with a calcium chloride element. His project won the 2022 Youth Innovation Showcase with a $5,000 award attached to continue development. Work since then, included exploring the expertise of people with BC Ferries, Mustang Survival, and the BC Lifesaving Society. Based on that feedback, he redesigned and improved LifeHeat, to make it accessible to more people as a self-heating survival pack. “They’re experts in this so it’s amazing to learn from them, they have a wealth of knowledge,” Pope-Lau said. “As one person it’s very hard to get things done, so there’s a community of people to help you out.” Now in Grade 9 at St. Michaels University School, he recently garnered two more major awards. He won the award in the Entrepreneurship and Technology category of the Canadian 2024 Ingenious+Innovation Competition, which included a $10,000 prize, mentorship, learning prospects and a meeting with the Governor General. The money is useful as there are barriers especially for young innovators still working through school and extracurricular activities, such as sailing continues to be for Pope-Lau. More mentorships are also welcome as well. “It allows us to see where we are and what steps we really need to take to be able to do this,” Pope-Lau said. “It’s going to be amazing to learn from them.” During the event in Ottawa, he was inspired meeting and chatting with people like Christian Bagge, who revolutionized the wheelchair to allow users to rejoin activities. “People who are further along the journey are helping out the younger innovators. They know the challenges we face and they also know the ways to get around them,” the teen said. Perhaps his most prestigious award to date, Pope-Lau took home the top prize at the 2024 Blue Ocean Global Entrepreneurship Competition – touted as the world’s biggest pitch competition for high school students. He was one of four students from Canada in the Top 100 and beat out more than 10,000 students from 161 countries for first place. The students pitch their innovative business concepts to experienced entrepreneurs and business people, receive feedback on their ideas, join a community of like-minded students, and compete for thousands in cash prizes. Coming from a small Saanich school, competing against students from massive schools worldwide was an “amazing experience.” Standouts moments include learning how to position a product, both within the realm of what you want it to do, and the people you want to help, he said. “Create new markets and go into different areas nobody has gone into before, and assist people who have been out of reach.” Currently, he’s working on improvements and lab testing to make sure it’s a viable project. He’d like to try some new models, and work on ingredients to make the heat longer-lasting. “I also want to really be able to work on sourcing recycled materials,” he said.",

New Delhi : In a shocking incident of road rage that has come to light from Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow, a man wielded a pistol and threatened a person in full public view. The video of the incident has gone viral. It all started following a spat over a car collision near Basmandi on Faizabad Road in Lucknow. In the video, the man, identified as Vinod Mishra, can be seen holding a pistol and pointing it at the other person, Ranjit. Vinod grabs Ranjit’s T-shirt and hits the barrel of the gun in the man’s abdomen. Later, he shoves him towards a vehicle and hits his shoulder with the butt of the pistol. All this while, Ranjit pleads with Vinod and tries to protect himself. Road-Rage Kalesh in Lucknow UP pic.twitter.com/4ZXHuQvzfN — Ghar Ke Kalesh (@gharkekalesh) May 27, 2024 Talking about the incident, Additional Superintendent of Police Amit Kumawat was quoted as saying by NDTV, “Ranjit was going towards Bhootnath Market in his white WagonR when his vehicle hit Vinod’s black Tata Safari, which sparked a spat between them and then, the man whipped out a pistol.” Vinod attacked the man and hit him with the pistol three times, as seen in the video. The victim continued to seek apology, but the accused didn’t stop threatening him. Accused arrested, pistol seized An onlooker captured the incident from a vehicle and it went viral on social media platforms.

        "content": "London is forecast to reach temperatures of over 20C for seven days in a row, according to BBC Weather . After a rainy week, a mini heatwave will set in from Monday, June 3 to Sunday, 9 June. Although Monday (June 3) is set to be cloudy and breezy, it later warms up by the afternoon, hitting 20C by 3pm. Tuesday (June 4) will see light rains and showers at 4pm, but temperatures will be hovering around 21C. Wednesday (5 June) will be brighter, with sunny intervals and higher temperatures throughout the day. Thursday (June 6), Friday (June 7) and Saturday (June 8) look set to be fairly similar. READ MORE: TfL warns London Underground stations on two lines may be forced to set up queues on June 1 On Sunday (9 June), the weather will be generally sunny with temperatures reaching 20C, but light rain showers are expected between 6am and 11am. A Met Office spokesperson said: \"During the outlook period, the weather will turn more settled as high pressure builds in from the west. \"It will feel warm with light winds, but it will feel cooler near the coast where onshore sea breezes develop. This fair weather is likely to continue for a few days into the following week, but thereafter the outlook becomes more uncertain. \"The south of the UK will probably be drier, although not ruling out scattered showers completely. Cooler and cloudier further northwest, where rain is more likely. \"Temperatures will probably be around normal or a little above average.\" This week, however, looks rather gloomy, with rain forecast every day except Sunday (June 2).

        "content": "Image credit: (Photo by Eddie Kelly/ProLook Photos) The next three weeks is without a doubt the best stretch on the college baseball calendar. Virtually every day from May 31 through the middle of June will be chalk-full of NCAA Tournament games . Between the incredible atmospheres and high-level play, it feels like each year we get a handful of games that fall into the “instant classic” bucket. Like any other year, this year’s tournament field is loaded with draft prospects. Instead of highlighting solely 2024 draftees, I also included a handful of underclassmen. This ranking is mostly a reflection of our most recent draft board, though I did shuffle a few players around. Enjoy watching all 25 players ranked below, but especially those who will be drafted in a little over a month. It will be their last time ever putting on their respective school’s jersey and the end of what was fantastic college career. RELATED Condon enjoyed an historical season in which he completed two legs of the triple crown. His 35 home runs not only led the country, but are also the most in a single-season since the turn of the century. The 6-foot-6 third baseman and outfielder posted a gaudy .443/.558/1.043 slash line and is a near-impossible at-bat for opposing pitchers to navigate. Not only does Condon have double-plus raw power, but he has also displayed an advanced feel to hit. His operation is uniquely compact and explosive for someone of his stature. Should Georgia make its first College World Series appearance since 2008, Condon will be a huge reason why. Like Condon, Bazzana has a chance to be the first overall selection in this July’s draft. He enjoyed a record-breaking season in which he slashed .418/.581/.939 with 14 doubles, 26 home runs and 62 RBIs. Bazzana also boasts a video game-like 71-to-32 walk-to-strikeout ratio. He is a high-level athlete with top-of-the-scale bat speed and an elite feel for the barrel. Bazzana has plus power to the pull side, but he has shown the ability to drive the baseball with authority to all fields. A natural leader, the Sydney, Australia native will look to lead the Beavers back to Omaha. No pitcher in college baseball was more dominant this season than Smith, who will likely win pitcher of the year. He pitched his way to a 9-1 record with a nation-leading 1.48 ERA and 154 strikeouts to 30 walks across 79 innings. Smith features a deadly one-two combination in a thunderous, upper-90s fastball with life through the strike zone and a hellacious slider that flashed long, sweeping action with a bit of depth. He has collected double-digit strikeouts in 11 of his 15 starts, and will be the perfect tone-setter for the Razorbacks this June as they eye their second College World Series appearance in the last three seasons. Wetherholt missed almost half of the season dealing with a hamstring injury, but the third-year shortstop has made the most of his 104 at-bats, hitting .356/.500/.664 with eight doubles, eight home runs and 30 RBIs in 31 games. When healthy, Wetherholt is as impactful as any player in the sport. He has highly advanced barrel skills, and there is an argument that he is the best pure hitter in college baseball. Wetherholt has big-time bat speed as well, and it looked like this season he had tapped into a bit more raw power. A plus runner, Wetherholt can impact the game in a myriad of ways and his fingerprints are sure to be all over the box score on a game-to-game basis. Montgomery thrived in his first year in College Station to the tune of a .317/.451/.742 slash line with 14 doubles, a career-high 26 home runs and a career-high 80 RBIs. The switch-hitter has an athletic operation with plus bat speed and plus power from both sides of the plate, though he posted a markedly better slash line from the left side. Montgomery moves well in right field and his strong 70-grade throwing arm is the best in this year’s draft class. He has been the focal point within a deep Texas A&M lineup and has his Aggies well-positioned for a deep tournament run. Burns has the most electrifying mound presence in all of college baseball, and this season at Wake Forest was the best of his career. The 6-foot-3 righthander worked a 10-1 record with a career-best 2.46 ERA, and his 184 strikeouts are tops in the country. Like Hagen Smith, Burns features a thunderous one-two punch in an upper-90s fastball and a demonic slider that flashes plenty of two-plane break. Burns rounds out his arsenal with a mid-80s power curveball that features ample depth and sharp, downward teeth and a high-80s changeup that is a more than serviceable fourth pitch. He will likely get the ball in the Demon Deacons’ first regional game and will look to lead them back to Omaha for the second-straight season. The best two-way player in college baseball, Caglianone has turned in another productive season on both sides of the baseball. In the box, he hit a career-best .415/.525/.844 with 29 home runs, 58 RBIs and 41 walks to 21 strikeouts. He is an excellent athlete with thunderous bat speed and double-plus raw power. Caglianone generates high-end impact no matter where a pitch is thrown, and he is one of the most dangerous hitters in college baseball. On the mound, Caglianone moves well and flashes a mid-to-upper-90s fastball, an effective cutter and a plus changeup. His command eludes him at times, but he can carve through lineups when he’s around the zone. While Caglianone will likely be a hitter professionally, he will continue to do both as he concludes his collegiate career. After a slow start to the season, Kurtz—thanks to an unconscious two-week stretch in April—has since boosted his slash line to .313/.538/.789 with 11 doubles, 22 home runs and 55 RBIs. He also has a top-notch approach and pro-level pitch recognition skills that has translated to a ridiculous walk-to-strikeout ratio of 76-to-39. Kurtz has a tantalizing combination of plus hit and power with a fairly tight and compact operation in the box. He rotates really well in his swing and has a lengthy track record of hammering the baseball to all fields. The centerpiece of Wake Forest’s lineup, Kurtz—along with Burns—will look to lead his squad back to Omaha. Yesavage has enjoyed a career year in which he has pitched his way to a career-best 11-1 record with a 2.09 ERA with 139 strikeouts to just 28 walks across 86 innings. His ERA and strikeout totals rank fifth and fourth nationally, respectively, and every aforementioned stat is a new career-best. Yesavage has a durable frame at 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds and is an imposing presence on the mound. He features an effective four-pitch mix with three pitches grading out as at least above-average. Yesavage’s fastball sits in the mid 90s with big-time carry through the zone. He supplements the heater with a sharp gyro slider and a plus split-changeup. There is very little doubt he will start at the next level. Yesavage has the Pirates poised for a deep tournament run, although it’s worth noting he missed his conference tournament due to a partially collapsed lung. After a dominant 2023 campaign at Division-II Wingate that was punctuated by a strong summer on the Cape and with Team USA, King this spring has been one of Wake Forest’s most productive hitters. He has posted a .316/.386/.594 slash line with 33 extra-base hits, and his 64 RBIs rank second on the team. King is as dynamic and athletic a player as you will find in college baseball. He has an explosive operation in the batter’s box with thunderous bat speed. He is also a plus runner who can really go and get it in the outfield. King is new to the position, but his combination of speed and athleticism have translated well. He figures to hear his name called at some point in the first round this July. The newly minted ACC Player of the Year has been one of the best hitters in the country. To this point he has posted a .379/.494/.825 slash line with 17 doubles, 25 home runs and 84 RBIs. As a cherry on top to an already-impressive stat line, Tibbs has 45 walks to just 24 strikeouts. He has plenty of strength throughout his 6-foot, 200-pound frame and has a simple operation with plus hand speed. On top of having plus power to all fields, Tibbs’ hit tool also grades out as plus. He has advanced contact skills, is consistently on the barrel and uses the entire field while frequently generating high-quality contact. Tibbs has a borderline plus arm in right field and could be a top-10 overall pick this July. Honeycutt is perhaps the toolsiest player in all of college baseball. He heads into the tournament with a career-high .319 average to go along with 12 doubles, 22 home runs, a career-high 58 RBIs and 28 stolen bases. Honeycutt has a twitchy and athletic operation in the box with plus hand speed and above-average power. He is a plus runner and an elite defender in center field with a knack for making a big play in a big spot. Honeycutt will need to clean up his approach and pitch recognition skills as he transitions into pro ball, but his ceiling is as high as any player in the draft. 13. Cam Smith , 3B, Florida State — Class of 2024 Smith and Tibbs are college baseball’s equivalent of the “Bash Bros.” Like Tibbs, Smith has also had a career season in which he is hitting .396/.487/.661 with 20 doubles, 13 home runs and 48 RBIs. He has a big league frame at 6-foot-3 and 224 pounds and has a quiet, simple setup in the box with a minimal load and plus bat speed. Smith’s approach and contact skills have improved year-over-year, which is an encouraging sign. He has plus power to all fields and with an ever-improving hit tool, there is a lot to like offensively. Smith at third base has a plus arm and solid range in either direction. He is a slam dunk to stick at the position and has top-20 overall upside in this year’s draft. Benge has enjoyed an outstanding season for Oklahoma State. He is hitting .342/.451/.680 with 42 extra-base hits—including 17 home runs—and 62 RBIs. He is a wiry athlete who has a bit of a noisy operation in the box with a big barrel tip, but he has lightning-quick hands and consistently gets in a good position to hit. Benge has a plus arm in right field where he is a strong defender. He plays the game hard and at one speed, and it is abundantly clear that he loves to play. Should the Cowboys make just their second College World Series since 1999, Benge will be a key reason why. A 6-foot-6 Adonis, LaViolette has in the midst of a more productive season than his freshman year in which he had 33 extra-base hits and 63 RBIs. The star sophomore is currently hitting .321/.450/.796 with 15 doubles, 28 home runs and 73 RBIs. LaViolette has minimal movement in his operation, and does a nice job of creating natural loft in his swing. He has plus raw power to all fields, including double-plus to the pull side. The impact he generates is incredibly impressive. There is an argument to be made that he is the favorite to be selected first overall in 2025. Along with Braden Montgomery, the Aggies boast two of the most formidable sluggers in the country in their lineup. The ACC Freshman of the Year — and likely National Freshman of the Year — exploded onto the scene in 2024, posting a .379/.506/.801 slash line with 14 doubles, 23 home runs and 65 RBIs. His 23 long balls are a new Georgia Tech freshman single-season record, and he leads all freshmen in a whopping six different statistical categories. Burress has an unbelievably explosive operation in the box with high-end bat speed, and his plate coverage with power is remarkable. He also has an advanced approach and high-level pitch recognition skills that have translated to an overall chase rate under 20% and a walk-to-strikeout ratio of 52-to-34. Defensively, Burress has shown well in center field where he has a plus arm. He has a host of tools packed into his 5-foot-9 frame and has 1:1 upside in 2026. The reigning ACC Freshman of the Year carried over his success from 2023 into 2024. Cannarella is currently hitting .342/.422/.560 with 16 doubles, a career-high nine home runs and 51 RBIs — also a career-high. He has an ultra-twitchy, athletic operation in the box with quick hands and above-average bat speed. Cannarella has plus bat-to-ball skills and is consistently on the barrel while using the entire field. He is also an impact defender in centerfield, where he boasts a quick first step with advanced baseball sense. Cannarella’s competitiveness is infectious, and he will look to avenge last year’s early Clemson exit. Moore has been the catalyst within a loaded Tennessee lineup to the tune of a .386/.452/.801 slash line with 16 doubles, 63 RBIs and a new Tennessee single-season record 28 home runs. He has an ultra-physical build at 6-foot-1 and 210 pounds, and this year has flashed plus power and added impact. Moore defends well at second base where he has an above-average arm. Moore, Burke and Billy Amick make for one of the most formidable middle of the orders in the sport. That trio has what it takes to carry the Vols’ back to Omaha. Christian Moore hit a 441-foot homer yesterday 😳 On Friday, we picked the @Vol_Baseball star as a potential postseason breakout and MLB Draft riser... https://t.co/uzQt0eMESd pic.twitter.com/B9jSILvosi The reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year has already upstaged his 2023 campaign and enters the tournament with a .352/.447/.644 slash line with 11 doubles, a career-high 18 home runs and 49 RBIs. Taylor has a strong base in the box with no shortage of bat speed and an above-average feel to hit. He has plus power, and most importantly he is able to get to it consistently in games. Taylor routinely generates big-time impact and is one of the best bats in the 2025 draft class. Bremner this spring cemented himself as one of the premier starting pitchers in college baseball. He posted a perfect 11-0 record with a 2.63 ERA and 96 strikeouts to just 19 walks in 82 innings. He has a lean, athletic build at 6-foot-2 and 180-pounds. Bremner has an easy, under control operation with present arm speed. His fastball sits in the 93-96 range while topping out at 98. It has big-time run and ride through the zone and is at its best when located in the top-half of the zone. Between its velocity and shape, it is currently a plus pitch. He boasts two quality secondary offerings in a mid-80s changeup and low-80s slider. Bremner’s changeup is the more polished of the two, but his slider has tons of potential and took a major step forward this spring. He’s arguably the best pitcher right now in the 2025 draft class. Following a modest freshman campaign, Arnold this season emerged as one of the best starting pitchers in the country regardless of class. The 6-foot-1 southpaw has pitched his way to a 10-3 record with a 2.45 ERA and 134 strikeouts to only 20 walks in 88.1 innings. His ERA ranks eighth nationally, while his strikeouts rank fifth. Arnold attacks from a low-three quarter slot and primarily throws a fastball and a slider. His heater has been up to 97 and explodes out of his low arm slot, and is at its best when elevated to the arm side. It features plenty of natural running life and has worked an impressive 33% miss rate. Arnold’s plus slider is long in shape with plenty of sweeping life. With a strong finish to this season and continued success next year, Arnold could end up as the first college arm drafted in 2025. Following a fantastic 2023 season at Clemson, Amick entered the transfer portal and eventually committed to Tennessee. He has had a mighty productive season in Knoxville, and is hitting .318/.388/.657 with 12 doubles, a career-high 18 home runs and 50 RBIs. Amick has a quiet, yet explosive operation in the box with no wasted movement in his swing. He is barrel-chested and would not look out of place on an NFL field. Amick boasts plus bat speed with plus power, and he has routinely shown the ability to back spin the baseball with ease to all fields. He does a great job of extending through the baseball and really finishing his swing. Amick has held his own over at third where he has a slightly above-average arm. Along with Jac Caglianone, White is arguably the most famous name in college baseball. White hasn’t quite matched his level of production from last year, though he still has had a strong 2024 season in which is hitting .337/.411/.675 with 11 doubles, 24 home runs for the second-straight year and 69 RBIs. His 75 career home runs are a new 21st century record. White moves well in the batter’s box, where he is an underrated athlete. He has lightning-quick hands and drives the baseball with authority to the opposite field perhaps unlike any other hitter in the country. In addition to his plus power, White has an advanced feel for the barrel and consistently generates high-quality contact. He has a knack for coming up with a big hit when the lights are at their brightest, and will look to again lead the Tigers to a deep tournament run. DeBarge this season picked up right where he left off in 2023, and has posted a .361/.429/.723 slash line with 17 doubles, 21 home runs and 67 RBIs. He has set new career-highs in almost every statistical category, and has seen his draft stock steadily ascend throughout the season. DeBarge plays bigger than his 5-foot-9, 175-pound frame suggests and is an outstanding athlete both in the field and in the batter’s box. He has a strong swing with plus bat speed, plus barrel skills and above-average power to the pull side. DeBarge is also a plus runner, and his skill set enables him to impact the game in a number of different ways. After a stellar start to the season, Santucci did not enjoy the same success in ACC play. Even so, he heads into the postseason with a career-best 3.54 ERA with a career-high 86 strikeouts across 56 innings. Santucci’s fastball has been up to 97 with riding life through the zone. It’s most effective—and generates the most swing-and-miss—when located in the top-half of the strike zone. He has below-average command of the offering, though. Refining it will be key once he gets into pro ball. Santucci supplements his heater with a plus mid-80s slider of which he has an advanced feel. He varies its shape well. Against righthanded hitters it will take on more of a gyro look. Against lefthanded hitters it is longer and sweepier. Santucci throws it sparingly, but he also will flash a borderline plus changeup that has late tumbling life. Waldschmidt this year exploded onto the scene and has been Kentucky’s best hitter. The third-year outfielder has set new career-highs in virtually every statistical category. He heads into the tournament with a .357/.487/.654 slash line 16 doubles, 13 home runs, 42 RBIs and 23 stolen bases. He has an ultra-explosive, athletic operation with comfortably plus bat speed, and an engaged lower-half. Waldschmidt has a tantalizing, yet underrated hit-power combination. He has plus pitch recognition skills and an advanced approach. He seldom expands the strike zone and his overall chase rate is under 20%. With plus power to go along with a plus hit tool, there is plenty to like about Waldschmidt’s profile. He could be selected this July as high as the first round.",

        "description": "As consumers are more commonly using buy now, pay later programs to purchase big-ticket items, companies have new consumer protections they must follow.",
        "content": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday in a new rule that buy now, pay later companies must provide consumers with the same legal rights and protections as credit card lenders. That includes the right to demand a refund and to dispute transactions. The agency began an inquiry into the short-term lending industry two years ago, and it issued the rule in response to ongoing consumer complaints, it said. Here's what you need to know. What's behind the new regulation? Buy now, pay later loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, or low interest, and allow consumers to spread out payments for purchases over several weeks or months. They’re marketed as a way to buy expensive products and services over time, and the service is typically offered at checkout for online shopping. It’s often used for big-ticket items, like furniture, clothes and airline tickets. In a report , the CFPB found that more than 13% of buy now, pay later transactions involved a return or dispute, and, in 2021, people disputed or returned $1.8 billion in transactions at the five companies surveyed. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. How is the industry responding to the rule? Two major buy now, pay later players — Affirm and Klarna — say they welcomed the regulation. “We are encouraged that the CFPB is promoting consistent industry standards, many of which already reflect how Affirm operates, to provide greater choice and transparency for consumers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Affirm currently offers “dispute and error resolution assistance,” the spokesman added. Company News Americans cutting back spending on nonessential items at major retailers Justin Boggs 8:34 AM, May 23, 2024 A spokesperson for Klarna said the company also already investigates consumer disputes and covers related refunds. The agency's announcement is a “significant step forward” in regulating the buy now, pay later industry, Klarna said in a statement. It said it has been calling for regulatory oversight “over many years.” While some in the industry have voluntarily chosen to operate at the standard now mandated by the CFPB's new rule, there remain significant differences between credit card lending and buy now, pay later loans. For instance, buy now, pay later lenders do not all report their loans to the three major credit bureaus. Some analysts have said this can lead consumers to overextend themselves or take on more debt than they can manage or afford. What rights do consumers have? The CFPB said that buy now, pay later lenders need to extend many of the same rights and protections as classic credit card providers. “Importantly, these cover dispute and refund rights,” the agency said. The agency clarified that, with its new rule, buy now, pay later lenders must: - Investigate disputes. Lenders must also pause payment requirements during the investigation and sometimes must issue credits. - Refund returned products or canceled services. Buy now, pay later lenders must credit the refunds to consumers’ accounts. - Provide billing statements. Consumers must receive periodic statements of money owed similar to the ones received for classic credit card accounts. “The failure to provide dispute protections can create chaos for consumers when they return their merchandise or encounter other billing difficulties,” the CFPB said.",

Mr Martin, who worked in the library of Wheatfield Prison, was killed when his motorcycle was in collision with a truck on the M50 motorway on Friday May 17th. During the ceremony Our Lady of Victories parish priest Fr Frank Reyburn paid tribute to those who stopped to comfort Mr Martin in the immediate aftermath of the crash. The chief mourners at the funeral were Mr Martin’s wife Vanessa and children Caitlin and Reece, his parents Ethel and Derek and his sisters Michelle, Jennifer and Helen.

Throughout the funeral mass two prison officers stood in a guard of honour behind Mr Martin’s coffin which was which was draped in the national flag. More than 50 motor bikers lined the avenue to the church in advance of the funeral mass. In a eulogy, Mr Martin’s best friend Noel Kelly said Mr Martin was very close to his three sisters, and his parents Derek and Ethel. He credited Mr Martin’s mother with saving Derek’s life by encouraging him to lose weight. In recent years Mr Martin had lost half his body weight, Noel said. He said Mr Martin was a family man and “a big kid” who loved bringing his daughter Caitlin to Disney theme parks and his son Reece to football matches. He said Mr Martin was had proposed to his wife “a few times” and later changed his name on her phone to “the most amazing husband ever”. He said every Saturday when Ms Martin was working she would come home “to the house spotless, fresh PJs waiting for her and dinner ready”. “Derek was a very romantic man and Vanessa was the beneficiary of this,” he said. “He was never lost for words. Sometimes his mouth might run faster than his mind – Derek had no filter at all and he never apologised for that”, he said. Tributes were also paid to Mr Martin’s work in the prison service with colleagues saying he would always know when an inmate was finished a book, and would always make sure another was ready.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal reacts after missing a shot during his first-round loss to Alexander Zverev on Monday at the French Open in Paris. Jean-Francois Badias/Associated Press PARIS — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Success.

Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.

First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus) PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",
