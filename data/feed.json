The children’s category has the same prizes, but only one runner-up. Cllr Sarah Allen, Rotherham Council’s cabinet member for housing, said: “Rotherham in Bloom is a fantastic way to highlight the positive difference residents are making not only in their neighbourhood, but to care for local wildlife and our environment. “I am really looking forward to seeing the entries that are submitted, and hopefully will get some ideas I can incorporate into my own garden.” The council said the contest would be held in a digital format, as this had been successful in recent years. Advertisement Advertisement To enter the competition, you can upload a minimum of three photographs of your garden along with a few words about what your garden means to you at www.rotherham.gov.uk/housing/garden-competition.

        "content": "Nearly half of women in the Netherlands experience sexual harassment at work, according to a study by the trade union CNV among 3,000 workers. “This shows that despite the widespread attention to this theme in the media and all kinds of government programs, it is still a widespread problem in the workplace,” CNV chairman Piet Fortuin told the . The survey showed that 42 percent of women have been sexually harassed at work at least once. They report things like sexually suggestive comments, catcalling, and unwanted sexual pictures. 17 percent of men reported experiencing sexual harassment at work. CNV found that sexual harassment is much more common in small companies with fewer than ten employees. Employees of SMEs are more likely to be sexually harassed by their boss and least likely to know where to report it. According to Fortuin, this is because small companies often don’t have a protocol in place to deal with this problem. “Moreover, in small companies, there is often an old-boy atmosphere. Like: we’re having a good time together, you shouldn’t complain like that, it’s just a joke. Victims more often feel trapped in these companies,” Fortuin said. Although employers are required by law to have a policy to combat sexual harassment, half of organizations don’t have one, according to CNV. “The smaller the company, the less protocol or policy there is,” Fortuin said. “Developing policy demonstrably works. Larger organizations usually have this and are less likely to experience sexual harassment. For this reason, all organizations must quickly develop a protocol or policy. No matter how small they are.”",

        "content": "Rishi Sunak hosting the Farm to Fork Summit at 10 Downing Street (Picture: Number 10) Ever since national service was abolished in the early 1960s, it’s been the definition of the pub bore to call for its return, usually to put some backbone into the young. Now it’s the official policy of the Tory party as it struggles for survival under the hapless leadership of Rishi Sunak. Both Britain and the United States abolished conscription because they judged it was more efficient and cheaper to invest in highly-trained professional soldiers and sailors. They deemed employing these soldiers would be preferable to training, paying, housing and disciplining large numbers of disgruntled teenagers. Hence, there were quick denunciations of Sunak’s proposal as “electoral opportunism” by assorted ex-chiefs of staff. There is presumably a crude electoral calculation involved. Polling suggests that only 10 percent of 18-to-24 year olds back year-long compulsory military service, but 46 percent of those over 65 do. The latter is an important part of the Tories’ base so Sunak’s proposal can be seen as an attempt to prevent them from haemorrhaging in larger numbers to Reform UK. But I think there’s also something broader involved. Nick Robinson asked Sunak on last Thursday’s BBC Radio 4 Today programme if, in effect, he was going to run a dirty campaign. Sunak didn’t give a straight answer, instead stressing the importance of “security”. The Tories have been presenting themselves for months as defending Britain in what they call a “pre-war situation” — in other words, in imminent danger of a Russian attack. We know now that Sunak decided some time ago to call a snap election in July. So the fact that he made a speech a couple of weeks ago devoted to “security” is significant. He said then that “the next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet the most transformational our country has ever known. The dangers that threaten our country are real. They are increasing in number. “An axis of authoritarian states like Russia, Iran, North Korea and China is working together to undermine us and our values,” he went on. Absurdly Sunak added pro-Palestine campaigners and “gender activists” to the list of threats. Enemies So here we have the Tories portraying themselves as defending Britain against enemies without and within. It was almost exactly 40 years ago that Margaret Thatcher denounced “the enemy within”, targeting striking miners. But she combined a very traditional conservative and racist nationalism with optimism about how neoliberal economic policies could transform Britain for the better. Thatcherism was summed up by the formula “free economy plus strong state”. As Janan Ganesh, the clever but annoying Tory columnist at the Financial Times, pointed out last week, Sunak “is the most thoroughgoing capitalist to have held the office of UK prime minister. “At the same time, he is enough of a stickler for tradition and nationhood to have supported Brexit before Boris Johnson did.” But, like Thatcher herself, he’s failed to see that capitalist anarchy undermines traditional institutions and beliefs. It’s true that in his security speech Sunak tried to paint a glowing picture of a future, innovative, free-enterprise Britain. But in reality, Toryism in power has increasingly used the state to prop up an increasingly shaky capitalism. When announcing the election in that rain-drenched Downing Street address, Sunak started with the furlough scheme, which was financed by massive government borrowing. Johnson won the last election promising to get Brexit done and to level up the parts of Britain that had suffered deindustrialisation. The failure of these policies is summed up by Michael Gove’s announcement that he is retiring from politics in his mid-50s. He is another architect of Brexit and Sunak’s levelling up secretary. Sunak represents the dregs of Thatcherism. Wrapping himself in the Union Jack is all he has left. He and his government deserve to be swept away. It’s just a pity that his likely successor is equally fond of flag-wa All while he's seeking a second term US government considers foreign policy options Echoes of 1968 West gambles with the future of the planet",

        "content": "Trista Sutter has insisted there is nothing for fans to be worried about after a cryptic series of social media posts by her husband Ryan Sutter . The Bachelorette star posted a picture of herself with family in Mexico on Instagram and said that she was “safe and sound”. “Geez people. Can’t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?!” she wrote. “In all seriousness, for those concerned, I’m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful. For those who’d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that. “An opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself and with the unconditional support of my family and friends, I chose myself and betterment, knowing that my stay-at-home-mom job and my kids end-of-the-school-year needs were in the best, most capable hands. “My stoic husband, who usually chooses privacy over posting, decided to share his love for me in messages that would find me in my travels. “We look at Instagram like a digital diary. Most of the time, the world doesn’t pay too much attention. “This time, he couldn’t say anything right and just about every news outlet picked up his ’cryptic/confusing/attention-seeking/dramatic’ pictures and captions.” Speculation about their separation started when Ryan posted a photo on Mother’s Day, revealing his wife was not with the family that day. “I really wish I could talk to you. Ask you how you’re doing? How was your day,” he wrote. “I’d really like to hear your voice — just for a minute. So many times I’ve called without much to say, not realising how lucky I was or how much I’d miss the opportunity if it were gone.” Ryan followed up his post with a clarification, stating that he shares his “feelings without regard for how they will be interpreted and with absolutely no intent to deceive or mislead anyone”. “Trista is fine. We are fine. We’re great. Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit. An opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family’s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us,” he added. Trista and Ryan Sutter, who met on the 2003 season of The Bachelorette , have been married for 20 years and have two children tother, son Maxwell, 16, and daughter Blakesley, 15.",

        "content": "Speaking exclusively to for his latest column for the Daily Briefing, Romano explained that Xavi’s departure as manager was nothing to do with disagreements over keeping loan signings Felix and Cancelo. However, Flick, who is set to replace Xavi as Barca manager, will likely now have a big say in what happens with the two Portugal internationals. Felix joined from Atletico Madrid in the summer, while Cancelo is on loan from Manchester City, and it’s fair to say their performances at the Nou Camp have been pretty mixed, so it won’t be the easiest call for Flick to make when he assesses the state of the Barcelona squad he’s inheriting from Xavi. Barcelona transfer decisions for Flick Discussing the latest on Xavi, Flick, Felix and Cancelo, Romano said: “We’ve had a lot of stories about Xavi and I’ve already mentioned that I was not aware of any contacts with Chelsea, despite some rumours. There are now also some stories doing the rounds about Xavi’s disagreements with Barcelona over the future of some key players. “It’s been reported that the futures of Joao Felix and Joao Cancelo, both on loan at Barca from Atletico Madrid and Manchester City, respectively, but I don’t think this made the difference with the Xavi situation, there were other topics; not Felix and Cancelo. “In any case, now Barcelona board will welcome Hansi Flick in the city and will start meetings to discuss every player’s position and future. Cancelo and Felix want to stay at Barca, but it depends on the new manager now.” Barcelona fans will hope Flick can bring success to the club after a difficult season under Xavi, but it will also surely be essential for the Catalan giants to get their transfers right, in terms of both incomings and outgoings.",

In the group with lymphoma, 21 per cent were tattooed, while 18 per cent were tattooed in the control group without a lymphoma diagnosis. \"After taking into account other relevant factors, such as smoking and age, we found that the risk of developing lymphoma was 21 per cent higher among those who were tattooed,\" lead researcher Christel Nielsen said. \"It is important to remember that lymphoma is a rare disease and that our results apply at the group level.\" She said the suggested link needed to be verified and investigated further in other studies.

Magazine column on Monday, May 20, Katona revealed that she “can’t cope” as Heidi planned to leave the “nest” for her GCSEs. Despite heading out on “a little date night in London” ahead of her departure, the former Atomic Kitten star said she is “really” going to miss her “golden child.” The 43-year-old actress told the outlet: \"Heidi and I are going to have a little date night in London this week as I’m doing some work there and I’m taking her along. \"We have such a laugh together – she’s my golden child. She’s moving to Liverpool to go to a performing arts school in the summer once she finishes her GCSEs and I’m really going to miss her. I can’t cope!\" In addition, the mom-of-five also offered an insight into her special bond with Heidi. She penned: \"She hates to admit it, but Heidi is definitely a mummy’s girl, so she’ll miss me too.\" In reference to two of her other children, Katona explained: \"Soon I’m only going to have Max and DJ at home, who will still be at each other’s throats.\"",

The cleric gave the assurance that he would always complement the government’s efforts in providing job opportunities for the teeming youths in the society, even as he expressed dissatisfaction over what he described as unpatriotic acts of some politicians and wealthy Nigerians over failure to assist unemployed youths and poor masses.",

The company's first PC Builder Competition, seen here, was held in April 2023 in Taipei, Taiwan. (Photo: Newegg) The second annual Newegg PC Builder Competition will be open to all COMPUTEX attendees to watch for free on June 7, at 10 a.m. National Standard Time, in the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Hall 1, 4th Floor, Area M. During Newegg's 2024 PC Builder Competition on the final day of COMPUTEX, five Taiwan-based DIY PC assemblers will race against the clock and their fellow contestants to build the ultimate desktop PC system. Competitors will meticulously select parts from leading component manufacturers before beginning their ultimate PC build and showing off their expert assembly skills. Earlier this year, Newegg received over 1,400 applications for PC building fans who want to be among the five contestants. In April 2023, Newegg hosted its first PC Builder Competition with five teams rapidly building the ultimate desktop PC systems by picking their parts from Newegg's key component manufacturing partners. The 2023 event was hosted at Taipei's Syntrend Creative Park, a shopping district known for electronics, which attracted a sizable enthusiastic crowd to witness the inaugural PC building event. Viewers from all over the world who have watched popular cooking competitions may see some similarities for Newegg's high-energy event. The 2024 event winner will again be bestowed with a trophy and yearlong bragging rights as the ultimate Newegg PC Builder. Also, as an ultimate reward for their efforts, all competitors who successfully build a working desktop PC will get to keep their newly built system. However, competitors with a partially built system are expected to go home empty-handed. PC builds will be judged based on creativity, proper assembly to ensure the PC is fully functional and completion time. An audience of passionate tech enthusiasts and convention attendees will witness the competition in-person as it happens. Hosts will narrate the event in both English and Chinese. In addition, a monitor will show live PC building content and provide AI-translated subtitles. Contestants will vie to set a new PC Builder assembly record by trying to surpass the best time of 36 minutes, 2 seconds from last year's PC Builder winner. The Newegg PC Builder Competition will show how easy it is for anyone to put together the parts to build a desktop PC. PC Builder is not only the name of the Taiwan-based speed building contest but more recognized as Newegg's popular and innovative AI-based online tool that helps anyone order compatible PC parts from Newegg.com and then build a desktop PC system at home at their own pace.

        "content": "By: Staff Writer May 28, Colombo (LNW): Elon Musk’s satellite internet service is expected to launch services in Sri Lanka this year on an invitation extended by President Ranil Wickremasighe when he met the billionaire businessman in Bali Indonesia recently, according to official sources. Elon Musk’s Starlink internet is now open for pre-order in Sri Lanka, with the public able to reserve Starlink by paying a fully refundable US$ 99 deposit. Starlink aims to commence service in Sri Lanka in 2024, pending regulatory approval.Orders will be fulfilled on a first-come, first-served basis within each coverage area. Starlink’s Internet Constellation is one of the biggest breakthroughs in commercial satellite history. It brings nearly broadband-capable speeds and performance using a novel configuration of small satellites that work as a constellation while orbiting the Earth much lower than traditional satellites. As stated in an official tweet by SpaceX, Musk’s spacecraft company and the producer of Starlink, the broadband service is now available in 32 countries, including some parts of the US, Mexico, Germany, France and Spain. According to the map posted by Starlink, countries marked ‘available’ will receive their Starlink installation package immediately. The map also has areas marked ‘waitlist’ and ‘coming soon’. Among the countries marked ‘coming soon’ are Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh. And Sri Lanka When entering Bangladesh as a pre-order service address on Starlink’s official website, the website brings up a deposit fee of $99, with a message saying that Starlink expects to expand service in the area in 2024. It also adds the disclaimer that availability is dependent on regulatory approval and that orders will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis within each coverage area. Starlink is a division of SpaceX that aims to provide high-speed, low-latency internet around the world. According to reports, Starlink services are especially effective in remote areas and places with little internet access. Starlink utilises overhead satellites to boost internet connections. With the purchase of a Starlink subscription, the user will be given a satellite dish and a router. The user can then set up the devices at home to receive signals from space. The dish can be installed on rooftops or in the backyard, and the router just needs to be connected to it. The setup of a Starlink home system is designed to be as simple as possible, with an Android and iOS Starlink app that can help users find the right location to mount the satellite dish. According to SpaceX, Starlink is currently providing about 150 Mbps download speed and 20 Mbps upload speed with latency below 30 ms. Musk claims that when additional satellites are launched, the download speed should double to about 300 Mbps. The first 60 Starlink satellites were released into orbit in May 2019. Since then, over 2,000 Starlink satellites have been launched, with the broadband service now being offered in 32 countries around the world.",

        "content": "Mipadayag sa iyang kasagmuyo si Andi Eigenmann batok sa babaye nga makita sa usa ka “friendly” video kauban si Philmar Alipayo. Sey ni Andi nga edited ang maong clip nga nag viral na karon “for some social media attention.” Gi-share sa TikTok sa content creator nga si Crissa Liaging ang video diin makita siya nga nakig-storya kang Philmar samtang nag atubang sila. Sa video makita nga murag mipaduol si Philmar kang Crissa samtang nagtan-aw sa iyang nawng. Iya usab nga gigunitan ang hawak sa maong babaye. READ: Andi sa chikang ‘divorced’ na sila ni Philmar: Helpppp Na-delete na ni Crissa sa iyang TikTok page ang maong video nga iyang gigamitan sa kanta nga “Weak” isip background music. Apan gi re-upload kini sa mga netizens mao nga nagpadayon ang pagkatap niini sa social media. READ: Andi, Philmar mi-postpone una sa ilang kasal human mamatay si Jaclyn Jose Sa iyang Instagram Stories niadtong Lunes, Mayo 27, miingon si Andi, “He can go out with his friends, go drinking every once in a while, and chat with whoever he wants. No harm in that.” READ: Gabby misaad nga mohatud ni Andi sa altar sa ilang kasal ni Philmar “What’s shameful is purposely posting and editing a video to cause a stir, disturbing the peace of people and dragging them into their negativity, just for some social media attention,” dugang niya. Sa laing TikTok video, giklaro ni Crissa nga wala siya makig flirt kang Philmar. Dugang niya nga naa sila sa usa ka lugar nga daghan og taw apan wala lang makita sa iyang video ang mga naa sa ilang palibot. Apan giangkon niya nga sayop ang iyang pag-post sa maong video nga na-misinterpret sa mga netizens. Sa laing bahin, mura og wala ray nahimo nga problema para nila ni Andi ug Philmar ang pagkatap sa viral video. Bag-o lang pud sila nag post og hulagway nilang duha nga kuha gikan sa ilang tindahan sa Siargao. Na-engage sila si Andi ug Philmar niadtong Disyembre 2020 og gikatakda na unta nga kaslon karong tuiga apan na postpone ang ilang kasal tungod sa pagkamatay sa inahan ni Andi na si Jaclyn Jose. Duna silay duha ka anak, sila si Lilo ug Koa.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 AirlineRatings.com, the exclusive website for safety and product ratings, has declared Qatar Airways as its Airline of the Year for 2024. Qatar Airways edged out former champions including Air New Zealand, Korean Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, and Emirates to clinch the top position. AirlineRatings.com Editor-in-Chief Geoffrey Thomas said: “In our objective analysis Qatar Airways came out number one in many key areas although it was a very close scoring for the top ten.” “The passenger reviews however scored Qatar Airways ahead of all airlines and its consistency and high standard of service delivery came through in the feedback,” said Mr Thomas . The AirlineRatings.com Airline Excellence Awards are determined by a combination of rigorous safety and governmental reviews, alongside 12 critical criteria: fleet age, passenger feedback, profitability, safety and product ratings, innovation, and future fleet orders. The Top 25 premium airlines include Qatar Airways, Korean Air, Cathay Pacific Airways, Air New Zealand, and Emirates, among others. Qatar Airways continued its dominance by winning Best Business Class for the fifth consecutive year, as well as Best Catering. Meanwhile, Air New Zealand secured Best Economy Class. Other notable winners included Singapore Airlines for Best First Class, Virgin Australia for Best Cabin Crew, Emirates for Best In-Flight Entertainment and Best Premium Economy, and Qantas for Best Lounges. Etihad Airways was recognized as the Best Environmental Airline for the third consecutive year. For excellence in long-haul travel, the awards recognized Qatar Airways (Middle East), Korean Air (North Asia), Air France (Europe), Air Canada (North America), and others in various regions. Virgin Australia Regional Airlines was named Best Regional Airline. In the low-cost sector, AirlineRatings.com awarded top honors to airlines such as Southwest (Americas), Fly Dubai (Middle East), and AirAsia Group (Asia). Vietjet was honored with two awards: Best Ultra Low-Cost Airline and Best Low-Cost Airline Onboard Hospitality. The site also listed its Top 25 Best Low-Cost Airlines, featuring carriers like AirAsia Group, Ryanair, and WizzAir.",

        "content": "Past and present fighters were invited to the Royal Victoria Hotel to mark the anniversary and swap stories, last weekend. The club's owner and trainer Glyn Rhodes, aged 64, presided over the event, as he has done the Burton Street, Hillsborough gym for those three decades. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to The Star, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. We asked him a few questions about his ups and downs at what he calls SBC Unit. WHO IS THE MOST TALENTED BOXER YOU'VE SEEN AT YOUR GYM? We had Naseem Hamed, but only for a short time. I'd probably have to pick Errol Spence Jr. He trained with us ahead of the Kell Brook fight at Bramall Lane (2017) and I remember watching him and thinking he was a boxer who did everything right. While he didn't necessarily do everything brilliantly, there seemed to be no weaknesses at all. WHO WAS THE TOUGHEST? Clinton Woods .I remember Tavoris Cloud (2009) hitting him with a left hook and it went through my mind whether I should have stopped the fight. But it went the 12 rounds. Clinton was really hard, he had some wars. WHO WORKED HARDER THAN ANYBODY ELSE? That would be Carl Wild, the boxing bin man. He used to run in the morning, he would then go to work on the bins, and then train at the gym at night. MOST MEMORABLE INDIVIDUAL? Advertisement Advertisement Herol Bomber Graham, he was the nicest kid too. He is a legend. Without Bomber, boxing in this area wouldn’t be what it is today. I owe him so much as do so many other people. It is hard to believe I first met him when we were both 16 years old. What a journey it’s been for both of us, there have been ups and downs but we're still friends. Advertisement Advertisement I have to admit that I was one of the people who advised him to retire at one point during his career yet he came back and fought Charles Brewer for a super middleweight world title (1998) on the undercard of Shannon Briggs v Lennox Lewis in Atlantic City! That's me eating humble pie forever! A MOMENT THAT TRULY STICKS OUT IN YOUR MIND OVER THESE 30 YEARS? That's a tough one. It sounds strange, but going to Muhammad Ali's funeral (2016.) I was always an Ali fan and I just wanted to go to pay my respects. Even though I didn't get in, and there were thousands of people there, it was just nice to be a part of it. WHAT HAS CHANGED MOST? Social media: when I was boxing back in the day you had to go into the pubs and clubs and sell tickets. Advertisement Advertisement Now you just have to post on social media and thousands see it. ANY REGRETS? Scott Westgarth's death (2018) - that and the other tragedies I have experienced. MOST PROMISING YOUNGSTER. You'd have to pick Teagn Stott . He has been training since he was a baby and is now in the GB squad and hopefully the first SBC kid to get to the Olympics, that's what he is aiming for. THE FUTURE? We'll keep on doing what we are doing for the next 30 years. SO WHAT MAKES SBC SPECIAL? The people in it, the boys, girls, men and women who have that special camaraderie. It doesn't matter how big you are, how good you are, we are all in it together. That's why we call it SBC Unit.",

        "content": "A royal author has said that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are trying to “take advantage” at a time when the royals are unable to conduct overseas royal tours. A royal author has said that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are trying to “take advantage” at a time when King Charles and Prince William are not able to conduct overseas royal tours. Just this month, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex went on a Nigeria tour. Both Charles and Kate Middleton are battling cancer. While the king is back to his royal duties, Kate still remains away from the public eye as she undergoes treatment. “The royals who go out have a lot of discussion and weeks of studying,” royal commentator Angela Levin said, according to GB News. “Her behaviour which was so inappropriate will slide down to affect the Royal Family,” Levin continued, referring to Meghan. “They had so much royal stuff that it wasn't just a visit.” She added, “It was Harry and Meghan trying to take over the advantage that King Charles and William can't go away. They can, and they can take it away from the Royal Family. They want to show they're modern, fun and everything else.” Levin had also criticised Meghan's fashion choices in Nigeria. “She went to a school, a very religious school, and she went with a backless dress,” Levin said. “You don't do that. I think it is very provocative. If she was representing the Royal Family, she would not have been wearing anything like that.” “I thought it was absolutely appalling. I was livid with it. I thought her choice of clothing was absolutely terrible,” she added. Harry previously spoke out about the tour, telling People, “It is hugely important for us to meet directly with people, supporting our causes and listening, in order to bring about solutions, support and positive change.” “There's only so much one can do from home and over Zoom, so we look forward to travelling more because the work matters,” he added. “Whether it's the Archewell Foundation, Invictus, or any of our other causes, there will always be reasons to meet the people at the heart of our work.”",

        "content": "Donald Trump ’s New York hush money trial enters its final stages on Tuesday as the prosecution and defense prepare to deliver their closing arguments in Judge Juan Merchan ’s courtroom. The Republican presidential candidate stands accused by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg of falsifying business records in order to conceal a $130,000 payment made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels in October 2016 in order to ensure her silence about a sexual encounter she alleges she had with the politician a decade earlier. Mr Trump denies both the extramarital affair and the 34 charges he faces and has repeatedly insisted that the case is a “scam” brought against him by his political enemies in order to keep him cooped up in court and off from the campaign trail. After five weeks of often explosive testimony, the prosecution hopes to convince the jury of 12 Manhattanites that the misdemeanour offenses with which the defendant has been charged should be elevated to felonies because they were carried out in order to subvert a presidential election, an accusation the defense denies. The jury could begin its deliberations as soon as Wednesday. Alex Woodward is covering the trial for The Independent live from court.",

        "content": "Last year, Geraldine McFaul, 55, walked all the way from her home in Glasgow to Rome, travelling 2,000 miles in six months. During her amazing adventure, she raised more than £7,500 for the school feeding charity that was founded in Dalmally. To top off her extraordinary journey, she even met The Pope when she arrived in Rome. Mary’s Meals feeds more than 2.4 million children in 17 countries across the world. The promise of a daily school meal encourages desperately poor children into the classroom where an education is the key to their dreams of a brighter future. Geraldine said: “Last summer I walked to Rome and met The Pope, now I’m walking to Malawi for charity! I’ll really be walking around my local area, but our cumulative miles will equal the 7,000 miles from Dalmally to Malawi. Mary’s Meals is an incredible charity and I’m so pleased to support them again this year. I’d love for you to join me in June because you can easily turn your miles into meals for hungry little ones! “The key thing to an active challenge is not to worry about how fast or far you’re going because every step adds up. It’s an amazing sense of achievement when you reach your goal and I can’t wait to share that feeling with you all!” By signing up to the challenge, people can take part in a virtual journey from Dalmally, the village in the Highlands of Scotland where Mary’s Meals was founded, to Malawi, where the charity served its first life-changing school meals. You can take part in From Dalmally To Malawi in any way you choose, whether walking, running, swimming or cycling. The money raised through sponsorship from family and friends will help to feed hungry children living in the world’s poorest countries. Head of Grassroots Engagement at Mary’s Meals Dan McNally, said: “We were all so inspired by Geraldine’s walk to Rome last summer and I hope that she can inspire you to take on From Dalmally To Malawi this June. \"It only costs £19.15 to feed a child with Mary’s Meals for a school year – that’s 10p a meal – so any amount of money you can raise makes a real difference to the children we feed!” To sign up for From Dalmally To Malawi, please visit: \">www.marysmeals.org.uk/",

        "content": "One person was killed and 17 people sustained injuries in Assam due to heavy rains accompanied by strong winds after Cyclone Remal in several parts of the State, officials said on Tuesday. Officials of Assam State Disaster Management Authority confimed the one person had died. Several districts of Assam were put on high alert in the wake of forecast for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall under the impact of Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in neighbouring West Bengal and Bangladesh. The Haflong-Silchar link road was cut off as a large portion of the road has been washed away due to rising river waters following heavy rains in Dima Hasao district. According to officials from Assam State Disaster Management Authority, 11 districts, including Kamrup, Nagaon, Sonitpur, and Morigaon, have been significantly affected by the cyclone. In Morigaon alone, one person died and four others were injured due to the heavy rains, while in the Dhekiajuli area of Sonitpur district, a falling tree branch injured 12 students from Usha English School when it struck their school bus. All injured students were promptly rescued, taken to the hospital for treatment and are under medical supervision. Numerous reports of fallen trees have emerged from districts like Kamrup and Nagaon, particularly in areas such as Palashbari, Chaygaon, and Boko Revenue Circle. According to the district administration, the water level of many rivers has increased due to incessant rainfall and several landslide incidents have also been reported. Speaking to ANI, Simanta Kumar Das, Deputy Commissioner of Dima Hasao District, conveyed that the district administration has closed the Haflong-Silchar connecting road until June 1. “Several landslide incidents have also been reported from various parts of the district. The rescue teams are in place. One part of the Haflong-Silchar road has been breached. We are monitoring the situation and have issued an alert message. As of now, there is no report of any casualties in the district,” Simanta Kumar Das said. In addition, numerous trees and electric poles have been uprooted, causing road blockages in many areas of the state. Amid the ongoing storms and relentless rain, teams from the State Disaster Response Force, along with police and forest department officials, are continuously working to improve the situation. Cyclonic storm Remal made its landfall in Bangladesh’s coastal area on Sunday night. The cyclone ‘Remal’ has moved nearly northward with a speed of 15 kmph over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal. According to the Kolkata Police, many areas of the city have been hard-hit by the severe cyclonic storm. The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by the evening, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday",

        "content": "King Charles is set to plant the first seedling successfully grown from the illegally felled Sycamore Gap tree in Windsor. The iconic tree was felled in September 2023 in “an act of vandalism”, prompting the National Trust to take action to preserve this piece of English history by cultivating its seeds. The first successfully grown seedling was showcased at the Chelsea Flower Show last week before being gifted to the Monarch, 75, who is well known for his love of the natural world. He was gifted the sapling yesterday (27 May) on what is known as Celebration Day – the last bank holiday of the month – and the Trust announced that it will be planted in Windsor Great Park once it has matured into a sapling. A sapling is a young tree, and it is hoped that the recultivation of the iconic tree, which was a famous spot for stargazing and marriage proposals and even appeared in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves , will act as a symbol of hope for the future. The seedling is one of 100 seeds and 40 cuttings taken from the 200-year-old felled sycamore. It was cultivated at the National Trust’s Plant Conservation Centre alongside the other remnants of the felled Sycamore Gap Tree, which stood next to Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, said: “It is wonderful news that His Majesty will one day have the very first sapling grown from this iconic tree. The new tree will be seen by many thousands each year and will be the first of many Sycamore Gap saplings planted at different places, in Northumberland and beyond. “The swell of emotion we saw after the sycamore was felled goes to show how personally connected we all are to our natural heritage. These new green shoots are keeping the story of the Sycamore Gap alive, and are serving as a reminder of the simple and much-needed hope, joy and respite that nature can bring.” The exact planting locations of future seedlings is set to be announced later this year. Andy Jasper, the director of gardens and parklands at the National Trust, said a new Sycamore Gap tree could be replanted in the original location if the stump does not regrow. The felling of the tree on 28 September caused widespread outrage and saw two men arrested last October. Daniel Graham, 38, and Adam Carruthers, 31, from Cumbira, were subsequently charged with criminal damage to the tree and Hardian’s Wall last month. According to court documents, the criminal damage to the tree and wall came at an estimated cost of more than £620,000. In a court appearance earlier this month, Graham pled not guilty to felling the tree while Carruthers entered no plea. The case is ongoing.",

        "content": ", Africa is the . All humans are descendants from this common pool of ancestors. Africa and its multitude of ethnolinguistic groups are therefore fundamental to learning more about humankind and our origins. A human genome refers to the complete set of genetic information found in a human cell. We inherit our genomes from our parents. Studying the variations in different people’s genomes gives important clues to how genetic information influences people’s appearance and health. It can also tell us about our ancestry. To date, very few African individuals have been included in studies looking at genetic variation. Studying African genomes not only fills a gap in the current understanding of human genetic variation, but also reveals new insights into the history of African populations. My colleagues and I, who are all members of the consortium, contributed to a . This study focused on 426 individuals from 13 African countries. More than 50 different ethnolinguistic groups were represented in the study – one of the most diverse groups of Africans ever to be included in such an investigation. We sequenced the whole genome of each of these individuals – this means we could read every part of the genome to look for variation. This study contributes a major, new source of African genomic data, which showcases the complex and vast diversity of African genetic variation. And it will support research for decades to come. Our findings have broad relevance, from learning more about African history and migration, to clinical research into the impact of specific variants on health outcomes. One of the key outcomes was the discovery of more than three million new genetic variants. This is significant because we are learning more about human genetic diversity in general, and discovering more differences that could be linked to disease or traits in the future. This study also adds details to what is known about the migration and expansion of groups across the continent. We were able to show that Zambia was most probably an intermediate site on the likely route of migration from west Africa to east and south Africa. Evidence supporting movement from east Africa to central Nigeria between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago was also revealed, through the identification of a substantial amount of east African ancestry in a central Nigerian ethnolinguistic group, the Berom. The study also enabled us to reclassify certain variants that were previously suspected to cause disease. Variants that cause serious genetic diseases are often rare in the general population, mostly because their effect is so severe that a person with such a variant often does not reach adulthood. But we observed many of these variants at quite common levels in the studied populations. One wouldn’t expect that these types of disease-causing variants would be this common in healthy adults. This finding helps to reclassify these variants for clinical interpretation. Finally, we found a surprising number of regions with signatures of natural selection that have not been previously reported. Selection means that when individuals are exposed to environmental factors like a viral infection, or a drastic new dietary component, some gene variants may confer an added adaptive advantage to the humans that bear them in their genome. Our best interpretation of these findings is that as humans across Africa were exposed to different environments – sometimes as a result of migration – these variants were likely important to surviving in those new conditions. This has left an “imprint” on the genome and contributes to genomic diversity across the continent. Our data has shown that we have not yet found all the variation in the human genome. There is more to learn by adding new, unstudied population groups. We know that of participants in genomics research are of non-European ancestry. Most available genetic data come from just – the UK (40%), the US (19%) and Iceland (12%). It is essential to keep adding more genomic data from all global populations – including Africa. This will ensure that everyone can benefit from the advances in health that offers. Precision medicine refers to the customisation of healthcare to fit the individual. Including personal genetic information could radically change the nature and scope of healthcare options that would work best for that individual. The Human Heredity and Health consortium is now in its eighth year of existence, and supports more than 51 diverse projects. These include studies focusing on diseases like diabetes, HIV and tuberculosis. The reference data generated through our study are already being put to use by many of the consortium’s studies. Next, we are planning to take an even deeper look at the data to better understand what other types of genetic variation exist. We are also hoping to add further unstudied populations to grow and enrich this data set. Building capacity for genomics research on the African continent is a key goal of Human Heredity and Health. An important aspect of this study is that it was driven and conducted by researchers and scientists from the African continent. Researchers from 24 institutions across Africa participated and led this investigation. This study showcases the availability of both infrastructure and skills for large-scale genomics research on the continent. It also highlights the prospect of future world-class research on this topic from Africa. , Principal Medical Scientist, Associate Professor, This article is republished from under a Creative Commons license.

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail A one-time Miss Australia and former politician verbally abused her husband, punched him, threatened him with violence weekly and hit him with a shoe, a court has been told. Kathryn Isobel Hay, 48, has pleaded not guilty to the emotional abuse or intimidation of then-partner Troy Shane Richardson from January 2014 to November 2022. Richardson said Hay also pressured him to apply for the lifting of a family violence order against her and made him send an email to her siblings saying \"everything was his fault\".

(AAP Image/Ethan James) NO ARCHIVING (AAP) Hay was crowned Miss Tasmania and Miss Australia in 1999 and served in Tasmania's parliament as a Labor member from 2002-06. She appeared in Launceston Magistrates Court today for the opening of a hearing expected to run for several days. Richardson said the pair met in 2009 at a dog show and were married in 2012. He described their relationship as \"all rosy\" but said things deteriorated around 2013 after the birth of their second child. On a holiday in Melbourne in 2014, he said Hay hit him in the face with a shoe several times while he was driving because he \"just didn't do something right\". She threw a bowl of cereal at him on the return trip to Tasmania and called him useless, pathetic and a c***, he said. Richardson told the court there were threats of violence at least weekly and Hay would give him lists of things that needed to be done. \"If it wasn't done properly I'd get abuse. If it was done, she'd give me another list,\" he said. \"She would often make a point of having an argument in public just to make me feel low.\" READ MORE: ﻿ Country Road undergoing independent review after sexual harassment, bullying claims Launceston Magistrates Court. (Magistrates Court of Tasmania) One of several messages allegedly showed Hay telling Richardson to \"fix his f*** up\". Richardson said he was left with a black eye after Hay punched him in 2020. In December 2021, Hay was taken into police custody for allegedly slapping Richardson for driving around a corner too fast leading to a family violence order against her. Richardson said Hay later demanded he have the order revoked and spent 79 minutes on the phone with him telling him what to write. Hay allegedly accused Richardson of having an affair with a woman he had never met. She also accused him of hacking her phone and computer, and bugging her car. Richardson said he was spoken to by police but never charged. He said the accusations left him \"broken and depressed\". Under cross-examination from Hay's lawyer Dermot Connors, Richardson agreed the end of the marriage was acrimonious. He denied having control of the couple's finances and access to Hay's Facebook account and sending messages to himself. Richardson also denied allegations payments he received to care for Hay were obtained against her will by falsely claiming she had major depression. He disagreed with the claim Hay only called him a c*** in 2021 and early 2022 when their relationship was \"very bad\". National Domestic Violence Service: 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732).

The duo grow the majority of the plants themselves on-site using ecological traditions of bio-diversity and propagation techniques from cuttings and seeds.

The independent family business, based on Doncaster Road in Hooton Roberts, opened in March specialising in ornamental grasses, hardy annuals and unusual perennials with the motto: 'No tea room, no shop, just plants.' Dean (35), who previously trained and worked as a gardener at Great Dixter, a historic house and gardens in East Sussex, said: “We are losing these small plant nurseries at an alarming rate around the country. “We need to support local and the response we've had from visitors since opening has been amazing. “We are getting people visiting now from further afield because of the diverse range of peat-free plants we offer.” Advertisement Advertisement The nursery was officially opened with traditional activities including Morris dancing, Pagan bunting and decorations, and a ribbon cutting by the previous Mayor Cllr Robert Taylor and wife Tracy. \"It was a terrific day,” added Dean. “People are hungry for good quality, locally grown plants. “One customer described us as a 'magical setting with great charm’.”",

        "content": "The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Nigeria’s oil sector crashed to 5.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2024 from 12.1 per cent recorded in the previous quarter. This is contained in the latest data released by the National Bureau of Statistics as analysed by New Telegraph yesterday. According to the data, crude petroleum GDP reduced from 6.41 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023 to 5.70 per cent in Q1’24. The data, however, showed that Nigeria’s average daily oil production increased in the first quarter of 2024 to 1.57 million barrels per day (bpd), higher than the daily average production of 1.51 million bpd recorded in the same quarter of 2023. This is an increase of 0.06 million barrels per day. The report also showed it was higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 production volume of 1.55mbpd. Findings further revealed that Nigeria earned additional revenue of $5 per barrel, given the current price of $82 per barrel, as the nation’s 2024 budget was based on 1.78 million barrels per day (bpd) and $77.96 per barrel. Regardless of the development, Nigeria is finding it difficult to get buyers for its crude oil given the reduced demand of its crude from Europe. It had been reported that the nation was still seeking buyers for between 20 to 25 shipments of its crude for April loading. The reports opined that it is a considerably weaker position than normal for this time of the month — when trade should be moving on to May’s barrels — and the prices the shipments can fetch are crashing.",

This includes the inauguration of a new exclusive check-in lobby and suites aimed at offering a private and seamless journey through Paris-Charles de Gaulle, starting in July—just in time for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, where Air France is proud to be an official partner. A New Exclusive Check-in Lobby Upon their arrival, La Première passengers will be greeted by a dedicated concierge who will promptly handle their luggage. Starting this summer, these guests will be directed to a newly established, exclusive check-in lobby. This marks the beginning of their tailored airport experience. In this space, a committed Air France team will oversee all departure procedures including check-in and luggage handling. The lobby is designed with 15 seats and two private lounges, offering heightened privacy. Additionally, it serves arriving La Première passengers, providing a space to relax after their flight, access shower facilities, and collect checked baggage. The lobby is a serene retreat within the bustling airport setting, reflecting French elegance and sophistication. Crafted by Air France specialists in collaboration with SGK Brandimage agency, the design integrates individualized spaces while maintaining an airy ambiance. Adorned in a color scheme of white and gray with red accents, the lobby features plentiful natural light and includes exquisite furniture from celebrated French designers like Pierre Paulin and Christophe Pillet. Every detail, from the meticulous stitching to the luxurious upholstery, radiates a haute couture vibe. Following the check-in process, each guest will be escorted to the La Première lounge through an exclusive private corridor with its own security checkpoint. Along this passageway, a collection of images depicting the airline’s iconic winged seahorse immerses guests in the unique ambiance of La Première, enriching their experience throughout the journey. The Air France La Première lounge, designed by architect Didier Lefort, is the epitome of exclusivity, spanning a remarkable 1,000 square meters (10,700 square feet). This peaceful haven offers guests a serene retreat, promising an exceptional experience. The lounge is distinguished by its culinary offerings, with a menu and wine selection carefully put together by Alain Ducasse and his renowned team. At the core of the lounge lies a luxurious spa and beauty treatment area managed by Sisley, the French pioneer in plant-based cosmetology. Adjacent to the lounge, new suites have been introduced for La Première passengers seeking maximum privacy before their flights or during stopovers. Each suite, nearly 45 square meters (almost 500 square feet) in size, offers tranquility and convenience. There are three suites available, with the possibility to connect two for additional space. Guests arriving at these suites will be escorted and oriented by a dedicated butler, exploring various amenities each suite has to offer, including a spacious living area, a bedroom with a double bed, a well-equipped bathroom, and a cozy outdoor patio. The culinary delights from Alain Ducasse available in the lounge extend to the suites, alongside access to the esteemed Sisley spa. The suites are decorated with fresh flowers, luxurious linens, and high-fashion finishes, all aimed at creating a royal ambiance at Air France’s hub in Paris-Charles de Gaulle. Echoing the architectural essence of the check-in lobby and the La Première lounge, the suites offer a private pod-like atmosphere. Each suite is uniquely adorned, showcasing thoughtfully selected French design elements such as Charlotte Perriand’s writing table, Pierre Paulin’s Ribbon chair, and Philippe Starck’s Privé sofa. Additionally, each suite features an exclusive piece of art by a French artist, enhancing the luxurious and culturally rich environment. Air France’s La Première service now includes a new private airport experience and access to the La Première lounge. Additionally, passengers can opt for airport suites starting at 800 euros. Coming soon: a new La Première cabin After launching its exclusive airport services, Air France will next introduce a revamped La Première cabin during the winter of 2024-25. This cabin will set a new benchmark with its industry-leading length, offering passengers five windows and the longest layout available. It will also feature up to three fully private, modular living areas—comprising a seat, a chaise lounge, and a flat bed—to provide an unparalleled travel experience. The enhanced La Première will be available on more aircraft than it is currently. By summer 2024, Air France plans to equip 19 Boeing 777-300 ERs with La Première suites. These aircraft will service routes to Abidjan, Dubai, Los Angeles, Miami, New York-JFK, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Singapore, Tokyo-Haneda, and Washington.",

This city offers an array of indigenous dishes that reflect its rich cultural heritage. From ancient cooking techniques to unique ingredients sourced from the Amazon Rainforest and the Andes Mountains, Lima's food scene is a testament to its history and biodiversity. Discovering ancient grains Quinoa and amaranth, staples in Peruvian cuisine for centuries, are not just global health trends. These protein-rich grains serve as excellent meat alternatives. In Lima, they're found in various dishes - from hearty soups and stews to refreshing salads.

        "content": "Brothers Nick Carter and Aaron Carter take center stage in a new investigation Discovery docuseries Fallen Idols . The four-part series introduces three women, Melissa Schuman, Ashley Repp, and Shannon \"Shay\" Ruth, who allege they were sexually assaulted by the Backstreet Boys member Nick. Schuman—a singer from the girl group Dream—was the first to file a sexual assault lawsuit against him in December 2022. Here are major revelations made in the series. Nick assaulted Schuman after calling her to his apartment: Allegation Schuman detailed her alleged rape by Nick in 2003 during the filming of the TV movie The Hollow . At that time, Nick invited her and a friend to his apartment for what she described as a \"casual hangout.\" Schuman asserted that Nick then took her into a bathroom and forcibly engaged in performing \"oral sex\" on her. He then called her to reciprocate, saying, \"He pulls off his pants...says, 'Now do it to me.'\" 'It was consensual': Docuseries highlighted Nick's assertion Afterward, Schuman alleged that when she declined, \"He started to get really angry and irritated with me.\" She recalled, \"As he was kissing me, I was telling him, 'I don't want to have sex,'\" but he didn't stop. The day following the alleged assault, Schuman received a text from the singer stating, \"Why did you make me do that?\" The docuseries highlighted Nick's assertion that his encounter with Schuman was \"consensual.\" When Nick's ex-girlfriend reached out to Schuman Kaya Jones, a former member of the Pussycat Dolls who dated Nick in the 2000s, appeared on Fallen Idols to support Schuman's allegations. Jones recounted coming across Schuman's 2017 blog post, where she publicly accused Nick of rape. Jones reached out to her via X/Twitter, offering to talk over the phone. \"He knows what I know. He knows why I left him. So do I believe that something horrific happened to that girl? Yes, yes I do.\" Jones stated. Nick's brother Aaron also supported accusers Nick purportedly assaulted Repp—a friend of his sister Angel—at the Carter family home in Florida when she was 15 and he was 23. Following another incident where Repp asserted she was raped by Nick in front of his friends, she expressed, \"Aaron could tell that something was wrong with me.\" \"Aaron was kind to me...He didn't have a great relationship with his brother at that time because what he said were other similar events with his brother and younger girls.\" Series explored the tragic history of the Carter family Fallen Idols also sheds light on the tragic history of the Carter family—consisting of parents Robert and Jane and children Nick, Leslie, Angel, Bobbie Jean, and Aaron. Leslie reportedly died from a drug overdose at age 25 in 2012. Former pop singer, Aaron drowned under the effects of alprazolam (psychotropic medication) and inhaling difluoroethane at age 34 in 2022. Jean—another sibling—succumbed to a drug overdose at age 41 in 2023. Meanwhile, Nick has denied the allegations made on 'Fallen Idols' In the docuseries, Nick denies the allegations made against him. He questions the credibility of his accusers and declined to be interviewed for the series. Despite these controversies, Fallen Idols continues to explore both the accusations and tragedies that have marked the Carter family's history. The docuseries aired on Monday and Tuesday—broadcast on Discovery. Alternatively, viewers can stream the episodes simultaneously on Max.",

        "content": "As winter's chill fades, the summer offers a fresh chance to add warmth and style to our wardrobes. Scarves, both versatile and timeless, stand out as the ideal accessory for this season of transition. This article delves into artful draping techniques that not only provide comfort but also significantly enhance your spring fashion statement, making scarves a key element of seasonal attire. The infinity loop Transform any long scarf into a chic loop. Lay the scarf flat, fold it in half lengthwise, and place it around your neck with the loop on one side. Pull the loose ends through the loop and adjust to sit comfortably at your collarbone. This creates an effortless yet sophisticated look ideal for unpredictable spring weather. The classic drape For an elegant touch, effortlessly drape a lightweight scarf over your shoulders. Allow it to hang with equal length on both sides, or for a bit of flair, casually toss one end over the shoulder to create an asymmetrical look. This technique is especially suited for silk or chiffon scarves, as it adds a sophisticated layer to any ensemble without being overpowering. The French knot The French knot is perfect for brisk mornings. Fold your scarf in half and wrap it around your neck so that both ends are on one side and the loop is on the other. Then pull one end through the loop, twist the loop, and slide the other end through. It's snug yet stylish—a classic choice for outdoor cafes or morning walks. The belted shawl For a unique twist, transform a larger scarf into a shawl and secure it at your waist with a belt. This method not only provides additional warmth but also introduces an element of structure to more flowing outfits, such as maxi dresses or tunics. It's particularly effective on those cooler spring days when you need extra layers without sacrificing style.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in India is formulating a comprehensive plan, to build dedicated lanes for two-wheelers on state highways and urban roads. This initiative is part of a larger effort to tackle the issue of non-segregation of traffic, identified as a major contributor to high crash rates in the country. The plan also comprises the construction of pedestrian foot-over bridges (FOBs) or underpasses along key urban arterial roads. Two-wheelers and pedestrians: The most vulnerable road users Government data reveals that nearly 44% of road crashes as well as fatalities in India , involve two-wheelers. Additionally, 17% of crashes and 19% of fatalities involve pedestrians. These statistics underscore the risk faced by pedestrians, cyclists, and two-wheeler riders, who account for over half of the fatalities in road accidents. This vulnerability has prompted the government to take action to improve road safety. 'SAFE': India's strategy to reduce road accidents To address the high accident rates, the Ministry has released a consultation paper titled 'SAFE.' The paper outlines strategies that aim to reduce road crashes and fatalities, particularly focusing on vulnerable road users. Drawing inspiration from Malaysia 's successful implementation of dedicated corridors for two-wheelers, these strategies plan to segregate traffic and reduce accidents. The proposal also includes incorporating road safety into school curriculums, and organizing annual road safety workshops. Funding and implementation of the road safety scheme The road safety program is designed as a centrally-sponsored scheme (CSS), with an estimated expenditure of ₹14,000 crore. The central government will offer ₹9,948 crore, while the states and Union Territories (UTs) will contribute ₹4,053 crore. The scheme includes three key approaches: mandatory initiatives, target-linked initiatives, and state road safety ranking interventions.",

Mizoram's Chief Minister Lalduhoma confirmed that \"more bodies continue to be trapped in the debris\" in the stone quarry collapse between Melthum and Hlimen districts. Two more bodies have been recovered from the site of another landslide, while another body has been recovered from a third site, reports added.

Due to severe weather conditions, all schools, banks, financial institutions, public sector undertakings and government offices have been ordered to close. Rescue operations and weather warnings amidst disruptions Mizoram's Director General of Police Anil Shukla stated that \"Police personnel are engaged in rescue operations.\" He added that in view of the rising river levels, residents living on the banks are being evacuated.

        "content": "Polenta, deeply rooted in Italian cuisine, has transformed from a peasant staple into a versatile gourmet ingredient. This vegetarian and eggless Italian polenta pie merges traditional polenta's rustic appeal with the richness of pie, making it an ideal dish for any event. Its comforting texture and layers of flavor are sure to deliver a taste of Italy to your kitchen. Let's get cooking. Gather the following ingredients To embark on this culinary journey, you will need one cup of polenta (cornmeal), three cups of vegetable broth, one teaspoon of salt, one-half teaspoon of black pepper, one tablespoon olive oil, two cups of marinara sauce, one cup shredded mozzarella cheese (vegan if preferred), one zucchini thinly sliced, one bell pepper cut into strips, and one-half cup of fresh basil leaves for garnish. Preparing the polenta base Start by boiling the vegetable broth in a large saucepan. Gradually add the polenta, whisking to prevent lumps. Lower the heat and stir until it thickens and starts to detach from the pan sides, taking about 15 to 20 minutes. Mix in salt and black pepper. Once done, evenly spread it into an oiled pie dish or baking pan, forming your base layer. Layering vegetables and sauce Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Evenly arrange thinly sliced zucchini and bell pepper strips on the polenta base. Then, pour two cups of marinara sauce over these vegetables, ensuring they are completely covered. Finish by evenly sprinkling shredded mozzarella cheese across the top, preparing it for baking until the cheese beautifully melts and turns golden. Baking your polenta pie Place the pie in a preheated oven, baking it for 25-30 minutes. Look for the cheese to melt, bubble, and turn golden on top, indicating it's perfectly done. The edges should become slightly crispy, offering a delightful texture contrast. This crucial baking step ensures the pie achieves a golden, bubbly top that enhances its appeal and taste. Serving your dish Once your heavenly Italian polenta pie is perfectly baked, carefully remove it from the oven. Allow it to cool for five minutes before proceeding to slice. Elegantly garnish with fresh basil leaves, adding a touch of greenery. Serve the warm slices onto plates, accompanied by a simple green salad or steamed green beans, for a truly satisfying and complete meal experience.",

        "content": "The county has a longstanding tradition where the ‘tattie holidays’ begin on the first Monday of October each year, compared with the second Monday in other Scottish local authorities. Despite attempts to realign the date with neighbouring Tayside councils, these were voted down following consultations in 2009 and again in 2015. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to AngusWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Stephen Kerr , the Scottish Conservative candidate for Angus and Perthshire Glens, grew up in Forfar and has fond memories of “the tatties” and has backed an extension of the arrangement, ahead of an education committee meeting on Thursday. He said: “The slightly earlier holiday goes back to the grade A farmland in Angus and how much of an advantage it was to pick tatties earlier in the month. Families would spend the fortnight with the young ones and you’d get a dreel or two each. It was hard work, but it was a communal bonding experience for people, the spirit of which continues for hardworking families today. \"It's obviously an advantage to many, outweighing any variance with the likes of Dundee. \"So Angus Council should follow the response to this consultation, and keep the first Monday a fixture in family calendars.” Advertisement Advertisement In November last year, councillors approved a consultation on dates for all school holidays over the next three years. Some 61% of 837 responses supported proposed dates, while 38.7% did not. Parents and carers provided almost two-thirds of the responses. Council officers have advised against requests to advance the Christmas holiday, and noted eight comments that the number of mid-term breaks and in-service days were too high. However, there were far fewer responses to this consultation than the last one in 2015 – 837 against 4398. Advertisement Advertisement Mr Kerr concluded: “The drop in consultation numbers is really noticeable and that could have repercussions in future. So I would also ask Angus Council to consider widening surveys on important topics, and getting out in the community, rather than doing everything via their online portal.”",

        "content": "In a major stride toward sustainable construction, researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed a revolutionary method to produce low-emission concrete using electric arc furnaces. This method not only recycles cement but also promises significant reductions in CO2 emissions. If adopted widely and powered by renewable energy, it could lead to zero-emission cement production. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have created a method for producing low-emission concrete on a large scale, a breakthrough that could significantly impact the shift towards net zero emissions. This method, described by the researchers as “an absolute miracle,” leverages electric arc furnaces—commonly used in steel recycling—to also recycle cement, a major carbon-intensive element of concrete. Concrete is the second-most-used material on the planet, after water, and is responsible for approximately 7.5% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A scalable, cost-effective way of reducing concrete emissions while meeting global demand is one of the world’s biggest decarbonisation challenges. The Cambridge researchers found that used cement is an effective substitute for lime flux, which is used in steel recycling to remove impurities and normally ends up as a waste product known as slag. But by replacing lime with used cement, the end product is recycled cement that can be used to make new concrete. The cement recycling method developed by the Cambridge researchers, reported in the journal Nature , does not add any significant costs to concrete or steel production and significantly reduces emissions from both concrete and steel, due to the reduced need for lime flux. Testing and Potential for Zero Emission Recent tests carried out by the Materials Processing Institute, a partner in the project, showed that recycled cement can be produced at scale in an electric arc furnace (EAF), the first time this has been achieved. Eventually, this method could produce zero-emission cement, if the EAF was powered by renewable energy. “We held a series of workshops with members of the construction industry on how we could reduce emissions from the sector,” said Professor Julian Allwood from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, who led the research. “Lots of great ideas came out of those discussions, but one thing they couldn’t or wouldn’t consider was a world without cement.” Photographs of the first electric cement production in an electric arc furnace at the Materials Processing Institute, UK. Credit: Materials Processing Institute Concrete is made from sand, gravel, water, and cement, which serves as a binder. Although it’s a small proportion of concrete, cement is responsible for almost 90% of concrete emissions. Cement is made through a process called clinkering, where limestone and other raw materials are crushed and heated to about 1,450°C in large kilns. This process converts the materials into cement, but releases large amounts of CO2 as limestone decarbonates into lime. Challenges with Alternative Materials Over the past decade, scientists have been investigating substitutes for cement, and have found that roughly half of the cement in concrete can be replaced with alternative materials, such as fly ash, but these alternatives need to be chemically activated by the remaining cement in order to harden. “It’s also a question of volume – we don’t physically have enough of these alternatives to keep up with global cement demand, which is roughly four billion tonnes per year,” said Allwood. “We’ve already identified the low-hanging fruit that helps us use less cement by careful mixing and blending, but to get all the way to zero emissions, we need to start thinking outside the box.” “I had a vague idea from previous work that if it were possible to crush old concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement would remove the water, and then it would form clinker again,” said first author Dr. Cyrille Dunant, also from the Department of Engineering. “A bath of liquid metal would help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong possibility. We had to try.” Photographs of the first electric cement production in an electric arc furnace at the Materials Processing Institute, UK. Credit: Materials Processing Institute The clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated. The researchers tested a range of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina, and silica. The slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute’s EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled. “We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well,” said Dunant. “And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.” The cement made through this recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the researchers say this has little effect on performance. The Cambridge Electric Cement process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say they could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents roughly a quarter of current annual cement production. “Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we’ve also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use,” said Allwood. “Concrete is cheap, strong, and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it. We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen. “As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognize that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.” Reference: “Electric recycling of Portland cement at scale” by Cyrille F.

        "content": "The recent launch of the Arc browser for Windows has captured the attention of both tech enthusiasts and experts. Developed by The Browser Company, Arc aims to revolutionize how users interact with the internet. However, amid its rapid rise in popularity, cybercriminals have seized the opportunity to exploit the browser’s growing user base through sophisticated phishing attacks. Arc browser, developed by The Browser Company, was introduced for MacOS in July 2023 and for Windows in early October 2023. Designed to offer a new browsing experience, Arc aims to enhance how users manage web content and workflows. It features a unique interface and innovative functionalities that differentiate it from traditional web browsers. Since its launch, Arc has gained significant attention for its sleek design and user-centric features. The MacOS version had already set a high bar, but the recent Windows release has added to the buzz, marking a broader reach. Reviews from top publications have fueled this excitement, creating a favorable environment for quick user adoption. Yet, this same popularity has attracted malicious actors who have launched phishing and malware campaigns disguised as legitimate Arc browser downloads. Researchers have highlighted a fake ad campaign targeting users searching for the Arc browser. These ads mimic the official branding and website, leading unsuspecting users to download malware instead. The fake installer, named ArcBrowser.exe, operates by embedding malware within seemingly legitimate packages, duping users into compromising their systems. The malicious ArcBrowser.exe file stands out due to its unique method of delivering malware. It contains two other executables, one of which installs the genuine Arc browser to maintain the facade of legitimacy. Meanwhile, the other executable communicates with a command and control server via the MEGA cloud platform, allowing the attacker to manage and exfiltrate user data. – leverage trending software to exploit user interest. – Sophisticated malware packaging can bypass initial security detections. – Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools can be crucial in identifying and mitigating such threats. Cybersecurity experts have observed that the malware also retrieves additional payloads from remote sites. These payloads often hide in seemingly innocuous files, such as PNG images, which contain embedded malicious code. The final stage of the attack involves injecting this code into legitimate system processes, making detection and removal more challenging. The continuous monitoring of these attacks has revealed that hackers adapt their methods quickly, often using disposable emails and obfuscated command protocols to evade detection. This adaptability underscores the importance of user awareness and robust security measures to combat such evolving threats. Users are advised to download software only from official sources and remain vigilant about suspicious ads and search results.",

GFS runs from Netweather have turned yellow for June 6 indicating the possibility of warmer weather for most parts of the country. The bright weather maps come days after the country saw thunderstorms and floods leaving many homes and businesses grappling the consequences. Netweather forecasts suggest areas around Manchester and Birmingham could bake at 24C while areas near Edinburgh and Newcastle could see temperatures hovering around 18-19C. Jim Dale, a meterologist with British Weather Services told Express.co.uk that the dry weather conditions are quite possible the following weekend and the days afterwards. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) READ MORE UK weather forecast predicts soggiest summer as Met Office issues warning The heat from Spain could end up pushing towards Britain (Image: Netweather) He said: “We may also get some kind of push from the south, so the likes of Spain, Italy, and southern France will also start warming up. The warmth from these areas seems to be moving in our direction. “It does look like we are coming out of the highly interchangeable wet weather and going towards something drier and warmer, and far more summer-like.” The Met Office ’s long-range forecast between June 1 and 10 reads also confirms more “settled weather” in the coming days. It reads: “During the outlook period, the weather will turn more settled as high pressure builds in from the west. “A few showers could still develop in places like the southeast during Saturday and Sunday afternoons, but for most it will be a dry weekend with periods of sunshine. Maps turn orange, red and yellow for the coming days - indicating hot temperatures are coming (Image: WXCHARTS) “It will feel warm with light winds, but it will feel cooler near the coast where onshore sea breezes develop. This fair weather is likely to continue for a few days into the following week, but thereafter the outlook becomes more uncertain. “The south of the UK will probably be drier, although not ruling out scattered showers completely. Cooler and cloudier further northwest, where rain is more likely. Temperatures will probably be around normal or a little above average.” While humidity for June is still predicted, the forecaster hasn't ruled out wetter periods for much of the country, with meteorologists predicting more of the same of wet and warm weather experienced in May.

        "content": "PREMIER LEAGUE clubs are “trying to shift away from season tickets” and no longer want “people like me and you” attending. The 2023-24 campaign drew to a close nine days ago as Manchester City claimed their fourth straight title . It’s been another memorable season - but we all know that to witness the Premier League action live will cost you a fortune. We are used to seeing the likes of celebrities Kim Kardashian at Arsenal and Hollywood mega star Tom Hanks watching Aston Villa . And even sporting sensations such as darts teen Luke Littler have been spotted in with the prawn sandwich brigade . But another thing becoming more and more common - annoyingly so for longer-term fans - is the sight of half-and-half scarves in the crowd - and don’t get us started on the shirt begging signs! However, it seems that the tourist fan is what more and more clubs want to attract instead of the traditional season ticket holders. That is according to finance expert Kieran Maguire, who has just completed a study into the staggering price of attending Premier League football truly is. He worked, from the stats comparing the 2021-22 season to 2022-23, that the average price for a ticket, including VAT, was £45. That total price figure included the cost of corporate tickets and hospitality at each club. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S There was an 11 per cent increase within the 12 month period with Chelsea being the most expensive ticket. It worked out at a fee of £91 per fan per match at Stamford Bridge while Nottingham Forest were the lowest with an average cost of just over £21. His study revealed that Tottenham were the second most-expensive to watch at a cost of just under £85 with Arsenal close behind at £83.49. It cost £71.53 per fan to go to Manchester United’s Old Trafford while Liverpool made up the top five with a £70.79 total. Champions Man City's average was £54.02 while Leeds United, who suffered relegation last term, were the top dogs from outside of the top six. It was £44.63 on average to go and watch them at Elland Road. Season ticket prices are always a controversial subject, especially with Arsenal’s lowest for next season priced at £1,072 with Man City also raising theirs by 10.4 per cent. But Maguire told BBC Five Live that season ticket holders no longer hold the same importance to clubs - and they may soon be a thing of the past. He said: “We are also trying to see some clubs shift away from season ticket holders because as private equity organisations, they are revenue maximers.” Then speaking directly to the person interviewing him, he said: “They do not want people like you and me at football. “We have served our time. We did our bit in the 70s, 80s and 90s when nobody was interested in football. “Now that football is the sexiest thing on the planet, let’s attract the middle class, the tourist fans, the fans that will go to the mega store and the matches and so on. “I think this is a direction of travel and it’s only going to continue to travel one way.” Maguire then explained how he had been hired by the Spirit of Shankly fan group to do an analysis of Liverpool’s prices from 1992-93 through to the present day. And that led to another warning that will strike fear into supporters across the country. He added: “We’ve had freezes but at the same time there’s been significant increases in the last couple of years. “Once that becomes embedded then I think it will become part of the expectation of the owners. “They will try to put up prices each year.” STAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts. Chelsea have been given permission from Leicester to speak to Enzo Maresca . Liverpool and Chelsea are eyeing a summer move for Crysencio Summerville. Premier League clubs are targeting Tosin Adarabioyo, who will be a free agent when his Fulham contract expires next month.

        "content": "PREMIER LEAGUE clubs are “trying to shift away from season tickets” and no longer want “people like me and you” attending. The 2023-24 campaign drew to a close nine days ago as Manchester City claimed their fourth straight title . It’s been another memorable season - but we all know that to witness the Premier League action live will cost you a fortune. We are used to seeing the likes of celebrities Kim Kardashian at Arsenal and Hollywood mega star Tom Hanks watching Aston Villa . And even sporting sensations such as darts teen Luke Littler have been spotted in with the prawn sandwich brigade . But another thing becoming more and more common - annoyingly so for longer-term fans - is the sight of half-and-half scarves in the crowd - and don’t get us started on the shirt begging signs! However, it seems that the tourist fan is what more and more clubs want to attract instead of the traditional season ticket holders. That is according to finance expert Kieran Maguire, who has just completed a study into the staggering price of attending Premier League football truly is. He worked, from the stats comparing the 2021-22 season to 2022-23, that the average price for a ticket, including VAT, was £45. That total price figure included the cost of corporate tickets and hospitality at each club. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S There was an 11 per cent increase within the 12 month period with Chelsea being the most expensive ticket. It worked out at a fee of £91 per fan per match at Stamford Bridge while Nottingham Forest were the lowest with an average cost of just over £21. His study revealed that Tottenham were the second most-expensive to watch at a cost of just under £85 with Arsenal close behind at £83.49. It cost £71.53 per fan to go to Manchester United’s Old Trafford while Liverpool made up the top five with a £70.79 total. Champions Man City's average was £54.02 while Leeds United, who suffered relegation last term, were the top dogs from outside of the top six. It was £44.63 on average to go and watch them at Elland Road. Season ticket prices are always a controversial subject, especially with Arsenal’s lowest for next season priced at £1,072 with Man City also raising theirs by 10.4 per cent. But Maguire told BBC Five Live that season ticket holders no longer hold the same importance to clubs - and they may soon be a thing of the past. He said: “We are also trying to see some clubs shift away from season ticket holders because as private equity organisations, they are revenue maximers.” Then speaking directly to the person interviewing him, he said: “They do not want people like you and me at football. “We have served our time. We did our bit in the 70s, 80s and 90s when nobody was interested in football. “Now that football is the sexiest thing on the planet, let’s attract the middle class, the tourist fans, the fans that will go to the mega store and the matches and so on. “I think this is a direction of travel and it’s only going to continue to travel one way.” Maguire then explained how he had been hired by the Spirit of Shankly fan group to do an analysis of Liverpool’s prices from 1992-93 through to the present day. And that led to another warning that will strike fear into supporters across the country. He added: “We’ve had freezes but at the same time there’s been significant increases in the last couple of years. “Once that becomes embedded then I think it will become part of the expectation of the owners. “They will try to put up prices each year.” STAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts.

        "content": "THEY'RE some of the most collectable Disney items around. But Loungefly bags certainly don't come cheap - with even the smallest costing around £80 new. So it's no wonder Disney fans are racing to Asda for a new dupe that some people are labelling \"cuter than the actual ones\". Katie took to TikTok to share a video of the find, after coming across the super-cute £12 backpacks in her local supermarket. \"Disney Loungefly dupe in Asda!\" she wrote over the top of her clip . The bag - called the Disney Classics Character Rucksack on the George website - features the faces of some of the most beloved Disney characters. Alongside Dumbo, Simba and the Cheshire Cat, there's Peter Pan, one of the 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp, Pumbaa from The Lion King and Marie from The Aristocats. The backpack is done up with a zip, and has pretty iridescent silver handles. People were quick to comment on the video, with one writing: \"That is actually really cute!\" \"I just had to buy this straight away!\" another admitted. \"We need to find this tonight,\" a third commented, tagging a friend. \"How cute is this!\" someone else wrote. \"I completely forgot about loungefly and just seen they have a shrek bag,\" another added. \"I'm in love with it! \"I'm Shrek obsessed as well as Disney!\" \"Some of the Asda Loungefly dupes are cuter then the actual ones,\" someone else said. \"Literally!\" Katie replied. Loungefly started in Southern California in 1998, creating licensed fashion accessories for all ages. The company was purchased by Funko in May 2019, after a number of years trying to work out a deal. Now Loungefly is most famous for its Disney offerings, although they do also sell other licensed items too - such as Marvel, Hello Kitty and Harry Potter. Grocery inflation means we're all feeling the pinch but shopping with these points in mind could save you hundreds of pounds a year: Visit Which? to find out more. The bags are typically made from faux vinyl, with the mini backpack the most popular size. And when it comes to their collectability, it usually depends on how many of that bag design was made. However, you can tell if your Loungefly was made before the company was bought by Funko by checking to see if there's the iconic Funko crown on the metal plaque on the front of the bag. Loungefly bags released before the Funko takeover often have a heart instead of a Funko crown, and some of the original Disney ones can fetch up to £1,000.",

        "content": "Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, and Tom Rutland, Labour’s candidate for East Worthing and Shoreham, speak to activists after a keynote speech at Lansing Parish Hall in West Sussex (Picture: Keir Starmer on Flickr) Labour’s planned reform of workers’ rights has “more holes in it than Swiss cheese,” said the Unite union leader Sharon Graham. While fully backing a Labour government , Graham added, “The number of caveats and getouts means it is in danger of becoming a bad bosses’ charter.” In particular, Graham pointed out the plan was “NOT a ban on fire and rehire . Unite will continue to push for a total ban and will not support anything less”. In the latest and presumably final version of the policy published last Friday, there are rude shocks for union leaders who thought Labour would deliver measures for them to support Keir Starmer. Retain Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said bosses must retain the right to fire and rehire their workers on inferior contracts in some circumstances. Labour’s package of reforms was first set out in 2021. But the party diluted many of the policies during a meeting of the national policy forum, its internal policymaking body, last summer. The Financial Times newspaper revealed this month that Labour was further watering down parts of the New Deal for Working People in an attempt to woo big business. Upset by these leaks, leaders of 11 trade unions affiliated to the Labour Party turned up at party headquarters to meet Starmer in mid-May. A chummy statement followed celebrating that “Labour and the affiliated unions had a constructive discussion today. Together we have reiterated Labour’s full commitment to the New Deal for Working People as agreed in July.” But now—and it should be no surprise—it turns out that the corporations will still influence what happens on key issues. Labour needs the support of trade union leaders to finance and staff its activities. So it makes some gestures towards the unions. However, it is all highly limited and subordinate to not scaring the corporations. Labour promises some changes within 100 days of an election victory. But the document adds, “much of the detail will be based on regulations so we can react flexibly to changing economic circumstances”. So for Labour economic problems will come before workers’ rights. It goes on, “Where these plans require substantial secondary legislation, we will engage widely with experts and stakeholders, including employers and trade unions. “We have acknowledged that there are other areas of the New Deal that will take longer to review and implement. We will carry out full and detailed consultation.” Bosses’ voices are central to the final outcome. Promises to improve the minimum wage and sick leave have no figure attached to them. An earlier pledge to pass laws allowing workers to disconnect and not be contacted by their employer outside working hours has gone. Winning rights under Starmer will take struggle from day one of a new government.

At the WWE King and Queen of the Ring premium live event, during the WWE Women’s World Title match between Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan, Dominik Mysterio interfered, causing Lynch to lose her title. As a result, Becky Lynch invoked her rematch clause on the latest edition of WWE RAW. The promotion announced that the match would take place inside a steel cage. The show also witnessed The Judgment Day member Damian Priest questioning Dominik Mysterio’s antics at WWE King and Queen of the Ring, where he unintentionally helped Liv Morgan win the title. Priest told Mysterio that he messed up big time and that he better fix it tonight. In the main event of the show, the match between Liv Morgan and Becky Lynch showcased a lot of back-and-forth action between both stars. As the match reached its climax, Dominik Mysterio once again interfered. Mysterio opened the cage door and motioned for Becky Lynch to escape, but Finn Balor and JD McDonagh intervened, Mysterio’s actions. Amidst the chaos, , who had been searching for JD McDonagh throughout the show, entered the scene, chasing McDonagh and Balor. During the chase, Strowman accidentally collided with Dominik Mysterio, causing Mysterio to fall into the cage door and slam it into Lynch’s face. This distraction proved beneficial for Liv Morgan, who seized the opportunity to crawl out of the door and retain her title once again with the help of Dominik Mysterio. Liv Morgan surprises fans with a kiss for Dominik Mysterio on WWE RAW Dominik Mysterio, who once again helped Liv Morgan retain her title on WWE RAW, received an unexpected kiss from Morgan. After Morgan secured her victory over Becky Lynch, she encountered Mysterio standing on the ramp in disbelief. In a stunning moment during the show, Liv Morgan surprised fans by kissing Dominik out of the blue as they shared a glance. Dominik Mysterio, visibly shaken, received a laugh from Morgan. This development adds intrigue, as Rhea Ripley, Dominik Mysterio’s partner, had previously been injured by Morgan.

Wrestling has been a consistent pillar of stability and comfort, shaping the person I am today. Growing up, it played a significant role in my life, with John Cena being a superhero figure for me.

It is reported that Ahly's board of directors, led by president Mahmoud El Khatib, has also decided that fresh players will be added to their roster during the upcoming transfer window. While they may feel that reinforcements are necessary, the club's chiefs are believed to have settled on renewing the contracts of duo Mohamed Hany and Amr El Solia. It has also been claimed that a decision has been made to extend Tau's stay in Cairo, despite his reported intention to leave them in search of another opportunity elsewhere, with the player said to want a move back to Europe and also recently being linked with a switch to DStv Premiership side Kaizer Chiefs. The South Africa star has previously represented Belgian clubs Royale Union Saint-Gilloise, Club Brugge and RSC Anderlecht, as well as English side Brighton & Hove Albion. With his current contract understood to be set to expire in June 2025, the African giants are believed to be keen on retaining his services despite suggestions that initial contract talks were said to have dried up after a number of meetings were held. This news comes despite the club reportedly , for the way in which he reacted to being substituted off by manager Marcel Koller. During his time in Egypt thus far, Tau has made 106 appearances for the Club of the Century, scoring 25 times and assisting a further 13 strikes, and has also won one league title and two CAFCL trophies.

        "content": "Honey, a Delicious and Healthful Delight, the golden nectar produced by beehives, has been cherished for many years as a delicious all-natural sweetener. In addition to its delightful flavor, honey is an intriguing byproduct of beehives that offers an unexpected array of health benefits. Health Advantages of Honey: A healthier alternative to refined sugar is honey, a natural sweetener. Plus, it has a few more benefits than regular sugar thanks to the minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants it contains. The antibacterial properties of honey make it a traditional remedy for wound healing. It has the potential to promote faster healing and reduce the likelihood of infection, according to research. As a cough suppressant, honey's calming properties are useful for relieving coughs and sore throats. Compared to other OTC cough suppressants, it may work equally as well for children. Digestive Aid: Honey encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, which may improve digestion and overall gut health. Even though honey is generally safe for most people, some people may develop allergies to it. Newborns should not consume it because of the risk of botulism. A Worker Bee Only Produces About a Twelveth of a teaspoon of Honey During Its Lifetime! Highly Accelerated Aircraft: There are honeybees that can fly at speeds of up to fifteen miles per hour! Honey Keeps Forever: Honey, when properly sealed and stored at room temperature, will never go bad. Preservation is ensured by the natural antibacterial properties and low moisture content. An intricate \"waggle dance\" is the means by which honeybees communicate, directing other bees towards food sources. Flavour Variety: How the bees collect nectar from different flowers affects the honey's quality and colour. Honey contains a lot of sugar, therefore it's best to use it carefully.

        "content": "Harsh Raj, 22, was a third-year student of vocational English A day after a 22-year-old student was beaten to death by masked men on the campus of a college in Patna, police have arrested the main accused and found that an altercation over a dandiya night last year led to the attack that claimed the youngster's life. Harsh Raj, a third-year student of Vocational English at BN College, was at Sultanganj Law College yesterday to take an exam when masked men armed with sticks attacked him. The blows left him critically injured. Police reached the spot and rushed him to a hospital, where he died during treatment. \"A heinous crime took place on the law college campus yesterday. Some anti-social elements beat up a student, Harsh Raj, so badly that he died later. We formed a Special Investigation Team. We have now arrested the main accused, who planned the attack. His name is Chandan Yadav, a final-year student of Patna college. He has admitted to the crime and we are working to catch the other accused,\" City SP (East) Bharat Soni told the media. Police said the attack was triggered by an altercation at a dandiya event during Dussehra last year. \"There was a fight between two groups and the tension persisted. This led to the planning of this attack. This is a clear case under Section 302 (murder),\" the senior police officer said. The officer said the Dussehra night altercation was followed by several heated exchanges. The accused has said \"his ego was hurt\", Mr Soni said. Chilling visuals from the campus show the attackers repeatedly hit the victim with sticks. A police case has been registered and police are examining CCTV footage from the campus to identify the accused. Bihar minister Ashok Choudhary has posted a photo of himself and Harsh and said no amount of criticism of the attack is enough. \"I am in touch with the authorities regarding this incident. Those guilty will be arrested soon,\" the JDU leader said, adding that the government is with the family in this crisis. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The Opposition has slammed the Nitish Kumar-led BJP-JDU government over the incident. \"This is very unfortunate. The law and order situation is worsening by the day ever since the NDA government was formed. They have no control on the administration. The guilty must be arrested at the earliest and face strict punishment,\" Leader of the Opposition, RJD's Tejashwi Yadav said. Targeting the BJP, he said, \"If this had happened in our term, they would have hit the streets and shouted 'jungleraj'. Where are they now? What are they doing?\"",

        "content": "MIKE Brewer has teased the restoration of the \"ultimate muscle car\" on Wheeler Dealers' Australian tour. The star revealed that his team had dubbed the motor \"Bruce\" and would be \"taking it to the gym\", despite a warning from his wife. In a clip posted to X , Mike said: \"Tonight is the next episode of the brand new series of Wheeler Dealers' world tour . \"It's the first of our Australian episodes, we're really excited about it. \"We went and got the ultimate '90s Australian muscle car , Bruce as we call it. \"We take Bruce to the gym...we made it go faster. \"It was absolutely brilliant to make.\" Bruce turned out to be a 2005 Ford Falcon XR-8, which Mike and his co-star Marc 'Elvis' Priestley souped up to take part in a race with its historic rival - the Holden GTS. Former F1 mechanic Marc set about upgrading the fast Ford , including a new exhaust system to make it \"sound irresistible\" to potential buyers later on in the episode. And they did indeed manage to attract a customer and sell the car on for just over £15,000 (AUS $29,000). Considering they bought it for £12,500 and spent £14,500 restoring it, the team actually took quite a loss on this one. But Mike and Marc seemed more than satisfied with the project after hearing it around a scenic racetrack at Mount Panorama in New South Wales. And in his preview clip, Mike suggested that wouldn't be all they were doing as he mentioned that he got the chance to drive the Interceptor from the original Mad Max film. The Pursuit Special, which was actually a heavily modified Falcon, was driven by Mel Gibson in the 1979 action flick. However, Mike's wife was quick to warn him against giving too much away, saying: \"Too much information. \"Don't tell them too much. \"Tune in, tune in.\" You can watch Wheeler Dealers every week on Discovery Plus, with new episodes every Monday at 10pm. A basic subscription costs £3.99 a month of £39.99 a year. It comes after Mike showed of the \"most expensive car\" ever bought in the show's history.",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks have a 3-0 lead against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. Only a game away from sweeping the Wolves and advancing to the NBA Finals, the Mavericks will look to end this series in the upcoming Game 4. But will Dallas be forced to try to do it without Dereck Lively II? As per the official injury report of the league , the Dallas Mavericks have listed Dereck Lively II as “doubtful” for Game 4 against the Minnesota Timberwolves tonight, due to a sprain in his neck. The young big man has been averaging 8.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 1.1 blocks per game. He crashed the boards exceptionally well in Game 1 and took some of the scoring pressure upon himself in Game 2. In Game 3, Lively unfortunately played under 10 minutes before he picked up his injury. Worse, while he has not been flagged as ‘Out’ just yet, the pregame evaluation is not likely to clear Derek Lively II for the fourth game of this series. In all likelihood, the Dallas Mavericks will have to take the floor without Dereck Lively II tonight, with Dwight Powell expected to pick up a large portion of the rookie’s minutes. But, with the Minnesota Timberwolves hungry to grab their first victory of this series, will this be enough of an adjustment for the Mavs to grab this closeout game? Only time will tell.",

This material is crafted from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a versatile plastic type that is easily molded into various textures and colors. The manufacturing process typically involves coating a base layer of fabric, such as cotton or polyester, with a blend of PVC and plasticizers, which then undergoes heat treatment to create a durable and flexible finish. Its significance lies in its ability to offer an affordable and ethical alternative to real leather, making it an important material in various industries. The benefits of PVC leather cloth include its cost-effectiveness, ease of maintenance, and resistance to water, stains, and wear and tear, which make it a practical choice for consumers. Moreover, it offers designers and manufacturers a high degree of versatility due to its availability in a wide range of finishes and colors.

Additionally, the increasing adoption of synthetic leather in the production of affordable, stylish, and vegan accessories and garments further propels the market. Moreover, shifting trends towards sustainable and eco-friendly materials have led to innovations in PVC leather cloth production, including the development of eco-conscious varieties that minimize environmental impact, thereby creating a positive market outlook. Furthermore, continual advancements resulting in an enhanced quality and texture of PVC leather cloth is leading to a higher usage of the product in the production of leather alternatives, which is further impelling market growth. Apart from this, the market is significantly growing due to strategic collaborations with designers and brands that emphasize sustainability and innovation in their products. Concurrently, the rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms providing manufacturers with direct access to global consumers, while digital marketing strategies, including social media and influencer partnerships, are leading to enhanced brand visibility and consumer engagement, which is driving market growth.

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 Swissport is enhancing its sustainability efforts at Basel and Geneva airports with the delivery of new electric vehicles. Aligning with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the company aims to meet short-term CO2 reduction goals and transition to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Swissport Basel is set to increase its electric ground support equipment (eGSE) to 49% by the end of 2024, thanks to new electric ground power units (eGPUs) and ongoing fleet modernization. Swissport Geneva, already operating with 53% electric vehicles, plans to expand its electric vehicle portfolio to 58% by the end of 2024. “As a leading provider of airport ground services in Switzerland, Swissport is fully committed to reducing CO2 emissions. With the introduction of new electric vehicles, we are accelerating our transition to more sustainable operations. This investment not only strengthens our fleet, but also underscores our pivotal role in the ecological transformation of the airline industry,” says Bruno Stefani, CEO of Swissport Switzerland, Italy and France. Swissport aims for 55% electric vehicles in its global fleet by 2032, targeting a 42% CO2 reduction from its operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) compared to 2022 levels. The company prioritizes investing in electric ground support equipment (eGSE) and only purchases fossil-fueled models when no alternatives are available. eGSE has already become standard for many types of equipment. Over the next three years, Swissport plans to make 80% of all new motorized GSE acquisitions and replacements electric, investing over a billion euros in electric vehicles and equipment over the next decade. As a global leader in airport ground services and air cargo handling, Swissport operates at 286 airports in 44 countries. The company collaborates closely with aviation partners to promote sustainable aviation, including developing robust and efficient recharging infrastructure for vehicles like baggage tractors, aircraft tractors, transport vehicles, and passenger staircases. In 2023, Swissport provided top-tier airport ground services for approximately 232 million airline passengers (up from 186 million in 2022) and handled about 4.7 million tons of air freight (compared to 4.8 million in 2022) at 115 air cargo centers worldwide. Several warehouses have been certified for pharmaceutical logistics by IATA’s CEIV Pharma and the British MHRA. At the end of December 2023, Swissport, with around 60,000 employees, was active at 286 airports in 44 countries across six continents.",

        "content": "MUMBAI: Railway will soon launch sleeper coaches for Vande Bharat Express for long-distance journeys. The work is ongoing in the integral coach factory and it is rumored that the new train will mirror the same opulent interior of airlines. The train will come on par with the business class airline facility to provide peak travel comfort for passengers. Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has shared the pictures of the new train coaches. The line-up consists of luxury coaches that can travel at a speed of 200 km. Sources inside railways confirm that the sleeper coaches of Vande Bharat will start service soon. Talks are also ongoing on whether to disband the iconic Jan Shatabdi Express and Rajdhani trains with the arrival of the new high-speed Vande Bharat services. There are also plans to extend the Vande Bharat services and connect them with the Vande metro project in Mumbai. Meanwhile, an unnamed railway official told Financial Express that the current Vande Bharat Express trains will replace the Shatabdi Express in a phased manner. Railway sources say that sleeper coaches of Vande Bharat are also likely to run as an alternative to the current Rajdhani Express. Rajdhani Express is one of the premium services of Indian Railways connecting the national capital Delhi with various state capitals. In an earlier interview granted to Financial Express, BG Mallya, General Manager of Chennai Integral Coach Factory, said that many of the schedules operated by the Vande Bharat Express are compatible with the Shatabdi Express. He also hinted at the possibility that Vande Bharat Express will replace the Janashatabdi services in the future. It is said that the Shatabdi Express will be considered for other routes in the future.",

Osim aktuelnih tema iz svijeta sporta, biće riječi o tenderu za otkup TV prava za naredno svjetsko prvenstvo u fudbalu, trendovima u produkciji velikih sportskih takmičenja, finansijskom uticaju sportskih aktivnosti na rad javnih servisa.",
        "content": "A.M./B.B. SKUP U BUDVI Radio Televizija Crna Gora je kao članica Evropske radio difuzne unije (EBU), organizovala EBU sportsku skupštinu koja će se održavati danas i sjutra u Budvi. Osim aktuelnih tema iz svijeta sporta, biće riječi o tenderu za otkup TV prava za naredno svjetsko prvenstvo u fudbalu, trendovima u produkciji velikih sportskih takmičenja, finansijskom uticaju sportskih aktivnosti na rad javnih servisa. Generalni direktor javnog servisa Boris Raonić u uvodnom izlaganju je istakao da je siguran da će ova konferencija biti uspješna. \"Srećan sam da vidim kako je efikasan ovaj sportski dio EBU i po uzoru na njega treba da se organizuju i ostali djelovi, posebno u dijelu tranzicije sa linearnih na nelinearne medije. Mi smo jedan od najmanjih javnih servisa u Evropi, ali neko ko ima mnogo stvari da podijeli sa ostalim servisima\", kazao je Raonić. Raonić je otvorio 34. Sportsku skupštinu, koja ovoga puta broji 100 delegata. On je istakao da je za RTCG ovakav skup bitan, jer je to jedno veliko priznanje, pošto je domaćin još jednog skupa u Budvi popodne, okupljanja regionalnih javnih servisa. \"Jedan je Skupština Evropske radiodifuzne unije, dakle, zajednica javnih servisa unutar evropskog kontinenta, koja je posvećena sportu. Drugi je kasnije popodne, okupljanje javnih servisa koji treba da uspostavljaju saradnju u regionu. U ovom novom vremenu digitalnih medija i uticaja digitalnih medija, trendovi su u tom pravcu vrlo jasni, a to je da sve više ljudi prelazi sa nelinarnih na linarne sadržaje. Bez umrežavanja javnih servisa bili bi ugroženi, pa je bliska saradnja bitna i evo danas ćemo razgovarati o sportu. Mi smo otkupili Olimpijadu za naredna dva olimpijska ciklusa, razgovaraćemo i o nekim drugim zajedničkim akcijama, poput Svjetskog prvenstva u fudbalu i nekih drugih, brojnih zajedničkih akcija. Bez zajedničkog nastupa na velikom i ozbiljnom tržištu na nivou svijeta, veoma ćemo se teško kao pojedinci izboriti, upravo zbog toga su ovi skupovi bitni i meni je drago da je ovo najveća skupština do sada organizirana ovog tipa\", kazao je Raonić. Dodao je da je danas u Crnoj Gori više od sto članova javnih servisa sa teritorije Evrope i ponovo naglasio da bez tijesne saradnje, javni servisi će biti pregraženi od drugih globalih igrača. Što se tiče značaja održavanje konferencije u Crnoj Gori, raonić naglašava da izazovi slijede po pitanju ispunjavanja mjerila Ibara, i da fraza koja se godinama vrti u Crnoj Gori, da u Evropsku uniju ulazi kompletno društvo, ne samo pregovačke strukture je tačna, i ovo je jedan mali doprinos javnog servisa. \"Zahvaljujući ovoj aktivnosti i sličnim aktivnostima, javni servis svojim gledaocima će ponuditi najkvalitetnije sadržaje. Danas govorimo o sportu, a naravno i svim ostalim sadržajima koji su od interesovanja za građane\", naglasio je Raonić. Urednik sportske redakcije Televizije Crne Gore Dragiša Dedić je istakao da je Evropska radio-difuzna unija, osnovana 1993. godine, i da skoro nakon 40 godina Crna Gora je prvi put domaćin, organizator ovakvog skupa što je velika i satisfakcija i čast. \"Stotinu gostiju iz gotovo svih javnih servisa iz regiona, iz Evrope, da vidimo, da uporedimo gdje smo mi u ovom trenutku u odnosu na njih. Ovo je, dakle, i skupština sportskih programa, kažem, javnih servisa iz regiona, iz Evrope, analiza događaja koji su bili, uglavnom velike sportskih događaja, posebno onih koji tek slijede, a to su Evropsko prvenstvo i Ljetnje olimpijske igre. Pričaćemo o produkcijskim, tehničkim, organizacijskim i novinarski, aspektima ovog programa. Mi nemamo toliko često pravo da organizujemo ta velika takmičenja, ali što se tiče naših reprezentativnih selekcija u svim sportovima i klupskih takmičenja, za nas je veoma važno da vidimo kako se to radi kod nas, da uporedimo kako to rade u regionu i u svijetu\", istakao je Dedić.",

MVP finala Istočne konferencije Džejlen Braun nije očekivao da će dobiti to priznanje po završetku meča u Indijanapolisu. \"Nisam očekivao nagradu, ništa u životu nisam osvojio i samo sam bio srećan što smo pobijedili. Naučili smo kako da se nosimo sa pritiskom iz iskustva proteklih sezona, izgubili smo u borbi za titulu, pa zatim i prošle sezone u finalu Konferencija i mislim da smo izvukli dobre pouke iz tih serija. Ove godine napravili smo male izmjene u mentalitetu i evo, već se vidi razlika.\" Govorio i o svojim liderskim sposobnostima. \"Neki vokalni igrači našeg tima su otišli. Najviše mislim na svog brata Markusa Smarta i želio sam da popunim tu rupu u našem timu.

Ljudi pričaju kako smo istali isti, a mi smo ozbiljno promijenili roster. Čak tri trenera u posljednjih pet sezona i sada, kada se sve sumira, mislim da smo mnogo iskusniji tim.\" Džejson Tejtun uzbuđen je zbog nove borbe za titulu. \"Drago mi je što smo ponovo došli u situaciju da se borimo za titulu. To je specijalan osjećaj, nekima od nas je već poznat od ranije. Izvukli smo pouke iz prošlih neuspjeha i sada vjerujem da smo na dobrom putu da uzmemo trofej. Ove godine napravili smo izmjene u našoj igri, prošli smo pravi rolerkoster u plej-ofu i mislim da se već vidi razlika. Zahvalni smo što smo ponovo ovde\", rekao je Tejtum. Pohvalio je i rivale. \"Znali smo da se Indijana neće tako lako predati.

Ovo je tenis, ne možete da dobijete svaki meč. Čestitam protivniku, zaslužio je da prođe. Imao sam solidnu sezonu na šljaci, nisam uspio da pobijedim i to je to\", rekao je Vukić. Vukić je tokom susreta sa Džangom morao da traži medicinski tajm-aut. \"U petak se to dogodilo, idem na magnetnu rezonancu, nadam se da nije previše strašno. Osjećam neku vrstu neprijatnosti. Aduktor je u pitanju, imam problem sa lateralnim kretnjama. Razmišljao sam o svim mogućnostima i šta može da se desi na meču. Pozitivno je što sam izdržao četiri seta. Mislio sam da možda neću biti u stanju da igram, nisam mogao da podignem nogu. Smatram da nije toliko strašno da će da utiče na nastup na Vimbldonu. Pričali smo prije meča, mislili smo da je rizik preveliki, nije meč pogoršao situaciju, tako da mislim da će to da bude okej za London i travu.\" Vukićev otac je iz Crne Gore, dok je majka iz Bosne i Hercegovine. Brat mu je rođen u Sarajevu, a on u Sidneju. \"Moji roditelji su iz Crne Gore. Rođen sam i odrastao sam u Sidneju. Porodica sa očeve strane je odande, rođak je došao u Pariz da me podrži, bilo je lijepo što je tu. Bio sam blizu.\" Vukić razumije naš jezik, ali ga slabije govori. \"Da, da znam. Pričam malo\", rekao je na srpskom. Crna Gora bi imala zaista jaku reprezentaciju da su momci poput njega odlučili da igraju za taj nacionalni tim. Dotakao se i Miloša Raonića koji je takođe poreklom iz Crne Gore. \"Tačno, možete da kažete to i za neke druge. To je na neki način bio san, bila bi dobra reprezentacija. Moj otac zna njegovog ujaka, nema mnogo ljudi u tom dijelu, išli su zajedno u školu ili tako nešto, tako da tako znam Miloša.\" Vukić pamti Rolan Garos i po trijumfu kad Karlosom Alkarasom u kvalifikacijama 2020. godine, kada je Španac bio još golobradi mladić. \"Bio je oko 200. mjesta na rang listi, mlad, sa 16-17 godina. Igrali smo u prvom kolu kvalifikacija. Moglo je tad da se vidi da ima tu sirovu snagu, atleticizam, Ferero je bio tada tu. Bilo je mnogo oči koje su gledale, ne mene, već njega. Šalu na stranu, malo sam se opustio u nastavku meča i dobio. Igrao sam i protiv Sinera nekoliko puta. Postoji razlika između njih dvojice, nema mnogo igrača protiv kojih igraš i osjetiš tu veliku razliku u nivou. Obično je blizu i odluči nekoliko poena, ali takvi momci. Osjetiš da je drugačije\", zaključio je Vukić. Vukićev najbolji plasman na listi bilo je 48. mjesto prošle sezone, nije osvojio do sada nijednu titulu, a u karijeri je zaradio malo više od 1,7 miliona dolara.",

Njih dvojica se dugo poznaju a samo jednom su se ukrstili međusobno i to prije čak 11 godina. Bilo je to takođe u Parizu, ali sa druge strane grada, u dvorani \"Bersi\" kada je Đoković slavio u dva seta. \"Malo me je sramota da kažem šta su moja očekivanja. Sve osim titule za mene nije zadovoljavajuće, tako je oduvijek bilo. Zvučaće arogantno, ali imam karijeru koja tome govori u prilog.

Nisam igrao konstantno dobro duže vrijeme. Potrebno mi je to, da bih imao šansu da dođem do finala“, rekao je Đoković.

Morgan, a 63-year-old Joliet man, was reported missing. was reported missing by the Joliet Police Department on May 12 and was last seen in the Streator area on Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Investigator Josh McGrath said the investigation remains open and active. Morgan’s vehicle was found in the Otter Creek Township area about 6 p.m. May 25, 2023. He was last seen driving a tan 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer. The vehicle was observed in a photograph in at 5:12 a.m. on May 10, 2023. Amos’ SUV was located along North 18th Road east of East 22nd Road and was reported to have been first seen at that location on May 11, 2023, police said. Police said in November, the vehicle appeared to be in a similar condition as described by his family. It was an older vehicle with various mechanical issues. The vehicle was processed by Illinois State Police Crime Scene Services. Police have not disclosed the items collected or found inside Morgan’s vehicle. McGrath said police have continued to conduct searches, reaching out to the Decatur Police Department during the course of the investigation to conduct recent searches with assistance also from Joliet Police Department, Illinois State Police Crime Scene Investigation Division and Volunteer Cadaver Dog handlers from St. Clair Special Emergency Services Association. “The searches were focused on locations Mr. Morgan had reportedly worked during the time he went missing,” he said. “The searches were not successful in providing any additional information that would aid this investigation at this time.” In November McGrath said four searches had been conducted. These searches included the uses of search and rescue dogs (bloodhound dog, general tracking dogs and cadaver dogs). Authorities performed ground searches coordinated by the La Salle County Emergency Management Agency and aerial searches from the La Salle County Sheriff’s Office, Grundy County Sheriff’s Office and Peru Fire and EMS. “The search locations were focused in the surrounding areas of where Amos’ vehicle had been located,” he said in November, adding searches had been conducted at residences and surrounding properties of Amos’ family members. Police said there are no further updates to provide at this time, but foul play has not been ruled out. If anyone has information on the whereabouts of Morgan, contact the La Salle County Sheriff’s Office at 815-433-2161 or the Joliet Police Department at 815-724-3100. The Joliet Police Department remains the lead agency in this investigation. The LaSalle County Sheriff’s Office continues to assist the Joliet Police Department with their missing person investigation regarding Amos Morgan.",

        "content": "Nigeria’s First Lady, Remi Tinubu , on Monday, May 27, hosted more than five hundred (500) schoolchildren at the State House to mark this year’s Children’s Day celebration. Naija News reports that this is Remi Tinubu’s first Children’s Day celebration as first lady since her husband, Bola Tinubu , assumed office as Nigeria’s President. In her remark at the event tagged “Celebrating with our Children” and themed “Our Children, Our Future,” the former lawmaker described children as sources of immense joy who need parents and guardians to give them more love, care, and compassion. “I am delighted to welcome all our lovely children to the State House. It is your day and I am happy to celebrate with you all,’’ she said. In a statement released by her media aide, Busola Kukoyi, the first lady emphasized the importance of nurturing curiosity, continuous learning, and fearlessly asking questions. She also encouraged the children to dream big and strive for greatness, regardless of the obstacles they may encounter. She urged them to cultivate their curiosity and never stop learning. According to her, acquiring a proper education and attending school is crucial for their future. Mrs Tinubu also urged the children not to hesitate to ask questions and seek guidance. She expressed that, regardless of the difficulties they may face, they should always hold onto their dreams and aim for greatness. During the event, which showcased cultural presentations from participating schools, Senator Tinubu announced the upcoming launch of the Young Farmers Club in public primary and secondary schools nationwide. This initiative will be spearheaded by the Renewed Hope Initiative, RHI. “In addition to our various educational interventions, the ‘Young Farmers’ Club’ will soon be launched in Public Schools across the nation -The Club will be launched in State-owned Primary and Secondary Schools. “The motto of this club is ‘Growing the Food I Eat, Starts with Me.’ This initiative is to encourage farming among our young population. The first school to start the club, either primary or secondary will have their members kitted with branded club T-shirts and trousers. “The school with the best farm in each State would be identified, and prizes would be given to them, ranging from School renovations, equipping of School Laboratories, Provision of ICT equipment, and upgrading of School Libraries, as their preference may be. I encourage you all to participate in this and begin to nurture your gardens in your schools and at home,” she said. Senator Tinubu provided reassurance to the children that President Bola Tinubu is dedicated to constructing a country where every Nigerian child can achieve their utmost capabilities. She conveyed her positive outlook on the bright future that awaits the children of Nigeria. During her opening statement, the wife of the vice president, Nana Shettima, expressed her admiration for the First Lady’s initiative in hosting more than 500 school children at the State House to honour and uplift them. She highlighted that this gesture serves as evidence of the First Lady’s unwavering commitment to celebrating and supporting all sectors of society. “Our First Lady has always attached importance to the development of our children and this is evident in the various programs launched under the Renewed Hope Initiative (RHI), which focuses on improving the health, education, and well-being of women and children. “Through her Renewed Hope Initiative pet project, she has implemented various social investment programmes which are significant for children because when mothers are healthier and empowered, they can adequately pay for their children’s needs including their education, ” Shettima said. Naija News understands that a grant of ₦10 million each was given to participating schools from the Renewed Hope Initiative (RHI) to support the developmental needs of their schools. The event was attended by various dignitaries including wife of the Senate President, Mrs Ekaette Akpabio, the wife of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hajia Fatima Abass, and the wives of service chiefs, amongst others.",

        "description": "Replacing fossil fuel combustion with electric heat poses a significant challenge due to the lack of effective options for producing high-temperature heat from electricity.The post Electrically Conductive Bricks: A New Path to Replacing Fossil Fuels? appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "According to The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a startup in Medford, Massachusetts, might be on the verge of a groundbreaking development in clean energy technology, citing Inside Climate News where the news article first appeared. Electrified Thermal Solutions (ETS), an MIT spinoff, is testing an innovation that could significantly advance the clean energy transition. At a warehouse laboratory, ETS operates what its founders call the Joule Hive—a thermal battery the size of an elevator. This device is a large, insulated metal box filled with ceramic bricks that convert electricity into heat at temperatures up to 1,800 degrees Celsius, far beyond the melting point of steel, and can retain heat for several days. As the cost of renewable energy plummets, a major challenge remains: converting electricity to high-temperature heat to avoid burning coal or natural gas in heavy industries. Another challenge is storing energy—specifically heat—when solar and wind power are unavailable. Daniel Stack, CEO of ETS, in the article, emphasised the mission to decarbonise industry with electrified heat, stating, “If you are running an industrial plant where you’re making cement or steel or glass or ceramics or chemicals or even food or beverage products, you burn a lot of fossil fuels.” The industrial sector is responsible for nearly a quarter of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and across the globe contributing significantly to climate change. Thermal batteries powered by renewable energy could potentially reduce these emissions by half, as reported by the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions and the Renewable Thermal Collaborative. Replacing fossil fuel combustion with electric heat poses a significant challenge due to the lack of effective options for producing high-temperature heat from electricity. While common electric heaters work well at low temperatures, they fail at higher ones. The authors say that materials like molybdenum and silicon carbide can withstand higher temperatures but are too expensive. As an MIT grad student, Stack explored the possibility of using firebricks, commonly used in fireplaces and kilns, as a durable and cost-effective solution. By modifying the composition of the metal oxides in these bricks, Stack and co-founder Joey Kabel created bricks that conduct electricity and generate heat. “There’s no exotic metals in here, there’s nothing that’ll burn out,” Stack said, in the article. MIT nuclear engineering research scientist Charles Forsberg, Stack’s former thesis advisor and a company advisor, expressed confidence in the technology’s commercial potential. He highlighted a concern that many clean energy technologies invented in the US often find commercial success abroad. Recent government funding has provided ETS with significant support. In January, ETS received a $5 million grant from the US Energy Department to build its first commercial-scale demonstration project at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. This project aims to show how the thermal battery can provide high-temperature heat for industrial processes like cement manufacturing, which currently relies heavily on coal. The article quoting Massimo Toso, CEO of Buzzi Unicem USA, an industrial partner with ETS on the grant, praised the thermal battery as the first industrial heat decarbonization solution that could potentially eliminate fossil fuels cost-effectively. Curt Jawdy, a senior manager with the Tennessee Valley Authority, noted that ETS’s ability to charge the thermal battery during off-peak hours allows for industrial decarbonization without straining the electric grid. The project would replace natural gas-fired boilers at the Calvert City plant with ETS’s thermal batteries, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from steam generation by nearly 70%. In 2022, Ashland reported releasing 72,000 tons of carbon dioxide from natural gas combustion at the plant, equivalent to the emissions of 17,000 automobiles. ETS continues to scale up its capabilities, recently receiving its first multi-ton order of bricks from an industrial manufacturer. “Now, if you want two tons, [or, if] you want 2,000 tons, the manufacturer is ready to do that for us,” Stack said. If successful, this will be a perfect alternative to replacing fossil fuel.",

Халфът на Аталанта се контузи във финала за Купата на Италия срещу Ювентус преди две седмици и няма да успее да се възстанови за старта на Евро 2024, се казва в изявление на Нидерландската футболна федерация. Заради контузията де Роон пропусна финала в Лига Европа срещу Байер Леверкузен в Дъблин, който Аталанта спечели с 3:0. \"Не съм си представял такава седмица с толкова възходи и падения в живота си - загубих Купата на Италия, не можах да играя финала в Лига Европа“, каза Де Роон в социалните мрежи. \"Оказа се, че не мога да играя и на Евро 2024, но ще го преодолея, ще гледам отбора и приятелите си като фен, но моментът е много труден за мен\", добави той. Де Роон има 42 мача за Нидерландия, участвайки в последното Европейско и Световното първенство в Катар. Селекционерът на Нидерландия Роналд Куман ще обяви окончателния състав за Евро 2024 в сряда. След оттеглянето на Де Роон предварителният списък се състои от 29 играчи, като трима ще бъдат извадени от окончателния състав. Отборът се събра в понеделник за първата си тренировка, като Куинтен Тимбер тренира отделно от останалите, тъй като полузащитникът на Фейенорд все още лекува контузия. В навечерието на турнира в Германия нидерландците ще играят контролни мачове срещу Канада и Исландия следващата седмица. БТА",

        "content": "विराटनगर– हरेक दिन आयातको मात्रा बढिरहेका बेला कोशी प्रदेशबाट जापानमा घिउ निर्यात सुरु भएको छ । सरकारले आयात प्रतिस्थापन गर्ने नीति ल्याए पनि त्यसको प्रभावकारी कार्यान्वयन हुन सकेको छैन । अप्ठ्यारो र झन्झटिलो नीतिकै कारण अझैसम्म पनि लगानीमैत्री वातावरण बन्न नसकेको भन्दै निजी क्षेत्रले गुनासो गर्ने गरेका छन् । तर पछिल्लो समय निर्यातमा केही सकारात्मक संकेत देखिन थालेको छ । नेपालको चिया, अम्लिसो, अदुवा, छुर्पीलगायतका उत्पादनको विदेशी बजारमा राम्रै माग रहेको छ । पछिल्लो समय कोशी प्रदेशको राजधानी विराटनगरको एक डेरी उद्योगले जापानमा घिउ निर्यात सुरु गरेको छ । प्रदेश सरकारले दूधजन्य वस्तुको निर्यातमा अनुदान दिने घोषणा गरेपछि उद्योगले जापानमा घिउ पठाउन थालेको हो । विराटनगर–१४ मा २०७६ साल फागुनमा स्थापना भएको सूर्योदय मिल्क एण्ड बेभरेज उद्योग प्रालिले कोशी प्रदेशका मुख्यमन्त्री हिक्मतकुमार कार्कीको उपस्थितिमा एक कार्यक्रम गरी जापानतर्फ घिउ पठाएको हो । ‘अहिले प्रतिमहिना ५ हजार किलो घिउको माग आएको छ,’ उद्योगका सञ्चालक मनोज यादवले भने, ‘अहिले तीन हजार किलो चिउरा, तीन हजार किलो चियापत्ती, १२ सय किलो घिउ र १२ सय किलो मह पठाएका छौं ।’ अर्को महिनादेखि प्रतिमहिना ५–५ हजार किलो घिउ गरेर वार्षिक ५० मेट्रिक टन पठाउने सम्झौता गरेको उनले जानकारी दिए । गत वर्ष कोशीमा दूधको अत्याधिक उत्पादन हुँदा उद्योगमा धूलो दूध पनि सोही मात्रामा उत्पादन भएको थियो । उद्योगमा अहिले पनि ७० हजार किलो अर्थात् ७ करोड रुपैयाँ मूल्यभन्दा बढीको दूधजन्य वस्तु स्टकमा छ । पूर्वका विभिन्न ९ वटा डेरी उद्योगमा नौनी र धूलो दूधको स्टक बढ्दा किसानले भुक्तानी पाउन सकेका थिएनन् । सूर्योदयमा अहिले दैनिक ७० हजार किलो नौनी उत्पादन हुन्छ । उद्योग सञ्चालक यादवका अनुसार आन्तरिक डिमाण्ड बढेको खण्डमा पनि निर्यातले निरन्तरता पाउनेछ । विगतमा डीडीसीले जापानमा घिउ पठाउने गरेकोमा मागअनुसार पठाउन नसक्दा सम्झौता रद्द भएको थियो । ‘डीडीसीबाट पाठ सिकेर हामीले उहाँहरूको डिमाण्डलाई पूरा गर्ने हाम्रो प्रतिबद्धता गरेका छौं,’ यादवले भने, ‘हामीले सिजनमा उत्पादन भएको नौनीलाई स्टक गरेर भए पनि डिमाण्ड पूरा गर्न सक्छौं ।’ यादवका अनुसार जापानमा रहेको पद्मा कर्पोरेसनले नेपालको घिउ लिने सम्झौता गरेको हो । उसले जापानसहित ६–७ वटा देशमा सामान निर्यात गर्ने गर्दछ । ‘जापानमा हामीले नियमित घिउ पठाउन सक्यौं भने बंगलादेश, न्यूजिल्याण्डमा पनि सोही संस्थाले बजार खोजिदिने भएको छ’ यादवले भने । आफ्नो डेरी उद्योगमा दूध, दही, घिउ, बटर पनिर गरेर २० हजार लिटर दैनिक प्रशोधन गर्ने क्षमता रहेको यादवले बताए । त्यसमध्ये अहिले उद्योगले पाउडर प्लान्ट २४ घण्टै चलाएको छ । उनले भने, ‘बजारमा अहिले ५–६ हजार लिटर दूधको माग छ । तर, दूध कलेक्सन चाँहि १३–१४ हजार लिटरभन्दा धेरै रहेको छ ।’ प्रदेश सरकारले उद्योग खोल्दा दुई करोड अनुदान दिएको थियो । पछिल्लो पटक दूधजन्य पदार्थ निर्यात गर्न अनुदान दिने नीति सरकारले लिएको छ । जसअनुसार घिउमा प्रतिकिलो १२०, नौनीमा ९० रुपैयाँ, होलमिल्क पाउडरमा ८० रुपैयाँ र स्किम मिल्क पाउडरको लागि ७० रुपैयाँ अनुदान दिने सरकारको कार्यविधि बनेको छ । अनुदानका लागि प्रदेशको उद्योग, कृषि तथा सहकारी मन्त्रालयले चार करोड रुपैयाँ बजेट राखेको छ । ‘प्रदेश सरकारले निर्यातमा अनुदान दिनेगरी बजेट ल्याएपछि हामीले अन्तर्राष्ट्रिय बजारसम्म जान सक्ने भएका छौं,’ यादवले भने । पद्मा कर्पोरेसनले सुरुमा कम्पनीका ३२ वटै आउटलेटमा नेपालको घिउ लिइदिन्छु भनेको यादवले सुनाए । त्यसका लागि सुरुमा चार वटा प्रोडक्ट चिया, मह, चिउरा र घिउको माग गरेअनुसार आफूले खरिद गरेर तीन हजार किलो चिउरा, तीन हजार किलो चियापत्ती, १२ सय किलो घिउ र १२ सय किलो मह पठाउन लागेको उनको भनाइ छ । प्रदेश कृषि मन्त्रालयका सचिव डा.लेखराज दाहालले प्रदेश सरकारले विगतमा गरेको लगानीको प्रतिफल देखिन थालेको बताए । ‘जनताको डिमाण्ड दूध उत्पादन र विविधिकरणमा ठूलो लगानी गरेको छ । त्यही कारण इलाम, झापा, मोरङ सुनसरीमा उत्पादन बढेको छ’ उनले भने, ‘पहाडमा छुर्पी बनाएर विदेश निर्यात गर्ने गरिएको छ । त्यहाँबाट पनि घिउ निस्किने र तराईमा पाउडर बनाउँदा पनि घिउ निस्कन्छ । त्यसलाई बजारीकरण गर्न ठूलो चुनौती देखिएकोमा जापान घिउ पठाउने कुरा सुन्दा अत्यन्तै खुसी लागेको छ ।’ विदेश निर्यात हुन थाल्यो भने किसानले दूधको मूल्य अझै धेरै पाउने उनको भनाइ छ । नेपाल डेरी एशोसिएसनका अध्यक्ष प्रल्हाद दाहालले घिउ निर्यात गर्ने आफूहरूको सपना पूरा भएको भन्दै खुसी व्यक्त गरे । उनले नेपालमा दैनिक ६२ लाख लिटर दूध उत्पादन भएको जानकारी दिँदै त्यसमध्ये ३१ लाख लिटर दूध बजारमा आउने गरेकोमा १७ प्रतिशत मात्रै औपचारिक रुपमा बिक्री हुने र ३३ प्रतिशत अनौपचारिक रुपमा बिक्री भइरहेको बताए । दूधको बजारबाट दैनिक ६ करोड रुपैयाँ सहरबाट गाउँमा पैसा जाने उनको भनाइ छ । गाईभैंसी पालनमा ६ लाख कृषक परिवारले रोजगार पाएको छन् भने उद्योग क्षेत्रमा ४० हजारले रोजगार पाएका छन् । यस्तै निजी क्षेत्रका डेरी उद्योगमा ४५ अर्बभन्दा बढी लगानी भएको छ ।",

        "content": "But social care services for older people in the area were subject to a “significant” overspend as a result of interim arrangements while a new contract is progressed. It is believed that the area’s health and social care partnership (HSCP) has resources in place to cover its budget gap for the 2024/25 financial year. The details are given in a report which will go before the HSCP’s integration joint board at its meeting on Wednesday, May 29. James Gow, the HSCP’s head of finance and transformation, said: “This report provides a provisional summary of the year-end financial position which is subject to final accounting adjustments and external audit. “The position has improved, for health services, and the HSCP is reporting an overall underspend of £2.6m against its budget of £355m. Additional funding was confirmed in the last month of the year and some favourable movements against forecast were also identified which reduced spend, particularly relating to drugs costs. “Overall, this enabled the HSCP to maintain its reserves at a higher level than anticipated. Additionally, £4.7m of new non-recurring funding has been allocated to reserves to assist with future sustainability. “The improved performance provides funds for investment and enables the HSCP to take a longer term approach to addressing the financial challenges it faces going forward. “It believes it now has resources in place to cover its budget gap for 2024/25 and to progress infrastructure and transformation projects without having to identify and implement additional savings plans. “Financial risks remain high despite the favourable performance. A new spending review is expected from the Scottish Government in June 2024, this will help inform medium term financial planning.” Mr Gow added: “As has been reported all year, several social work budgets have been under severe pressure and older people services overspent significantly (by £2.4m or five per cent). “This was partly offset by the planned use of reserves, underspends on other services and vacancies. The overspend was as a result of increased care home placements and higher demand and costs for care at home services. “The overspending includes the additional costs relating to interim arrangements in the care at home service while the new contract is being progressed. This includes uplifts to improve terms and conditions for staff, to assist with the sustainability of the service and reduce unmet need. “The overspend was partly offset by savings in other areas including children’s services and learning disability budgets. The older people service also took on the direct staffing and management of care at home services in Kintyre towards the end of year, this added slightly to the overspend. “The social work budget was balanced through the increased use of general reserves which reduced by slightly more than anticipated as a result.”",

        "content": "Polokwane City interim coach Phuti Mohafe feels they overachieved by sneaking into the top eight by beating TS Galaxy on the final day of the season as their primary objective was to save the status of the team. Oswin Appollis’ solitary goal at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium sank Galaxy on Saturday, ensuring Rise and Shine finish eighth on the DStv Premiership standings in what was their first season back in the elite league after they were relegated in the 2019/20 season. By virtue of finishing eighth, Polokwane will face champions Mamelodi Sundowns in the MTN8 quarterfinals in the new season. “A chance of squeezing ourselves into the top eight has eluded us for the better part of the season but we managed that at the right time. The boys promised to go all out against Galaxy and they sure did deliver on their promise. The mandate wasn’t to be in the top eight but to save the [Premiership] status of the team,” Mohafe said. “So, for us to qualify for the MTN8 means we punched above our weight. We’ve overachieved based on the goals we had set for ourselves but all in all this is a great achievement for the club.” Mohafe was only installed as a coach on an interim basis when the club parted ways with Lehlohonolo Seema in November last year. The 50-year-old coach, who’d been serving as Seema’s deputy, went on to oversee 17 league games, winning five with six draws and five losses as well. It remains to be seen whether Polokwane will give Mohafe the post permanently. Last week he said he’d take whatever role the management decides for him. As much as his future is still unclear, Mohafe is already thinking about facing Sundowns in the MTN8 quarterfinals in the impending season. “We will be courageous against the champions but we know that it’ll be a mountain to climb to beat them. We need to believe that we can beat them if we are to stand a chance,” Mohafe said.",

        "content": "Wunder gibt es immer wieder Der VfL Bochum bleibt nach einem spektakulären Comeback in der Bundesliga. Quelle: IMAGO/Laci Perenyi Der VfL Bochum dreht in der Relegation gegen Fortuna Düsseldorf ein 0:3 und bleibt in der Bundesliga. Die spektakuläre Aufholjagd des Revierklubs liefert auch mit Blick auf die anstehenden Großereignisse eine wichtige Erkenntnis, meint Sportbuzzer-Redakteur Timon Zöfelt. Was für ein Wahnsinnsspektakel: Der VfL Bochum bleibt in der Bundesliga. Ein Fußball-Wunder ohne Ankündigung. Denn dass dem VfL nach dem niederschmetternden 0:3 im Relegationshinspiel tatsächlich noch die Wende gelingen würde, daran dürften im Vorlauf selbst kühnste Optimisten kaum mehr einen Gedanken verschwendet haben. Zu wenig Hoffnung versprachen die sportlich unterirdischen vergangenen Wochen, die teils blutleeren Auftritte und scheppernden Pleiten, die den Revierklub überhaupt erst in die Relegationsbredouille manövriert hatten. 0:5 (gegen Bayer Leverkusen) und 1:4 (gegen Werder Bremen) lauteten die ernüchternden Resultate zum Saisonabschluss. Es folgte die Unruhe um Stammkeeper Manuel Riemann, der für die Relegationspartien aus dem Kader flog und die deftige Niederlage gegen Düsseldorf vor heimischer Kulisse. Der siebte -Abstieg der Vereinsgeschichte schien besiegelt. Anschließende Durchhalteparolen und Kampfansagen wirkten nurmehr obligatorisch. Aufgeben in aller Öffentlichkeit - die Blöße wollte man sich an der Castroper Straße trotz der schier aussichtslosen Lage nicht geben. „Aggressivität, Intensität, Leidenschaft und Haltung - bis zum Schlusspfiff“ beschwor etwa Trainer Heiko Butscher in den vier Tagen zwischen Hin- und Rückspiel gebetsmühlenartig - so lange, bis nicht nur er, sondern auch seine Spieler offenbar wieder an ein furioses Comeback glaubten. Denn was der VfL in Düsseldorf ablieferte, hätten einer verunsicherten Mannschaft mit all dem Frust der Vorwochen im Hinterkopf nur die wenigsten zugetraut. Vollgasfußball, Wille und Leidenschaft - über 120 Minuten feinste Unterhaltung. Fanherz, was willst du mehr? Dass sich das Investment am Ende eines dramatischen Elfmeterschießens (6:5) auch noch auszahlte, markierte zumindest aus Bochumer Sicht das Happy End einer wilden Achterbahnfahrt der Gefühle - und der sportlichen Leistung. Am Ende darf sich nicht nur der VfL-Anhänger, sondern auch der gemeine Nicht-Düsseldorf-Fan in Bochum für einen atemberaubenden Flutlichtabend und einen würdigen Abschluss einer Saison bedanken, in der es mit Bayer Leverkusen als deutschem Meister oder dem 1. FC Heidenheim als Europapokal-Teilnehmer viele Überraschungen gab. Mehr zum Thema Zurück bleibt nun eine Erkenntnis, die aus deutscher Sicht mit Blick auf ein -Finale, in dem Borussia Dortmund gegen Rekordchampion Real Madrid als klarer Underdog daherkommt, sowie die danach anstehende Heim-Europameisterschaft nicht unerheblich ist. Eine Erkenntnis, die trotz scheinbar zunehmend schwindender Fußballromantik im von Geld getriebenen Geschäft auch zukünftig große Herzschlagmomente verspricht. Eine Erkenntnis, die nachhallt: Wunder gibt es im Fußball immer wieder.",

        "description": "Tamarind Water Benefits: In this article, we'll be sharing five reasons why tamarind water can be an effective ally to help you achieve your weight loss goals.",
        "content": "Have you been trying to shed those extra kilos lately? Are you on the lookout for recipes that can help you achieve your weight loss goals? Well, then tamarind water is what you need to try. Tamarind, also known as imli, has been a beloved favourite of many people since childhood. Loved for its tangy flavour, it's a common ingredient in several recipes and is also enjoyed in the form of candies. However, have you ever thought about having its water? This wonder elixir has several health benefits to offer and can also aid in weight loss. In this article, we'll be sharing five reasons why tamarind water can be an effective ally to help you achieve your weight loss goals. Also Read: Out Of Tamarind Paste? No Worries! Say Hello To These 5 Perfect Substitutes Photo Credit: iStock Tamarind water is low in calories. As per the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), a single tamarind has just about five to six calories. However, if you wish to add a sweetener or any spices to the water, this calorie count may vary. Digestive health is of paramount importance for weight loss. Studies suggest that the ingredients in tamarind have laxative properties, which can help keep your digestive system healthy. Smooth digestion ensures that stomach-related issues stay at bay, contributing to long-term weight loss goals. Tamarind water is also great for boosting your metabolism. When we have a good metabolism, we burn calories faster, aiding in weight loss. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the presence of flavonoids and polyphenols in tamarind helps achieve this. High-fibre foods are a must-have in a weight-loss diet. Tamarind is an excellent source of fibre and will help promote a feeling of fullness. Incorporating this water into your everyday diet may help control your appetite and aid in weight loss. Another reason why you should drink tamarind water is because it is rich in antioxidants. According to Delhi-based nutritionist Lokendra Tomar, \"Tamarind is packed with tartaric acid, which is a powerful antioxidant that inhibits the growth of free radicals in the body.\" A diet rich in antioxidants ensures your metabolic rate remains healthy, thus promoting weight loss.

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 22 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. A tornado watch was issued from North Carolina to Maryland. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that five people had died in his state. The fifth death was a 54-year-old man who had a heart attack while cutting fallen trees in Caldwell County in western Kentucky, the governor's office said. The death toll of 22 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky town of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). \"It's a big mess,\" said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. \"Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.\" Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. \"There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,\" Bailey said. \"Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 killed 81 people in Kentucky. \"It could have been much worse,\" Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. \"The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we've been through.\" More than 400,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 125,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages earlier in the day, according to PowerOutage.us. The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families of people who died. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index - a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body - neared triple digits in parts of south Texas on Monday. Extreme heat was also forecast for San Antonio and Dallas. In Florida, Melbourne and Ft. Pierce set new daily record highs Monday. Both hit 98 F (36.7 C). Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.",

        "content": "Israel pounded Rafah with airstrikes and tank fire on Tuesday, pressing its offensive in Gaza's southern city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, killing at least 45 people. At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of families displaced from assaults elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but have not yet entered the city in full force. Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago. They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said. On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighborhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” said Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, however, lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas armed group. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian National Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian National Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem through a corridor. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israel’s ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent “appalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)” in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee “stressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.” It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of “discussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.” It called for “confronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people” and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said. Arab countries and organizations slammed on Monday Israel for its strikes on a center for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens near the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement that the strikes \"claimed the lives of 35 martyrs and left dozens injured, most of them children and women\". The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza earlier said the attack hit a center run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a \"horrific massacre\". The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a \"heinous massacre\", accusing Israeli forces of \"deliberately targeting\" the tents of displaced people. The massacre is an act of \"defiance to all international resolutions,\" it added in a statement. Gaza's civil defense agency said Israeli strikes killed and wounded at least 50 people in the area, where it said 100,000 displaced people live. Hamas said Palestinians must \"rise up and march\" against the attack. The Israeli army said it had targeted Hamas fighters. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian armed group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\" Palestinians carry a body after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, 27 May 2024. (EPA) Qatar said on Monday the latest Israeli attack on Rafah could hinder mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a foreign ministry statement said. Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack, saying the Israeli forces’ actions against Palestinians \"exposes their blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world.\" \"This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including the International Justice Court resolution on immediately ceasing the aggression against Rafah, and protecting the Palestinian people,\" it demanded in a statement. Egypt strongly condemned the attack, saying Israeli forces \"deliberately\" targeted the displaced. The Foreign Ministry said Cairo had called on Israel \"to meet its legal commitments as an occupying power\" and respect the International Court of Justice’s call on it to immediately cease its military operations. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry condemned the \"ongoing heinous war crimes committed by the Israeli forces in Gaza,\" saying the latest attack in Rafah was a \"flagrant challenge to the ICJ and grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\" The Arab Parliament echoed the condemnation, warning in a statement that \"failure to hold Israel to account for its crimes and massacres against the Palestinians and failure to take any deterrent measures against it will only make it commit more killings and cause more destruction.\" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation slammed the \"heinous Israeli massacre against Palestinian civilians,\" describing it as a \"war crime, crime against humanity and state organized terrorism\" and demanding that Israel be held to account before international justice. The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting Tuesday over an Israeli strike that killed dozens in a displaced persons camp in Rafah, as three European countries were slated to formally recognize a Palestinian state. AFP journalists on the ground early Tuesday reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight in the southern Gaza border city, where an Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement center, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials. The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\". Israel said it was looking into the \"tragic accident\". \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres posted on social media. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths pointed to the widespread warnings of civilian deaths that circulated ahead of Israel's incursion into Rafah, saying in a statement: \"We've seen the consequences in last night's utterly unacceptable attack.\" \"To call it 'a mistake' is a message that means nothing for those killed, those grieving, and those trying to save lives,\" he added. Diplomats said the UN Security Council would convene Tuesday for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. The EU's foreign policy chief said he was \"horrified by news\" of the strike, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\", and a US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\". The Israeli military said it was launching a probe. - 'Don't know where to go' - Displaced Gazan Khalil al-Bahtini was preparing to leave the impacted area, telling AFP Monday that \"last night, the tent opposite to ours was targeted\". \"We have loaded all our belongings, but we don't know where to go.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament the deaths occurred \"despite our best efforts\" to protect civilians. The outcry over the strike came as Spain, Ireland and Norway were set to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas. \"Recognizing the state of Palestine is about justice for the Palestinian people,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Monday in Brussels. It was also \"the best guarantee of security for Israel and absolutely essential for reaching peace in the region\", he said alongside his Irish and Norwegian counterparts. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had told Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to West Bank Palestinians from June 1 as a \"preliminary punitive\" measure. - 'Charred bodies' - Israel launched the deadly strike on Rafah late Sunday, hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" in the city and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. Gaza's civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. \"We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly,\" said civil defense agency official Mohammad al-Mughayyir. One survivor, a woman who declined to be named, said: \"We heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming.\" Adding to already heightened tensions since Israel launched its Rafah ground operation, the Israeli and Egyptian militaries reported a \"shooting incident\" on Monday that killed one Egyptian guard in the border area between Egypt and the southern Gaza Strip. Both forces said they were investigating. - 'Dangerous violation' - Footage from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of paramedics racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded. Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impact of Israel's siege, which has led to severe shortages of fuel and \"water to extinguish fires\". The Israeli attack sparked strong protests from Egypt and Qatar, both of which have played key roles as mediators in efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange. Egypt deplored what it called the \"targeting of defenseless civilians\", saying it was part of \"a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable\". Qatar condemned a \"dangerous violation of international law\" and voiced \"concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts\" towards a truce. The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered Israel to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about \"the physical destruction\" of the Palestinians. The war in Gaza started after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on social media platform X that \"with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible\". \"The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,\" he said.",

        "description": "Know exactly what I need to do: Djokovic before French Open title defence",
        "content": "Listen to Story World number one Novak Djokovic will be the main attraction at Roland Garros on Tuesday when he begins his French Open title defence against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, but after last year's domination, this year brings less expectation. The French wildcard entry should provide the 24-time Grand Slam champion with little more than a decent workout before facing tougher opposition, but after losing to lucky loser Luca Nardi at Indian Wells, Djokovic won't take him lightly. Along with the French Open, the Serb won the Australian and U.S. Open last year, also reaching the Wimbledon final, and began 2023 with the Adelaide title, but this year Djokovic has failed to make a single final . His performances on clay this season have seen Djokovic exit Monte Carlo and Geneva at the semi-final stage, while in Rome he lost in the third round, but Paris is what he's been aiming for. \"I know exactly what I need to do in Grand Slam environment or Grand Slam competition, so to say,\" Djokovic told reporters. \"It's a whole different type of tournament and feel for the tournament than any other, really, tournaments that we have in the calendar.\" Oui meet again. #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/SlZFufBlqu — Novak Djokovic (@DjokerNole) May 26, 2024 His number one ranking is now under serious threat by Jannik Sinner, who ended Djokovic's title defence in Australia at the semi-final stage, and the 37-year-old will need a significant improvement in Paris to retain his place on the throne. Herbert knows what it takes to win at Roland Garros, but his two French Open titles have come playing doubles, where he has a career Grand Slam. As a singles player, he has yet to make it past the third round of the French Open. The pair has just one previous meeting, which came over a decade ago. At the Paris Masters in 2013, Herbert was Djokovic's first opponent, with the Serb winning in straight sets before going on to win the title. After Rafa Nadal's exit on Monday, fans will now look to \"The Djoker\" to provide the entertainment at Roland Garros.",

Dr. Najat Al Yafei, Manager of Oral Health Prevention and Promotion at PHCC, reported that this collaboration enhances partnership between the two entities, aiming to raise awareness regarding dental and gum health while performing Hajj rituals. The event involved the delivery of an awareness lecture on oral and dental health for diabetic patients, educating pilgrims on the significance of undergoing dental check-up before traveling for Hajj to avoid any potential oral and dental issues, in addition to providing preventive tips on how to manage dental emergencies. The dental medical team had also conducted oral check-ups for all diabetic patients attending the event and traveling for Hajj using the mobile dental unit. On another note, Dr. Adbulla Al Hamaq, QDS Executive Director, highlighted that Hajj entails alterations in physical activity, dietary patterns and meal timings, which necessitate precautions to prevent any adverse impact on blood sugar levels, stressing that for any travel, a thorough advance planning is required to meet all diabetic care needs.",

Secondoun'analisi del Pew Reasearch Center, il 38% delle pagine web cheesistevano nel 2013 non sono più accessibili e l'8% delle pagineesistenti nel 2023 non sono più disponibili. Nella maggior partedei casi perché sono state cancellate o rimosse. L'effetto \"decadimento digitale\", così lo chiama il centrostudi americano, significa che grandi quantità di notizie eimportanti contenuti di riferimento stanno scomparendo. E ilfenomeno si verifica in spazi online diversi, dai collegamentiche compaiono sui siti governativi a quelli di notizie, daWikipedia ai social media. Infatti, circa il 23% delle pagine dinotizie include almeno un collegamento non funzionante, il 21%dei siti web governativi e il 54% delle pagine di Wikipediainclude nei propri riferimenti un collegamento che non esistepiù. Più o meno lo stesso effetto si sta verificando sui socialnetwork. Un quinto dei tweet scompare dalla piattaforma entropochi mesi dalla pubblicazione. Lo studio è stato condotto raccogliendo campioni casuali diquasi un milione di pagine web, prese da Common Crawl, unservizio che archivia parti di Internet. I ricercatori hanno poicercato di vedere se quelle pagine continuassero ad esistere trail 2013 e il 2023. (ANSA).",

This was enough to make Nigel Farage fume as he frantically waved his arm in front of the camera while repeatedly crying out \"no\", seemingly ready to stop the exchange. \"I'm sorry, no, no, no, no. I'm hot having this! I'm not having this\", he firmly added before attempting to set the record straight: \"I'm not saying Muslims in the UK do not share British values, that would be a moronic thing to say. \"I'm talking about a minority but a growing minority of predominantly very young people in the British Muslim community\", Nigel Farage continued. While the conversation was able to continue without any more mishaps, viewers at home were incandescent with rage and swarmed over to X to share their frustrations, many of them even deemed the interview \"a car crash.\" \"God, this interview's an utter car crash\", one wrote. Another echoed with a plea: \"Get Farage off our screens. He is a parasite.\" A third agreed with another brutal statement: \" GMB interview with Farage = absolute car crash.\" A fourth chimed in: \"He's talking about bigotry towards certain people, while being openly bigoted without consequence. As he does day in day out. Keeps his job, keeps his money, keeps his platform.\" Another lamented: \"we really don't need to see Nigel Farage on our TV screens anymore.\" One agreed: \"WTF is Nigel Farage given air time? He lied about leaving the EU and also stirs up racial hatred.\" One ITV viewer raged: \"Nigel Farage has done the impossible. He's got me believe Richard Madeley is actually good at interviewing and made Nigel Farage look stupid in this interview!\" Elsewhere, one quipped: \"Looks like Poundland Trump Nigel Farage had a tough time defending his Islamophobic views on.\" Another surprisingly struck out at Charlotte Hawkins: \"Appallingly aggressive interview style from Charlotte on Good Morning Britain\", they wrote. While another demanded: \"If you are going to have Farage on, could you broadcast an immediate fact check afterwards.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

Paulo Dybala è una suggestione in casa Napoli, un nome che stuzzica la fantasia e che sarebbe assai gradito anche ad Antonio Conte\".

Le trattative riprenderanno a breve e c’è comunque la giusta fiducia che si possa arrivare ad un’intesa, anche se il tempo stringe e la clausola dell’argentino scade il 31 luglio. Dunque gli inglesi, come altri club in Spagna, potrebbero provare ad accelerare\". \"Intanto il Napoli studia le mosse. Il primo tassello sarà l’allenatore ed è già scattato il countdown per l’accordo definitivo con Antonio Conte (questione di dettagli, poi sarà fumata bianca e accordo triennale per un nuovo entusiasmante progetto).

        "content": "Il Napoli vuole ripartire con un progetto ambizioso in vista della prossima stagione, bisogna tornare nei piani alti della classifica. Come riferisce l'edizione odierna de Il Mattino, tenendo conto della cessione di Victor Osimhen, il Napoli ha promesso ad Antonio Conte di poter mettere a disposizione del mercato un budget da 200 milioni di euro una cifra che sarà il preludio della volontà di Conte di riportare il Napoli tra le big d'Italia. Vedremo se tali premesse saranno rispettate o meno. La volontà di Aurelio De Laurentiis è quella di rifondare il Napoli sia nella parte tecnica che in quella dirigenziale, l'arrivo di Giovanni Manna è solo il primo tassello. Il nuovo direttore Sportivo potrebbe essere affiancato da ulteriori figure manageriali. Il presidente ha ben compreso che quanto fatto nella scorsa annata non dovrà essere più ripetuto, anche lui ha ben compreso di aver fatto tantissimi errori dopo la vittoria del terzo storico Scudetto.",

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail A five-metre great white shark left keen fishers petrified and in awe when it circled their boat off the coast of New South Wales. Jamie Culver took the boat out with some friends off Port Stephens over the weekend when a grey figure emerged from the ocean and approached the vessel. It was his first time coming face-to-face with a great white, whose size he likened to a \"submarine\". ﻿ READ MORE: ﻿ Blood-sniffing dog joins search for mum after Sydney river birth The great white shark approached fishers off Port Stephens in New South Wales. (Jamie Culver ) \"It's weird to be in the presence of an apex predator,\" he said. \"To be petrified and scared but super excited is a rare feeling. A thrilling experience.\" ﻿ Culver said the \"incredibly placid\" great white stuck around their boat for about an hour and joined his group hunting for fish. ﻿ They even fed one of their catches to the shark. \"We had an agreement going on,\" he said. ﻿ READ MORE: ﻿ Gunmen 'made tea' as they kidnapped at least 160 in raid The great white shark stayed with the group for about an hour. (Jamie Culver ) ﻿Culver said he hopes to run into the shark again on his next fishing expedition but noted his disappointment the habitat is being threatened by an impending offshore wind farm. \"It's so upsetting we're going to lose this ecosystem,\" he said. ﻿ Great white sharks are considered a vulnerable species in several states, including New South Wales, according to Shark Smart. The estimated adult population is 750. ﻿The sharks are most commonly spotted in southern parts of the country.",

        "content": "Intervenuto ai microfoni del canale Twitch di Cronache di Spogliatoio , Riccardo Trevisani non ha avuto dubbi nell'indicare l'MVP del campionato italiano: \" Calhanoglu è continuo nella corsa, non sbaglia mai un calcio di rigore, è continuo sempre. Un leader silenzioso dell’Inter, sono un amante della continuità che è la parola chiave di Kroos. Con Inzaghi il turco ha raggiunto una continuità mai conosciuta, ma non all’Inter. In carriera, non era mai stato così in Germania o al Milan. Prima non era così intenso. Il miglior allenatore? Inzaghi, che ha migliorato chiunque. Acerbi, Dimarco e Bastoni che attaccano a destra quando vogliono. L’Inter gioca in un modo unico, ha modificato completamente il gioco rendendo tutti i giocatori mobili\". Poi il telecronista di Sportmediaset si è tolto qualche sassolino dalle scarpe: \"Sulla valutazione di Lautaro Martinez va preso in considerazione che lui ha fatto il porta-borracce ai Mondiali. Devi valutare quello, la Champions League dove ha fatto 12 gol in 44 partite. In ogni stagione ha un buco da due mesi in cui non segna, in nazionale arriva Julian Alvarez e non gioca\". \"Queste cose fanno 12-14 all’anno? No, se dev’essere pagato come LeBron James si lasci andare. Se arriva un’offerta da 100 milioni di euro io il giocatore lo cedo sempre. Non ce n’è uno che non vendi a quella cifra. Ci rifaccio tutta la squadra con competenza\" ha concluso Trevisani.",

        "content": "The Punjabi artist also looks back at her 2021 song ‘Lahu Di Awaaz’ and says she’s happy it ‘started a dialogue’ Punjabi artist Simiran Kaur Dhadli. Photo: Courtesy of Sony Music India For Punjabi powerhouse singer Simiran Kaur Dhadli, her latest song “Dupatta Drill” is an “emotion.” She tells , “[It’s] a story of a rooted, yet fearless boss woman who takes pride in her culture but isn’t afraid to deal with life’s challenges head-on.” The latest Haryanvi song from the Punjabi artist comes via Sony Music India and is coupled with a music video that showcases a female protagonist in rural Punjab showing local detractors who the boss is when they show up at her home to threaten her husband. With lyrics and composing work done by artist Rawme Hooda, the video also shows Dhadli in different avatars, from a villager adorned in black to a urban hustler in a pink power suit. “I’m sure that our song will make every woman proud,” Dhadli says. Although not exactly a drill beat – which Dhadli has taken on before – the artist says she’s not about selecting the sonic elements based on genres or sub-genres. She says, “I just catch vibes. So if it feels like it would work, it works.” Dhadli’s new song “Dupatta Drill” is her first solo release of the year, although she also collaborated with Punjabi artist on “Sherni” off the which came out earlier in 2024. “I had to be a part of that album because I will always be the first one to empower other artists if I get the opportunity to. Rashmeet and I became friends while working on the track ‘Sherni,’ which added more comfort to our collaboration,” Dhadli recalls. Previously, Dhadli has released hit songs like “Barood Wargi” (2021) and her own album in 2023. Often bringing an acerbic and hard-hitting vocal style to her songs, the Punjabi artist drew ire online for her 2021 song “Lahu Di Awaaz,” which was called out for putting down other women. Dhadli looks back at the release as her “personal favorite song,” because it “caught the attention of audiences and started a dialog.” She adds, “The lyrics were being discussed – praised and criticized – in India and across the world. The moment brought a lot of exposure and enlightenment to my life, and career.” Rather than focus on the negative criticism that came from “Lahu Di Awaaz,” Dhadli says she chooses to “soak in all the appreciation and love” she received for the song. “If I feel strongly about something, I would proudly make a song like that again,” she says. Dhadli went on to lend her vocals to the -composed song “Rok Leyy” for Bollywood movie in 2022. She’s certainly open to singing more film songs, but Dhadli says she takes a call based on he concept and emotion that it represents within a film. “For a purely Desi woman like me, in the end, it’s all about my roots, values and feelings,” she says. To that end, songs like “Faraar” from Punjabi film and “Rebel” from have been Dhadli’s way of reaching more audiences. She adds, “I provided theatrical rights of my vocals to the [2023] film . I sung two songs in that film alongside .” .",

        "description": "Baharav-Miara tells far-right police minister that move to summon Shabtai is unlawful and raises fears he is trying to intimidate the police forceThe post AG says Ben Gvir acting out of ‘ulterior motives’ in push to dismiss police chief appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir’s summons of Israel Police Chief Kobi Shabtai for a hearing ahead of Shabtai’s expected dismissal was unlawful and must be canceled, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara told the minister in a letter on Tuesday, adding that he had failed to provide adequate grounds for firing him. Ben Gvir announced on Monday that he was considering early termination for Shabtai, who is set to leave the position in a couple of months, claiming the reason was Shabtai’s alleged general dysfunction. However, Ben Gvir’s recommendation came only a day after Shabtai himself reported to Baharav-Miara that the minister was unlawfully interfering with the police. Baharav-Miara said she believed the far-right minister was acting out of “ulterior motives.” “The proximity of the timing raises serious concerns that under the guise of supposedly principled claims against the commissioner you are actually seeking to ‘punish’ him for seeking to prevent you from improperly interfering in the work of the police, all while you are acting, apparently, contrary to the express decision of the High Court of Justice,” the attorney general told Ben Gvir, adding that she was also concerned that Ben Gvir was trying to “send a message to the whole chain of command to scare them.” Heavy clashes broke out between police and worshipers at Mount Meron on Saturday night after hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men tried to violate the wartime ban on gatherings at the site where they wished to hold their annual Lag B’Omer celebration. In his report to Bahara-Miara on Sunday, Shabtai accused Ben Gvir of violating a High Court of Justice ruling in January that forbade him from giving police orders on how to deal with protests. Baharav-Miara added in her letter that because of the strong implications that may arise from summoning Shabtai to such a hearing, Ben Gvir was required to provide sufficient evidential foundation for the move. In his recommendation on Sunday, Ben Gvir accused Shabtai of being “out of touch,” only promoting officers who are close to him, and failing to hold in-depth meetings on rampant crime in the Arab community, among other charges. However, according to Baharav-Miara, the letter did not “provide the necessary foundation which is a significant problem in itself and increases the concern that other considerations guided” Ben Gvir. She also noted that Ben Gvir’s recommendation to terminate Shabtai came despite the fact that the police chief’s term, “which you extended only a few months ago, is set to end in less than two months and while the State of Israel is at war.” In January, the attorney general told the High Court that the national security minister could set policy but not instruct police on specific enforcement after activist groups petitioned the court to prevent Ben Gvir from giving orders on how to police protests. The court ruled that the far-right minister had violated a decision by the court last year that said he was not permitted to issue such orders. Ben Gvir and Shabtai have had an up-and-down relationship. The minister threatened last year not to extend the police commissioner’s term by the customary year, triggering a spat with National Unity chair Benny Gantz that was ultimately negotiated by the Likud party. Shabtai had been due to end his tenure in January and had previously said he would not seek an extension but changed his decision after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught on Israel in which terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and took 252 hostages, and the subsequent war in Gaza.",

        "content": "A pensioner has been ordered to pay more than £2,500 after piling his garden full of scrap metal - including multiple cars. Ivor Salter, 77, stored end-of-life vehicles and parts, mixed metal and electronic equipment, alongside general commercial and domestic wastes. Environment Agency officers visited the site at Otterford Caravan Park in Culmhead, Somerset, in January 2023. They attempted to secure voluntary removal of the waste and Salter had said he wished to clear the site. However, this was not forthcoming, and the officers issued him notices - which gave him until the end of 2023. But, in January of this year, officers went back to the site and found waste still present, including a large amount of scrap metal and vehicles, gas bottles, batteries, wood, tyres, rubble and commercial and domestic waste, some of which was in skips. In addition, there was a smell of oil contamination in one area. Since then, the site has virtually been cleared of waste. Last week, Taunton Magistrates' Court heard the site did have in place a T9 Waste Exemption registered in the name of Ivor Salter. This allowed for the recovery of scrap metal only. It also had an S1 exemption allowing for waste storage in secure containers and an S2 exemption allowing the securing of waste in a secure place. The T9 exemption allowed for the treatment of specified types and quantities of scrap metal, excluding scrap vehicles - at a site with sealed drainage to prevent liquid runoff. Salter admitted two charges of failing to comply with notices requiring the removal of waste from his land. He was fined £600 for each offence and ordered to pay £1,000 costs and a victim surcharge of £480. Chris Lawson from the Environment Agency said following the case: \"Waste exemptions have strict limits and conditions that must be complied with to protect the environment. \"If we issue a notice to clear waste from a site and you fail to comply, you risk prosecution, a fine and a criminal record.\"",

        "content": "Loading... Loading... In a recent development, the creators of Solana -based SOL/USD CAT memecoin have been implicated in a hack of a crypto influencer’s account. The coin tumbled sharply in response to the controversy. What Happened : In a long thread, prominent on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT , accused the team behind the newly-launched memecoin of hacking the X account of Gigantic-Cassocked-Rebirth , popularly known as GCR, on May 26. The team allegedly manipulated its own coin launch on May 24 to gain control of over 63% of the CAT supply. They then reportedly sold over $5 million worth of the coin, with profits distributed among multiple wallets. See Also: Donald Trump: ‘I Will Ensure That The Future Of Crypto And Bitcoin Will Be Made In The USA’ Part of these funds were later used for trading on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. The hackers opened long positions on ORDI ORDI and Ether.fi ETHFI/USD , betting on a future price increase. Using GCR’s hacked account, they shilled ORDI, causing a brief surge in the token’s price and gaining nearly $34,000. However, a similar attempt with the ETHFI token was unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of $3,500. GCR, using another account, alerted their followers about the hack of the original account immediately. Meanwhile, hackers continued with their dirty work, shilling ETHFI next. This time, however, they endured losses The explosive allegations weighed in on the coin, as it bled 70% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Why It Matters : The CAT memecoin’s launch and subsequent price manipulation come in the wake of a surge in popularity for cat-themed coins. The hack and alleged price manipulation by the team raise concerns about the integrity of this market. The incident also follows a trend of high-profile hacks in the crypto space lately. Olympian and media personality Caitlyn Jenner’s promotion of her own cryptocurrency raised suspicions of a potential hack .

        "description": "Повече за пакета от придобивки и различните инициативи научете от Маргарита Стефанова и Стоян Зарков от отдел „Хора и култура“ в компаниятa",
        "content": "Пакетът от социални придобивки на Amadeus Sofia е доста разнообразен и богат, като се започне от обичайното допълнително здравно застраховане за медицински прегледи, болничен престой и лекарства, ваучери за храна и спортна карта за сметка на компанията и стигнем до не толкова популярните като покриване на 50% от стойността на пакетите за допълнително здравно осигуряване на членовете на семейството на служителя. В допълнение имаме на разположение и вътрешна онлайн платформа за резервации на хотели по цял свят на преференциални цени, която е разработена от един от нашите екипи в България. Една от най-любопитните придобивки е възможността за придобиване на акции на Amadeus IT Group, групата, към която принадлежи Amadeus Sofia. Служителите могат да правят регулярна месечна вноска, като имат свободата сами да определят сумата на вноската. В края на двугодишния период на програмата те получават допълнителни безплатни акции, като техният брой е пропорционален на броя на закупените акции. Това, което истински ни отличава обаче от останалите компании на пазара, е програмата ни Workation, която позволява на нашите служители да работят отвсякъде в продължение на 30 работни дни. Всички наши служители стартират с 25 дни платен годишен отпуск, които нарастват до 30 в следващите 3 години. Знаем, че няма универсален подход, затова предлагаме различни възможности за гъвкаво работно време. Наред с хибридния модел на работа служителите на Amadeus Sofia могат да стартират работния процес между 8 и 10 ч. сутринта в зависимост от личните си предпочитания. Съответно краят на работния ден варира от 17 до 19 часа. Част от политиката за гъвкаво работно време е и програмата Workation, за която споменахме. В Amadeus целенасочено се грижим за нашите служители. С гъвкаво начало и край на работния ден, хибриден модел на работа и голям брой дни отпуск, ние се стремим да помогнем на нашите служители да оползотворят максимално времето си както на работното място, така и извън него. В допълнение насърчаваме всякакви колективни спортни активности, които не просто подобряват физическата активност, но помагат за опознаване на колегите и сплотяване на екипа – участие в маратони и физически предизвикателства, както и във вътрешни спортни активности. Бонусната система в нашата компания е свързана с годишното представяне както на служителите, така и на компанията. Бонусите се изплащат веднъж годишно. В нашата компания вярваме, че всеки сам е отговорен за личностното и професионалното си развитие. В началото на всяка година събираме информация за предпочитанията на служителите, които се съпоставят с нуждите и плановете на компанията. В резултат изготвяме годишен план и съответно бюджет, отделен само и единствено за обучения. В допълнение предоставяме огромен набор от онлайн обучения (вътрешни и външни), включително достъп до популярни обучителни платформи, които да помогнат на служителите в постигане на техните цели. Ресурсите са достъпни за всички, но оставяме на личната мотивация на нашите служители да преценят дали и каква част от тях искат да вземат. Да, организираме разнообразни и чести инициативи, които обхващат широк спектър от интереси. Така има за всекиго по нещо, което дава възможност на колегите да се опознаят по-добре. Социалните инициативи не само са силно ценени от екипа на Amadeus Sofia, но те се инициират от екип доброволци на локално ниво. Инвестираме много време и средства в регулярни и еднократни инициативи като кръводаряване, засаждане на дръвчета и грижа за „Гората на Amadeus”, кариерно ориентиране на деца от средните училища и много други. Всички тези кампании се случват под шапката на глобалната ни инициатива Amadeus Volunteer Day, която обхваща повече от 90 локации в света. Като Това, което ни отличава от други компании, е възможността тези дейности да се случват в работно време, за да не се отнема от личното време на нашите служители. От стартирането на глобалната инициатива през 2019 г. сме оказали положително въздействие върху повече от 50 000 души и сме работили с над 300 социални организации. Това показва, че доброволчеството в нашата компания е не само еднократно, а основна ценност. Имаме и една процедура за извънредни случаи, която дава възможност на служителите да работят дистанционно до 90 работни дни в годината в друга държава, ако членове на семейството им се нуждаят от специални грижи или помощ поради непредвидени обстоятелства. С тази мярка отдаваме необходимата важност на личните обстоятелства, при които нашите служители се нуждаят от допълнителна гъвкавост. Това е още един пример за силната ни ангажираност към нашите служители и фокус върху тяхното благосъстояние.",

        "content": "EASTENDERS legend Jacqueline Jossa looked amazing as she modelled her swimwear in a selection of new snaps. The actress, 31, who has shown off her recent weight loss, p osed for pictures while wearing pieces from her latest collection with fast fashion brand In The Style . Mum-of-two Jac oozed confidence while taking a number of mirror selfies in the gorgeous swimwear . In one snap the soap star rocked a low cut black bikini top and matching high-waisted bottoms. While in another she was all smiles in a multi-coloured swimsuit with waist belt. Jacqueline later showed off her amazing curves in a similar red coloured swimming costume. The Lauren Branning star styled her brunette locks in loose waves for the shoot, and opted for a smokey eye look. She also showed off a multi-coloured pattern midaxi dress and white co-ord from her swim drop 2 collection, which will be available to buy this Wednesday. Jac shared the pictures on her Instagram and captioned the post: \"Ladies!!!!! \"You all lovedddd my last swim drop I did with @inthestyle so we thought it was only right to do round 2 and I know you’re all going to loveeeee this one! 😍 \"Usually when we do swim we do your fave colours black, red etc however, this time we have switched it up and included a gorgeous print with a pop of colour and I am obsessed 😍👙 \"We have the most gorgeous, flattering styles to not only make you look amazing but to also make you feel it too. \"From swimsuits, high waist bikinis, co-ords, crochet cover ups and so much more we’ve got your holiday wardrobe covered 🤍.\" Over the last few months Jacqueline has given herself a lifestyle overhaul. Last month she showed off her weight loss as she left the EastEnders set. The I'm A Celeb favourite previously told how she has started a new fitness routine involving various workouts . She explained: \"I need to know what I'm doing is correct and right for me before I share it with you guys, because I don't want to be messing with your lives.\" However she has been sharing snaps of herself in the gym. Back in March she looked incredible as she posed up a storm after a sweaty gym session. Days before she posed for another fresh-faced snap in a plunging black vest and matching leggings. She confessed that having someone to work out with has made things a lot easier for her. The actress wrote on Instagram: \"Having someone to gym with has really changed everything for me.\" Tagging her pal, she added: \"I really love and appreciate you, the giggles and the fun ay.\" Meanwhile fans were worried that Jac and husband Dan Osbourne had split . However she put the rumours to bed after telling him \"I love you\" while on holiday in Dubai last month. Jac, Dan, their daughters Mia and Ella, and Dan's son Teddy became \"trapped\" by torrential rain and flooding following the worst storm in Dubai in 75 years.

Odds are subject to change. We are now into the third season of the Europa Conference League and it is difficult to argue that one of UEFA’s most recent innovations has failed. There were plenty of eyebrows raised when European football ’s governing body announced the addition of another tournament in time for the 2021/22 campaign. Some felt it was purely a money-making endeavour from UEFA, while others felt the competition was simply unnecessary. Yet three years into the project and the Conference League has allowed numerous clubs from across the continent to create memories they would not have without it. Fans of Roma and West Ham United, the two winners so far, will never forget the night that their respective team triumphed. Other sides have not gone on to lift the trophy but have nevertheless had special moments in the Conference League, including in this season’s edition. One of Olympiacos or Fiorentina will add their name to the list of champions on Wednesday night, as the two clubs prepare to butt heads in Athens. Olympiacos spent the first half of the campaign in the Europa League, but a third-place finish in their group saw them drop down into this tournament. Since then, they have eliminated Ferencvaros, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Fenerbahce and Aston Villa to book their place in the showpiece event. Fiorentina won their Conference League group by taking 12 points from a possible 18. In the knockout phase they have triumphed over Maccabi Haifa, Viktoria Plzen and Club Brugge. The Italian outfit will now be looking to make amends for last year, when they lost the final to West Ham. Indeed, Jarrod Bowen’s last-gasp goal broke Fiorentina hearts this time 12 months ago, so they will not be short of motivation on Wednesday. But Greek side Olympiacos will be well up for this match too, not least because it is taking place in the capital of their country, just over eight miles from their own stadium in Piraeus. One of Olympiacos or Fiorentina will be crowned Europa Conference League champions in Greece this week. Olympiacos were not given much of a chance when they were drawn against Aston Villa in the semi-finals, yet they ended up easing past Unai Emery’s men 6-2 on aggregate. It is true that they do not play in one of Europe’s big-five leagues, which may be one of the reasons Olympiacos are the underdogs here. They have also struggled for consistency domestically, finishing third in the Super League after going through three different managers under the trigger-happy Evangelos Marinakis, who also controls Nottingham Forest. Get the best free bet offers all season Claim Free Bets But Olympiacos have saved their best form for the Europa Conference League. Their current boss is Jose Luis Mendilibar, who led Sevilla to Europa League glory a year ago. And they will also benefit from not having had to travel for Wednesday’s game at the AEK Arena, where they will almost certainly have more fans present than Fiorentina. At the appealing odds available, it is well worth taking up this bet. ⚽ Go for an Olympiacos win at 11/5 with Betfred ⚽ Bet £10 GET £50 in bonuses New customers only.

Last season’s Champions League and Europa League finals both featured under 2.5 goals. The Europa Conference League showpiece had three goals, but the last one was scored very late on by the aforementioned Bowen. When the stakes are so high, the fear of making a costly error tends to take precedence over the willingness to take a risk. That is not to say this will not be an enjoyable encounter. Neither Olympiacos nor Fiorentina typically plays reactive, negative football. Even so, goals could be few and far between. If the scores are still level, say, midway through the second half, there is a good chance the final will go to extra time. Having conceded the winner so late in last year’s final, Fiorentina will be particularly wary of giving their opponents too much space in the closing stages. All in all, we should not expect a high-scoring affair. ⚽ Choose under 2.5 goals at 8/13 with Betfred ⚽ Ayoub El Kaabi has had a fantastic season. The Morocco international has put the ball in the back of the net 32 times in all competitions, including on 10 occasions in the Europa Conference League. No player in the tournament has a better record. Given that Fiorentina’s two leading goal-getters in the Conference League have struck four times, we can say with some confidence that El Kaabi will finish as the event’s top scorer this season. But the 30-year-old, who only joined Olympiacos last year having never only played for one other European club beforehand, will not be content unless his team are victorious on Wednesday. El Kaabi will be full of confidence given his exploits over the last few months and we like his chances of ending the season on a personal high. ⚽ Back Ayoub El Kaabi to score any time at 2/1 with Betfred ⚽ Bet £10 GET £50 in bonuses New customers only.

        "content": "Kerry Katona has confessed to having a hard time accepting her daughter's plans. Heidi, 17, is ready to embark on her new journey as she hopes to attend a performing art school in Liverpool. While the mother-daughter duo are celebrating the new beginnings with a London getaway, Kerry has admitted to finding it difficult to cope with the news. \"Heidi and I are going to have a little date night in London this week as I’m doing some work there and I’m taking her along. We have such a laugh together – she’s my golden child,\" Kerry said in an OK! Magazine column. \"She’s moving to Liverpool to go to a performing arts school in the summer once she finishes her GCSEs and I’m really going to miss her. I can’t cope!\" Kerry maintained that she's not the only one who's finding this transition difficult, noting that Heidi, too, is 'a mummy's girl'. \"She hates to admit it, but Heidi is definitely a mummy’s girl, so she’ll miss me too.\" The mum of four shared that while she will still have two more children to come home to after seeing two of her daughters make plans to leave the family nest. \"Soon I’m only going to have Max and DJ at home, who will still be at each other’s throats\", she added. Just last week, Kerry announced that Lilly, her daughter with ex husband Brian McFadden, has decided to move to Ireland. \"Lilly is looking for a fresh start so has decided she’s going to move over to Ireland to live with her grandparents on her dad’s side,\" Kerry wrote in a column on May 20. \"I think it’s a good thing because she’s 21 so it’ll be nice for her to stand on her own two feet, she rules the roost at our house.\" A post shared by Lilly Mcfadden (@lils.mc) \"Heidi has been doing her GCSEs at the moment and I’m so proud of her. She’s going to drama school once she’s finished and honestly is so talented. It makes me emotional that DJ is going to be the only one left in school\", she concluded.",

        "content": "KARACHI: The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) spokesperson Tuesday announced that Pakistan's Multi Mission Communication Satellite PAKSAT MM1 will be launched on Thursday. The Suparco scientists and engineers were examining the PAKSAT MM1, said the spokesperson. The launch will take place from XiChang Satellite Launch Centre (XSLC), China, the national space agency said, adding that the project is part of the National Space Programme 2047. According to a statement by the Suparco, the PAKSAT MM1 was conceived as a joint venture between Suparco and Chinese aerospace industry, keeping in sight the growing needs of the country in the broad-spectrum of communication and connectivity. \"This satellite project is a hallmark of technological cooperation between Peoples’ Republic of China and Pakistan,\" the statement read. It added that the satellite, based on advanced communication technologies, will play a pivotal role in the socio-economic uplift of the country. \"It will prove to be a stepping stone in the transformation of the country into Digital Pakistan,\" Suparco said. The research commission stated that the launching ceremony will be shown live for media from its establishments in Karachi and Islamabad. It should be noted that, so far, Pakistan has sent at least six assets in space such as BADR-A, BADR-B, PAKSAT 1-R, PRSS-1, PakTes 1-A and iCube Qamar. Earlier this month, iCube-Qamar, Pakistan's first satellite mission to the moon, sent the first-ever images of the moon captured in the lunar orbit following its ascent in space. Making this a groundbreaking development, according to IST, Qamar became the first Pakistani satellite to enter the lunar orbit and completed its rotation in 12 hours. The scientists termed the development “a great success overall”.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 An engine fire during a surging takeoff on a United Airlines flight to Seattle at Chicago’s O’Hare disrupted travel plans, forcing an emergency evacuation of passengers. On Monday, May 27, a United Airlines aircraft preparing for takeoff at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport was forced to abort its departure after one of its engines ignited. Eyewitnesses captured footage showing plumes of smoke billowing from one of the aircraft’s wings. The mishap occurred on the taxiway as United Flight 2091 was gearing up for its journey to Seattle at around 2 pm. Following the engine blaze, both the Federal Aviation Administration and United Airlines confirmed the emergency evacuation of 148 passengers and five crew members. A passenger-recorded video that went viral on social media depicts the moment smoke started spewing from the wing while the aircraft maneuvered along the tarmac. In response to the incident, the FAA briefly halted all incoming flights to the facility, with normal operations resuming at 2:45 pm. United Airlines reported that there were no injuries and assured that the engine issue was swiftly managed by emergency teams. They also stated that all passengers exited the aircraft safely and in an orderly fashion. Additionally, the Memorial Day weekend, typically one of the peak travel periods, saw disruptions at other major airports. For instance, JFK International Airport in Queens, New York, experienced a temporary ground halt due to severe thunderstorms, posing risks to travelers on the same day.",

        "content": "Deepika Padukone put her 'sunshine' yellow gown on sale hours after wearing it at an event of her skincare brand 82°E. On May 27, the mother-to-be took to Instagram and shared that her fans could get their hands on the beautiful 'Fresh Off The Rack!' dress. Deepika captioned her post, \"Fresh Off The Rack! Who’s getting their hands on this one!? As always, proceeds support @tlllfoundation initiatives. Visit www.thelivelovelaughfoundation.org/find-help/helplines for a list of verified helpline resources.\" The dress worn by the Pathaan actress sold within a few minutes for INR 34,000, claimed her team. The globally renowned actress then confirmed on her Instagram story that the gown has been 'sold out.' It is pertinent to mention that Deepika flaunted her baby bump at her brand's event, seemingly clapping back at the trolls who have been body-shaming online. For the unversed, Deepika and Ranveer, announced the joyous news of expecting their first child on February 29. Taking to Instagram, the lovebirds shared that their baby will be arriving in September 2024.",

The woman was reported missing by her family who published a picture of her and had appealed to the public to remain vigilant. Search teams including the Rescue 118 helicopter combed the area for the missing woman yesterday.

        "content": "La nouvelle fonctionnalité de Windows 11, Recall, fait beaucoup parler d'elle. Enregistrement permanent de l'activité de l'utilisateur, traitement des données en local grâce à l'IA... mais est-elle réservée aux processeurs Snapdragon X ? Pas forcément. Il y a quelques jours, Microsoft a annoncé Recall pour Windows 11. Cette fonctionnalité enregistre en permanence ce que l’utilisateur fait sur l’ordinateur, traite ces instantanés, puis permet la recherche de cet historique. C’est une recherche méga puissante qui tourne avec de l’IA en local. Mais selon Microsoft, les ordinateurs portables doivent répondre à certaines exigences spécifiques pour profiter de ces fonctionnalités, notamment un NPU avec au moins 40 TOPS de puissance. Ce qui est le cas sur les PC Copilot+ . Ceci est requis pour le traitement des données dans l’appareil et actuellement, seuls les nouveaux processeurs de la série Snapdragon X répondent à cette exigence. Pas si exclusif que ça Cependant, un développeur a montré que Recall pourrait ne pas être aussi exclusif que Microsoft le laisse entendre. En effet, il a réussi à faire fonctionner la fonctionnalité sur un système doté d’un autre processeur ARM64 non pris en charge. Ici, Recall tournait sur un SoC Snapdragon 7c+ Gen3, avec seulement 3,4 Go de mémoire vive, et pas de NPU spécifiquement. Il a également souligné que Recall devrait également fonctionner sur les systèmes AMD et Intel. Mais, pour le moment, c’est purement théorique. Alors, qu’est-ce que cela signifie pour l’avenir de Recall et de Windows 11 ? Tout d’abord, cela remet en question les affirmations de Microsoft selon lesquelles Recall est une fonctionnalité exclusive aux processeurs Snapdragon X. Cela pourrait également signifier que Recall sera disponible pour un plus grand nombre d’utilisateurs, ce qui est une bonne nouvelle pour ceux qui ont été déçus par les exigences strictes de Microsoft. Il faudra aussi se pencher sur la question des performances optimales. Il est essentiel que l’application Recall puisse maintenir des performances correctes au fil du temps, à mesure que la base de données historique s’enrichit. Cependant, à l’heure actuelle, nous disposons de peu d’informations sur les ressources spécifiques dont Recall aura besoin pour fonctionner de manière efficace, à part la puissance du NPU et les 16 Go de mémoire vive des CoPilot Plus. De leur côté, AMD et Intel travaillent sur une réplique à Qualcomm avec un NPU aussi puissant. On aura donc des réponses relativement rapidement sur la compatibilité de Recall au-delà des processeurs Snapdragon. Pour rappel, Windows Recall sera disponible avec le déploiement de Windows 11 24H2 à l’automne prochain.",

        "content": "The road beyond the white security gate, fringed by the rich green foliage of June, curved gently out of sight. “The code?” Conor couldn’t remember anything from John Price about a gate code. “That’s not an intercom?” The cabdriver shook his head. “You need a code to get in,” he said. Conor tried calling John, but the connection immediately failed—just a lonely bar of finicky service. The driver’s phone wasn’t picking up a signal, either. “Maybe you can walk,” the man suggested as his flimsy mask slipped down his nose, as it had many times throughout the ride. Conor was glad his mother was safely cocooned in their apartment back in Yonkers, where nearly everyone was still covering up in public spaces. The map on his phone wasn’t loading, so he didn’t know where exactly to find John’s house on this two-mile pinkie of land jutting from the southern shores of Massachusetts. He had to transport an overstuffed backpack, a rolling suitcase with one wonky wheel, his three-racquet tennis bag, and, most cumbersome of all, his twenty-five-pound tabletop stringing machine in another bag. Each leg of the journey he’d taken on foot since that morning—from his mother’s apartment to her Mitsubishi, the car to the Metro-North train, out of Grand Central to hail a taxi to Port Authority, boarding the bus to Providence, Rhode Island, exiting the station to this cab—had required him to shuffle along like a caterpillar. But it was either walk or wait, with the meter running, for another car to open the gate. Conor paid, collected his bags from the trunk, and passed through an opening for pedestrians. A wooden sign nailed to a tree greeted him in cursive: cutters neck association Single-lane Cutters Neck Road, bisecting and snaking down the peninsula, was quiet except for birdsong and the metallic chirr of insects. Roadside honeysuckle sweetened the tangy ocean air. To his left, a sailboat drowsed in the calm bay. The Atlantic was visible on the other side of the stiletto-shaped neck, too. Conor had seen aerial photography of the place from real estate sites, but he hadn’t been quite prepared for the essentially unspoiled beauty of what he was now walking through—for what, incredibly, he was about to live in (on?) for the summer. He snapped a picture of the ocean to send to his mother once he had service. He passed the first driveway, a gravel arc before a house studded with porthole windows, its slate-gray shingles blackened in spots like overripe bananas. The porch reassuringly featured a black lives matter sign; he’d had no idea what to expect politically from a gated community in deep-blue New England. The next few houses shared the same architectural style, though there were no more adornments except for one porch flying a massive American flag that twitched in the breeze. Conor set down the stringing machine and rubbed his sore arm. He regretted bringing it; he might not even have any use for it over the summer. A sporting goods store in town was still restringing racquets, but he couldn’t tolerate paying for anything he could do himself. The first sign of human life in this idyllic landscape came from a golf cart whizzing by, captained by a preteen blond girl, with two younger and even more towheaded children next to her. Conor smiled and waved in neighborly fashion, hoping they might offer him a lift on the back, but the trio only stared at him as they passed, deadpan as child actors in a horror movie. He finally reached the mailbox for John’s address, whose number he’d fortunately remembered. Midway up the grassy driveway through a stand of trees was a short perpendicular path into more woods. There, tucked away in a clearing within sight of John’s house, hid a squat cabin, Conor’s free living quarters until Labor Day. Or not quite free, but paid in kind. Having no luck on the job market and panicked about repaying his $144,000 in law school loans once the pandemic-triggered federal freeze was lifted, Conor had reached out in May to the Upper East Side tennis club where he’d worked summers in college. The lockdown had forced the place to close, but his old boss passed along an opportunity that had just come in: a member would put someone up in his waterfront guesthouse over the summer in exchange for lessons six days a week, and the instructor could turn a profit by charging other willing residents in the area. And now he was here. The door was ajar; when he’d asked about getting the keys, John had told him no one locked their doors on the neck, unnerving the native New Yorker used to the nightly ritual of deadbolts and chains. Inside the one-room cabin were a twin bed and a desk, a kitchenette, and a small bathroom with a shower. John had stocked the fridge and cupboards and provided a bicycle with a basket for the twenty-minute ride to the village market. Few frills, but also few distractions: an ideal headquarters for hunkering down for eight-hour days of studying for the bar exam in between tennis lessons. Conor’s phone was picking up service now, though still just one bar, and its seven-year-old battery was nearly dead. He sent the ocean picture to his mother and texted John that he’d arrived. A few minutes later there was a knock at the door. When he opened it, a lean man in his sixties was standing a dozen feet back. He wore a dark jacket and tie paired with salmon-colored shorts and sockless loafers. “Welcome to Cutters,” John said. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Price.” Though they were at a safe distance, Conor fished his mask out of his pocket and strapped it on as a show of respect. “It’s John, please. And no need for the mask if we’re outside.” “Of course,” Conor said. “My mom has diabetes, so I wear a mask everywhere.” His eyes drifted down again to John’s lower body. He’d never seen a man in pink shorts before. John evidently noticed. “I’ve been in Zoom meetings all day, hence the Bermuda businessman look. I suppose the pandemic is the new casual Fridays.” “I’ve been on a bus from Port Authority all day. Hence . . .” Conor gestured at his wrinkled attire. “That Providence station isn’t much better,” John said with a chuckle. “Someone here once parked his car around there, broad daylight—stolen in fifteen minutes. Did I not recommend you take Amtrak?” He had, but the cheapest train ticket was one hundred and nineteen dollars versus thirty-four for the bus. “I’ve always been a bus guy,” Conor said. John ran through the cabin’s quirks and said he’d walk over with him to the tennis court in the morning. “Oh,” he said after taking two steps. “There’s a party on the neck tonight. Outdoors, obviously. Please consider yourself my guest for any social events here.” “Thank you very much,” Conor said. “I’m pretty beat, so I’ll probably stay in.” “You sure? I know standing around with a bunch of stiff Wasps may not be the most exciting night, but you might meet some new clients. Assuming you don’t mind mixing business and pleasure.” Conor had only three tennis lessons lined up in addition to John’s unpaid sessions. Even if all of them turned into weekly appointments, he’d need to make much more money this summer. “As long as the Wasps don’t sting,” he said. After a harrowing couple of seconds in which Conor worried he’d offended him with his bad joke, John smiled. “If we do, we’re numb to it ourselves,” he said. “God’s frozen people.” __________________________________",

C’est la date fixée par le juge Luchmyparsad Aujayeb de la cour d’assises, le mercredi 22 mai, pour écouter le procès intenté aux frères Ritesh et Nitiraj Gurroby, ainsi qu’à Seewoodanand Rawoah, Geoffrey Kurson Imbé, Nogesh Gurroby, Jean Lucandro Prudence et Josué Joey Stephano Jean Baptiste. Cela, dans le sillage de la saisie de drogue record d’une valeur de Rs 3,3 milliards. En effet, le procès intenté aux accusés a été appelé mercredi dernier, mais en l’absence de trois accusés en cour, il a été ajourné. Lors de la prochaine séance, les accusés, qui ont retenu les services de Mes Gavin Glover, Senior Counsel , Shameer Hussenbocus et Alvin Juwaheer, devront signifier s’ils plaident coupable ou non coupable. En attendant, les avocats des accusés présents ont présenté une motion de remise en liberté devant la Cour suprême. Cela, après le refus de la Bail and Remand Court d’accorder la liberté sous caution aux accusés, leurs motions ayant été rejetées par la magistrate. L’affaire entourant cette requête sera appelée les 12 et 26 juillet. Possession d’héroïne et de haschich Ritesh Gurroby fait face à deux accusations formelles de trafic de drogue avec circonstances aggravantes – possession d’héroïne et possession de résine de cannabis pour la distribution. Son arrestation a eu lieu le 2 mai 2021 lorsque les enquêteurs de l’ Anti Drug and Smuggling Unit ont effectué une perquisition sur un terrain privé, situé à la route du Club Med à Pointe-aux-Canonniers. Cela, en présence du gardien Seewoodanand Rawoah. La découverte de trois endroits, dans un rayon de dix mètres, a été faite, avec des tas de branches et de feuilles ainsi que de la poudre de piment et des écailles de poisson éparpillées dessus. Les endroits semblaient avoir été altérés. En enlevant les branches et en creusant le sable à une profondeur de 50 cm, plusieurs sacs en plastique noirs qui renfermaient des sacs en raphia ont été retrouvés. Les agents ont saisi 219 colis d’héroïne ainsi que 26 colis de résine de cannabis, également appelée haschich, le poids total étant de 244 kg et la valeur dépassant Rs 3,3 milliards. Pour les enquêteurs, le vigile faisait référence aux accusés lorsqu’il a répondu, lors d’un exercice de confrontation aux pièces à conviction sur les lieux : «Ladrog dan sa sak ki lapolis finn tire la, mo patron Ritesh ek so gran frer Niresh ek de gro beta kosto ki kapav reponn lor la. Zot ti vinn sa plas-la merkredi ou zedi dan lazourne.» Il est ainsi reproché à Ritesh et Nitiraj Gurroby, de même qu’à Seewoodanand Rawoah, d’avoir été en possession de la drogue saisie. Geoffrey Kurson Imbé est, lui, accusé d’avoir acheminé la drogue, alors que Nogesh Gurroby et ses présumés acolytes, en l’occurrence Jean Lucandro Prudence et Josué Joey Stephano Jean Baptiste, auraient facilité le transport de la drogue.

Cette dernière a conclu que la charge provisoire déposée contre Shafeek Jhummun révèle une infraction reconnue par la loi, à savoir la torture d’animaux en vertu de l’article 3(1)(a) de la loi sur le bien-être animal et que les irrégularités présumées dans la saisie des animaux ne justifiaient pas la radiation des charges à ce stade. Le 9 janvier, Shafeek Jhummun a déposé la motion pour la radiation des charges. Son avocat, Me Imtihaz Mamoojee, a argué que l’enquête de la police n’a rien trouvé qui pourrait l’incriminer jusqu’ici et que ceci constitue un abus de procédures. L’homme de loi de Shafeek Jhummun a déposé les points pour motiver sa demande de radiation des charges provisoires, notamment que plusieurs mois se sont écoulés et que la police ne détient toujours aucune preuve contre son client. Il a souligné que son client a attendu presque un an et qu’aucune charge formelle n’a été logée contre lui dans cette affaire. Me Mamoojee a demandé l’annulation de l’information provisoire, arguant que la saisie des animaux était illégale selon l’article 47(3) de la Native Terrestrial Biodiversity and National Parks Act 2015, qui stipule que la confiscation ne peut se faire qu’à la discrétion du tribunal et après une condamnation. De plus, l’accusé a contesté le fait que la saisie ait été effectuée, sans préciser la disposition légale en vertu de laquelle elle a eu lieu et qu’il n’y a aucune urgence justifiant la saisie sans mandat. La poursuite a soutenu que la saisie des animaux est permise en vertu de l’article 5 de l’ Animal Welfare Act , qui autorise la saisie en cas de suspicion raisonnable d’infraction. La magistrate Veda Dawoonauth a noté que la principale contestation de la défense concerne la légalité de la saisie de singes. Toutefois, même en présence de prétendues irrégularités procédurales, a fait ressortir la magistrate, celles-ci ne suffisent pas à annuler l’information provisoire. Le tribunal a aussi fait ressortir que la loi sur la biodiversité terrestre et les parcs nationaux n’est pas pertinente dans ce cas, où l’infraction reprochée relève de l’ Animal Welfare Act . Rappelons que le 17 mars 2023, des officiers du National Parks and Conservation Service et du ministère de l’Agro-industrie avaient, lors d’une descente à JinFei, Riche-Terre, saisi 446 macaques. L’homme d’affaires a déposé une injonction contre le ministère pour qu’on ne se débarrasse pas de ses singes car, maintient-il dans son affidavit, il a déjà beaucoup investi dans ce projet et qu’il a tous les permis requis. Shafeek Jhummun fait aussi ressortir que le site de JinFei était temporairement utilisé dans l’attente de l’achèvement du nouveau site de Le Val, où il avait déjà les permis nécessaires pour lancer le projet. La demande devant la Cour suprême est toujours en suspens.

It's very important to be able to feel comfortable. I wish I had asked for help at a younger age.\" Selena launched her Rare Beauty brand in honour of Mental Health Awareness Week, and the firm has now created a new campaign that encourages people to \"call someone you miss, or someone who'd love to hear your voice\". In a promotional video, Selena explains: \"If you ever feel lonely, you're not alone. One in four people report they feel alone, and this year for Mental Health Awareness Month, Rare Beauty is encouraging everyone to make a good call - literally with a phone. \"Studies suggest that hearing a comforting voice can actually boost our mood in ways that texting can't, so pick up the phone and call someone you love. Call someone you haven't spoken to in a while. Or, call anyone who's sound of their voice would bring you comfort.\" Earlier this year, Selena claimed that she's on a \"mission\" with her Rare Beauty brand. The actress founded the cosmetics company back in 2020, and she feels proud of her brand for helping to raise mental health awareness. Selena said at the TIME100 Summit: \"I didn't want to really enter the cosmetics world without a mission.\" Selena sees Rare Beauty as her \"pride and joy\". The actress also revealed that she's still committed to the venture, and she doesn't have any plans to walk away from Rare Beauty anytime soon. Selena explained: \"I don't think I'm going anywhere.

        "description": "Dublin's top diplomat also says sanctions may be placed on officials who aid violent West Bank settlers, in comments ahead of move to officially recognize Palestinian stateThe post Irish FM says EU mulling sanctions on Israel if it defies ICJ ruling on Rafah appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said Monday that he and his European Union counterparts had a “significant” discussion about the possibility of levying sanctions on Israel if it fails to comply with international humanitarian law. “For the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I’ve seen significant discussion on sanctions and ‘what if,’” Martin told reporters following a meeting of the EU’s Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. He qualified that there is “some distance between people articulating the need for a sanctions-based approach if Israel does not comply with the ICJ’s ruling ... to agreement in the Council meeting, given all of the different perspectives there.” The Irish foreign minister told reporters that the discussion focused on provisional orders issued by the International Court of Justice last week calling on Israel to halt military operations in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah that would risk the destruction of the civilian population sheltering there. Martin was quoted as saying that the EU foreign ministers agreed that Israel should “adhere to those provisional orders... and cease its military operations in Rafah.” While Martin and the EU ministers appear to interpret the ruling as a call for Israel to halt all military activity in Rafah, Israel says that is not the case, pointing to the arguments of four ICJ justices that the key operative clause in the ruling does not require that Israel immediately halt all operations there, but rather that it specifically halt military operations that “could bring about physical destruction in whole or in part” of the Palestinians. Martin did not give details on the types of sanctions discussed by the EU diplomats. Irish news outlet RTE quoted Martin as saying that a number of foreign ministers had also raised the possibility of sanctions against Israeli officials who were aiding and abetting violent West Bank settlers. So far, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and the European Union have sanctioned only the violent settlers themselves in recent months, amid a surge of incidents since October 7, and a 15-year high in 2023. The EU meeting followed Israeli airstrikes near Rafah on Sunday night that drew outraged reactions from Palestinians and around the world, with Hamas health authorities reporting that 45 people were killed and dozens injured in the attack and in an ensuing blaze in a camp housing displaced civilians. The Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted a Hamas compound and eliminated two commanders in the terror group’s ranks, and that it is investigating what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “tragic mishap.” Ireland has been among the most vocal critics of Israel over the war against Hamas. Along with Spain and Norway, it is due to formalize their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. The United States and some other European countries favor reviving negotiations on resolving the conflict before recognizing a Palestinian state. The move by Ireland, Spain, and Norway was denounced as a “reward for terrorism” by Israel, which is waging a war in the Gaza Strip sparked by Hamas’s shock October 7 assault, when thousands of terrorists stormed into southern Israel to kill nearly 1,200 people and take 252 hostages amid rampant atrocities. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 36,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though only some 24,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The toll, which cannot be verified, includes some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Two hundred and eighty-eight soldiers have been killed during the ground offensive against Hamas and amid operations along the Gaza border. A civilian Defense Ministry contractor has also been killed in the Strip.",

        "content": "Indian Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa got off to a flier and defeated Firouzja Alireza of France in the Armageddon game in the first round of Norway Chess tournament here on Tuesday. Published: May 28, 2024 1:47 PM IST By Indian Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa got off to a flier and defeated Firouzja Alireza of France in the Armageddon game in the first round of Norway Chess tournament here on Tuesday. After an easy draw under normal time control, Praggnanadhaa got 10 minutes as white compared to Alireza’s seven but with the condition that he had to win as a draw would have given black extra points. The Indian was clinical in his approach and carved out a fine victory in the endgame. The day saw all the games under classical time control ending in draws in both men and women’s section and as many as six Armageddon happened to decide the winner in this unique format. World number one Magnus Carlsen played out a 14-move draw in classical and then a 68-move marathon draw with reigning world champion Ding Liren to seal the day in his favour while Hikaru Nakamura proved stronger than American compatriot Fabiano Caruana in the Armageddon. After the end of the first round, Praggnanandhaa, Carlsen and Nakamura share the lead on 1.5 points apiece while Alireza, Liren and Caruana follow them a half point behind. Each win under classical time control here is worth three points while the winner takes 1.5 home in the Armageddon with one point for the one on the receiving end. Praggnanandhaa scored his first ever over-the-board victory over Alireza. It was an irregular queen pawn opening wherein Praggnanadhaa seized a small advantage and benefitted from a casual 26th move by Alireza. Pouncing on the opportunity, a series of forced moves gave the Indian a decisive advantage and the game was over in 38 moves. The women’s section, having the same prize fund as men’s (USD 161000), also witnessed three draws in Classical time control between six competitors. Needing a draw with black pieces in the Armageddon, Koneru Humpy did not face many difficulties and got the 1.5 points. R Vaishali came up with an inspired performance with black against women’s world champion Wenjun Ju of China but could not cash in on her chances. It was a tough Classical game for the elder sister of Praggnanandhaa as Wenjun took her for a long grind in a queen and opposite coloured Bishops endgame. The game was drawn after 80 moves thanks to Vaishali’s resistance. Wenjun sacrificed a pawn early in the return game in a must-win situation and Vaishali had this extra pawn for quite some time. However, with the clock ticking away, Vaishali could not withstand the pressure. Wenjun won in 43 moves. In the other game of the day, TIngjie Lei of China prevailed over Anna Muzychuk of Ukraine, winning the Armageddon with black. Results round 1 men: R Praggnanandhaa (Ind, 1.5) beat Firouzja Alireza (Fra) 1.5-1; Ding Liren (Chn, 1) lost to Magnus Carlsen (1.5) 1-1.5; Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 1) lost to Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 1.5) 1-1.5. Women: Pia Cramling (Swe, 1) lost to Koneru Humpy (Ind, 1.5) 1-1.5; Wenjun Ju (Chn, 1.5) beat R Vaishali (Ind, 1) 1.5-1; Anna Muzychuk (Ukr, 1) lost to Tingjie Lei (Chn, 1.5) 1-1.5.

        "content": "Top Tipster and Broadcaster, Ed 'Longshot Ted' Quigley smashed in a 12/1 winner at the weekend, and is back with a Lucky 15 for the Tuesday action. Find the following picks for Tuesday races. Play on the races with our best expert-rated horse racing betting sites : SECRET HANDSHEIKH is an enigmatic individual, but returning to Brighton off a mark of 63 can see the 6-year-old back in the thick of the action here. The gelding is no 1lb lower than when last successful, with that win coming over this course and distance, so there are plenty of reasons for optimism here. Secret Handsheikh has two wins and a placed effort from just the five starts over the trip and track, so this is clearly a venue that plays to his strengths. Christian Howarth is in the saddle claiming a valuable 3lbs, so all in all, this combination look well treated ahead of this assignment at the Sussex venue. 🏇 Back Secret Handsheikh at bet365 🏇 MAMMY made some noticeable late-headway to finish runner-up over 6f at Wolverhampton last time out, and a reproduction of that effort would see the daughter of Bated Breath have every chance of shedding her maiden tag in this Fillies' Handicap. The drop back to a strongly-run 6f seemed to suit her well, and she fairly came home with a wet-sail, finding only one rival too good. Igf she can translate her All-Weather form back to the turf, then this improving sort has every chance of defying a mark of 67. James Doyle takes the ride on the Michael Bell trained individual, and they look to have major claims. 🎇 Back Mammy at Copybet 🎇 ENDERMAN has been frustrating and consistent in equal measure, but looks to have everything in his favour for this encounter. He won on his only previous start over course and distance, and so this track can see Enderman go one place better than his previous two starts, and get back in the winner's enclosure here. A mark of 58 shouldn't be beyond him, and he has the valuable experience of Mr Simon Walker for this amateur event. Underfoot conditions are another positive - his best form has come on deep ground, so with plenty a rain around the Redcar area, the ground is expected to be riding very soft. All in all, he is ticking all the right boxes for this assignment. 🏇 Bet on Enderman at talkSPORT BET 🏇 TREGELE shaped with much more zest when fifth at Ffos Las a fortnight ago, when cutting out a lot of the running in that 2m4f Handicap Hurdle, then staying on the one-pace in the closing stages. That was an encouraging display, and the step up to 2m7f looks ideal for this lightly-raced 6-year-old. The extra distance, dovetailed with eased to a mark of 104 can see Kim Bailey's charge get right in the shake-up. Ciaran Gethings is in the saddle, and looking at the gelding's pedigree, it shouldn't be an inconvenience if any rain hits the track and softens up underfoot conditions. He looks a solid each-way play. 🏇 Back Tregele at BetUK 🏇 Don't forget Ed will be back on Friday as it is Classic time! The Epsom Oaks rolls into town, and Ed will be giving his big-race verdict for talkSPORT.

        "content": "Tsitsipas e Badosa o Sinner e Kalinskaya ? Da quando Jannik ha reso pubblica la sua storia con la tennista russa è partito il dibattito su quale sia la coppia più glamour del tennis. Ieri è stato il giorno in cui il tennista azzurro ha scoperto le carte. Lei è andata a vedere il suo esordio con Eubanks in tribuna, mischiata con i tifosi. Lui è apparso addirittura nel box della russa durante l’esordio con la francese Burel . Un grande gesto d’amore, anche perché in contemporanea si giocava la sfida Zverev-Nadal , e in tribuna c’erano Djokovic, Alcaraz, Swiatek e altre celebrità del tennis ad assistere all’ultima della leggenda maiorchina al Roland Garros. La presenza di Sinner in tribuna ha caricato Kalinskaya, che per la prima volta in carriera ha passato il primo turno al Roland Garros. Tsitsipas e Badosa insieme in campo nel doppio misto Tsitsipas e Badosa sono una coppia di vecchia data ormai, che ha già attraversato una crisi. Si sono lasciati, ma ora sono di nuovo insieme. C’è grande attesa oggi per vederli in campo insieme: loro hanno deciso di mettersi in gioco anche nel tennis, si divertono, e oggi sono impegnati nel primo turno del doppio misto contro il duo formato dalla giapponese Ena Shibahara e dallo statunitense Nathaniel Lammons . Proprio alla vigilia del Roland Garros Tsitsipas ha rivelato di essere tornato con Paula Badosa: “Qualche settimana fa - ha detto il greco - avevo deciso di prendermi una pausa ma mi sono reso conto che questo rapporto che ho con Paula è completamente diverso da qualsiasi altro rapporto che ho avuto in passato, sento che lei è la persona giusta. Quindi ci siamo rimessi insieme e stiamo bene”. I due erano stati avvistati insieme a Roma, in occasione degli Internazionali d’Italia e poi a Montecarlo per qualche giorno di relax. Sicuramente Sinner tiene molto di più a mantenere riservata la sua vita privata rispetto a Tsitsipas. Sarà difficile vedere foto di Jannik e Anna insieme.",

        "content": "As autoridades da Papua Nova Guiné começaram a retirar cerca de 7.900 pessoas do centro do país devido à possibilidade de um novo deslizamento de terras, anunciou hoje um dirigente regional. \"Estamos a tentar retirar\", declarou à agência France-Presse (AFP) o administrador da província de Enga, Sandis Tsaka. \"A toda a hora, ouvimos a rocha a partir-se. É como uma bomba ou um tiro e as pedras continuam a cair\", acrescentou. A retirada ocorre depois de um deslizamento de terras ter praticamente destruído na madrugada de sexta-feira uma localidade daquela província. O Governo de Papua Nova Guiné informou na segunda-feira que o deslizamento soterrou mais de duas mil pessoas e pediu formalmente ajuda internacional. O número das autoridades é cerca de três vezes superior à estimativa das Nações Unidas, que era 670. Apesar deste número, as equipas de socorro só encontraram até ao momento cinco corpos e a perna de uma sexta pessoa, informou hoje a AFP. As estimativas sobre o número de vítimas variaram muito desde a ocorrência do desastre e não ficou imediatamente claro como as autoridades chegaram ao número de pessoas afetadas. O ministro da Defesa da Papua Nova Guiné, Billy Joseph, e o diretor do Centro Nacional de Desastres do governo, Laso Mana, voaram no domingo num helicóptero militar australiano da capital Port Moresby para Yambali, 600 quilómetros a noroeste, para fazer um levantamento das necessidades. A Papua Nova Guiné é uma nação em desenvolvimento, composta sobretudo por agricultores de subsistência, com 800 idiomas. Existem poucas estradas fora das principais cidades.

        "description": "Intesa totale su ingaggio e durata: triennale da 7 milioni con bonus Champions e scudetto senza clausole. Ecco le garanzie richieste dal tecnico prima della firma",
        "content": "Dalla contestazione a Conte - e basta - sarà un attimo. Giusto il tempo di concludere e infiocchettare la trattativa che ha riacceso la passione sopita del popolo azzurro, deluso e rassegnato dopo una stagione terrificante, nel momento stesso in cui è venuta fuori la notizia. Antonio Conte è un interruttore che ha elettrizzato Napoli : è un nome, un allenatore, una garanzia. Ma Antonio Conte è anche un uomo che vuole garanzie prima di accettare definitivamente la proposta di Aurelio De Laurentiis e firmare: garanzie tecniche , sia chiaro. In questa storia estremamente affascinante per tutti, per il club che vuole affidare la rifondazione degli ex campioni d’Italia a un leader tecnico di spessore internazionale e per un allenatore entusiasta di ripartire da una squadra di talenti stritolati all’improvviso dalle incertezze, bisogna però incontrarsi a piazza della vittoria, sereni e convinti: i legali stanno leggendo le carte e l’accordo economico complessivo è quasi raggiunto (bisogna limare ancora qualche aspetto relativo allo staff); e lo stesso discorso vale per la durata del rapporto, un triennale senza clausole di uscite a favore del club ; ora, non resta che stringersi la mano sui piani di mercato. Conte vuole il Napoli e lo vuole ambizioso, lo ha spiegato al presidente e al ds Manna: acquisti di un certo spessore, calciatori funzionali all’esigenza di tornare subito grandi dopo il decimo posto e l’esclusione dalle coppe europee, e conferme eccellenti. Una su tutte: Kvaratskhelia , per altro incedibile. E mica soltanto quella. A maggior ragione se Osimhen, come annunciato a gennaio da De Laurentiis in persona, cambierà aria. I dettagli dell'accordo tra Conte e il Napoli Con ordine. La questione economica non rappresenta più l’ostacolo insormontabile che appariva un po’ di tempo fa: Conte e il Napoli hanno chiacchierato, si sono confrontati, hanno smussato gli angoli e alla fine si sono ritrovati a carezzare la stessa idea: lavorare insieme. Va da sé che ognuno ha ceduto o concesso qualcosa all’altro, fino all’intesa di massima: contratto triennale da 7 milioni di euro a stagione tra base fissa (più o meno 6) e bonus Champions; più bonus scudetto da un milione . Già: dalla depressione, al sogno. È così che funziona con chi ha vinto e vuole continuare a vincere. Conte ha voglia di tornare in panchina dopo più di un anno trascorso a rigenerarsi e a godere della famiglia in coda alla risoluzione con il Tottenham, e ha scelto di farlo a Napoli. Però alle sue condizioni: lui crede nel lavoro e nei sacrifici e soprattutto è estremamente ambizioso . Di deludere ancora una città passata troppo in fretta dalla sbornia al mal di testa, insomma, non ne ha alcuna voglia. Lo staff di Conte e la telefonata informale a qualche giocatore Tanto per chiudere il discorso economico: c'è da limare qualcosa negli accordi relativi al suo staff. Comunque già piuttosto attivo: pare che qualche membro della squadra di Conte si sia già messo in contatto in maniera informale con alcuni giocatori del Napoli. Per parlare di presente e soprattutto di futuro. A proposito: i nomi, mettendo insieme il patrimonio storico e le esperienze precedenti, sono quelli del vice Christian Stellini; di Gianluca Conte, suo fratello e match analyst; dei preparatori atletici Costantino Coratti e Stefano Bruno (che troverebbero Francesco Sinatti). E poi Lele Oriali, con lui all’ Inter e in Nazionale. Sulla scena, ora, sono comparsi anche i legali. Gli avvocati. I tecnici: i contratti del Napoli sono labirinti infiniti di clausole e cavilli, dalle sezioni base a quelle relative all’immagine, e il pool di professionisti di Conte li sta vivisezionando. Lui, nel frattempo, parla con il ds Manna e con De Laurentiis del futuro, dei giocatori, del mercato: vuole una squadra ambiziosa. E non c’è possibilità di deroga.",

In the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the insurance giant had posted a PAT of Rs 13,427 crore. For the full year (FY) 2024, LIC's PAT climbed 11% to Rs 40,676 crore from Rs 36,397 crore in FY2023. The state-owned insurer's board recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share for FY2024, in addition to an interim dividend of Rs 4 per share declared earlier. LIC saw its total premium income grow marginally to Rs 4,75,070 crore in FY2024 from Rs 4,74,005 crore in the previous fiscal. Its individual new premium rose 3.5% to Rs 3,03,768 crore. However, the group business premium declined 5.7% to Rs 1,71,302 crore. The insurer continued leading the life insurance market with an overall 38.44% individual segment share and 72.3% in group insurance based on first year premium collection as per regulatory data. LIC said the wage revision impact was reflected in the quarterly numbers. Its value of new business grew 5% to Rs 9,583 crore for FY2024, with the solvency ratio strengthening to 1.98 from 1.87 in the previous year.",

        "content": "MAGA troll Sam Alito, having signaled his solidarity with Donald Trump’s insurrectionists by flying (or allowing to have flown) an upside-down American flag at his home, is disgracing the U.S. Supreme Court with his mere presence. That sentence barely scratches the surface. I need to elaborate. As the southern writer Flannery O’Connor said long ago, “You tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” The story is that Alito, having openly trumpeted his bias in flagrant violation of every judicial code of ethics, deserves to be impeached. But since that certainly won’t happen – there aren’t enough votes in the Senate, and the chamber’s Democrats are predictably too chicken to highlight the issue – at minimum Alito should recuse himself from the long-awaited “immunity” ruling that could whitewash Trump’s criminal liability in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That won’t happen, either. The current high court is a sinkhole of mendacity, and its own ethics code has more holes than a slab of Swiss cheese. For instance: “a justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the Justice’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.” Alito can skirt that provision with ease. He can simply decide that none of his critics are “unbiased and reasonable.” Even though a federal recusal law says that “Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” Alito can simply decide for himself that his impartiality is being unreasonably questioned. So Alito is betting the story of his family’s stop-the-steal flag (and a second controversial flag flown at his Jersey Shore vacation home) will simply slide down the Orwellian memory hole, just like so many of MAGA’s fascist-adjacent perfidies. That wouldn’t happen if Senate Democrats raised hell and demanded Alito appear at a hearing to explain himself, but, as we know, Dems don’t do courage (“I don’t think there’s much to be gained with a hearing at this point,” said Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin). The result: Alito has free rein to make a mockery of the oath he took to “faithfully and impartially discharge” his duties under the Constitution. And we become further benumbed as this once-vibrant democracy sleepwalks toward dystopia. In just the latest example, a video on Trump’s social media account said if he’s elected, we will have the “creation of a unified Reich.” That video prompted this reaction from ex-Trump deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews, who said, “Trump’s continued use of Nazi rhetoric is un-American and despicable. Yet too many Americans are brushing off the glaring red flags about what could happen if he returns to the White House. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.” But we were talking here about Alito. He went full MAGA last month during the oral argument about Trump’s fake “immunity” case – he worried that a criminal prosecution of Trump might “lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy” – and now he’s poised to vote on the ultimate ruling. There is one foreseeable ray of hope. It’s possible that he and Clarence Thomas (the other most detestably compromised justice) will be outflanked. A narrow court majority could rule that Trump’s Jan. 6 insurrectionist conduct does not shield him from criminal prosecution and that the trial currently in limbo can indeed proceed. Such a ruling wouldn’t remove the stain of Alito’s treasonous flag-waving, but it would arguably salvage the court’s credibility – at least until the next scandal besmirches it. – Copyright 2024 Dick Polman, distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.

        "content": "MADRID: Spain, Ireland and Norway will formally recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas more than seven months into the devastating Gaza war. The three European countries believe their initiative has a strong symbolic impact, which is likely to encourage others to follow suit. They also point to Norway and Spain's historic role in advancing Israel-Palestinian peace efforts. In 1991, the two sides sat down together for the first time at the Madrid peace conference that paved the way for the 1993 Oslo Accords. \"Recognition of the State of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice... Is it also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said before meeting his cabinet. The move, he said, was \"not against anyone, least of all Israel\". \"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future -- that of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security.\" Sanchez also said the decision reflected Spain's \"outright rejection of Hamas, which is against the two-state solution\" and whose October 7 attacks led to the Gaza war. The plans were unveiled last week in a coordinated announcement by the prime ministers of the three countries. Formal recognition was to take place in all three on Tuesday. Both the Spanish and Irish cabinets were to meet to approve the step on Tuesday morning, while Norway informed Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at the weekend that its recognition would also take effect on Tuesday. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, threw his weight behind supporting the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian National Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian National Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem through a corridor. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” For decades, formal recognition of a Palestinian state has been seen as the endgame of a negotiated peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Although Slovenia has also started the process of recognising a Palestinian state, the issue has provoked sharp disagreement within the 27-nation European Union. Washington and most Western European nations have said they are willing to one day recognise Palestinian statehood, but not before agreement on thorny issues like the status of Jerusalem and final borders. The spiralling bloodshed in Gaza has revived calls for Palestinians to be given their own state, with a growing number of European countries expressing a desire to do so. Within the EU, states like France believe it is not the right time to do so, while Germany only envisages recognition following negotiations between the two sides. Tuesday's move by Spain, Ireland and Norway will mean 145 of the United Nations' 193 member states now recognise Palestinian statehood. These include many Middle Eastern, African and Asian countries but not the United States, Canada, most of western Europe, Australia, Japan or South Korea. In 2014, Sweden became the first EU member to recognise a Palestinian state. It followed in the footsteps of six other European countries that took the step before joining the bloc -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania. The decision by Madrid, Dublin and Oslo has provoked a furious response from Israel. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz began taking \"preliminary punitive measures\" against Spain, ordering its Jerusalem consulate to stop offering consular services to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. \"We will not put up with harming Israel's sovereignty and security,\" Katz said, describing recognition of Palestinian statehood as \"an award to Hamas.\" On October 7, Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel, killing more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza. The Israeli army says 37 of them are dead. Israel's relentless retaliatory offensive has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. On Sunday, Katz posted a video on X splicing footage of the October 7 attacks with flamenco dancing, saying: \"Sanchez: Hamas thanks you for your service\" in a move denounced by Spain as \"scandalous and revolting\". A day earlier, Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles accused Israel of committing \"a real genocide\" in Gaza. Until now, such language had only been heard from far-left ministers of Sanchez's coalition but not from a member of his Socialist party. \"Some have framed our decision to recognise the state of Palestine as... a reward for terror. Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said on Monday. With the move, Dublin, Madrid and Oslo want \"to see a future of normalised relations between the two peoples\" and to implement a two-state solution, he said.",

        "description": "A military police vehicle on Monday enters the compound of an army division in Inje, Gangwon, where a soldier passed out on Thursday during a disciplinary drill. The soldier was pronounced dead on Saturday. [YONHAP] Military investigators on Tuesday accused two military officers of being responsible for the death of a soldier who died two days after he collapsed during a disciplinary drill last Thursday. The military’s internal investigation team alleged that a captain and a first lieutenant abused their power and committed occupational negligence resulting in death, by ordering subordinate conscripts to undergo excessive activity. The Korean Army referred the case and records to the Gangwon Provincial Police Agency on Tuesday. The military will submit CCTV footage of Thursday’s drill to the police. Related ArticleTrainee soldier dies two days after fainting during military drillSoldier dies after grenade explosion during army training in Sejong The two military officials reportedly made six conscripts do push-ups and run approximately 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles) while carrying full packs of equipment at midday Thursday as punishment for causing noise in their dormitory Wednesday night. Ordering soldiers in full kit to do push-ups or run and walk over a kilometer as a punitive measure flouts Korean Army regulations. The victim collapsed on Thursday around 5:20 p.m. during the training drill in Inje, Gangwon, and was pronounced dead on Saturday after his condition worsened. The dead soldier reportedly showed “symptoms of rhabdomyolysis,” a muscle-damaging illness often induced by excessive physical exercise or high fever, an anonymous officer from the Korean Army said Tuesday. The source said additional analysis will be carried out to determine the precise cause of his death. According to a report from Yonhap News Agency on Tuesday, the state-run health agency registered the fallen soldier as a heatstroke patient when he was hospitalized. An anonymous official from the state-managed Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency told Yonhap that “this year’s first casualty of heat-related illness appears to be the soldier who recently passed out during military training.” A weather report from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) said the temperatures at 5 p.m. in Inje, Gangwon, hit 27.4 degrees Celsius (81.3 degrees Fahrenheit). According to the Center of Military Human Rights on Tuesday, the soldier had a body temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius when he first arrived at the hospital, and he was breathing two times faster than usual. The center denounced the two accused officers, calling the soldier's death a “manmade disaster caused by treating the soldier as if he was faking his illness.” According to a statement released by the center on Monday, the two officers dismissed a report from the victim’s fellow soldier that the individual in question appeared ill during the drill. “The investigation has found an irregularity in the process of ordering the disciplinary drill,” Seo Woo-suk, a spokesman of the Korean Army, said during a regular briefing on Tuesday. Seo added that the military will “proactively cooperate with the police investigation to ascertain the truth.” The military classified his death as a line-of-duty death and posthumously promoted him to lance corporal.

        "description": "As economies in Asia and the Pacific slow and grow older, countries need to do more to ensure that workers get the education, training and social safety nets needed to raise incomes and ensure social equity, a United Nations report said Tuesday.",
        "content": "TOKYO — As economies in Asia and the Pacific slow and grow older, countries need to do more to ensure that workers get the education, training and social safety nets needed to raise incomes and ensure social equity, a United Nations report said Tuesday. The report by the International Labor Organization said that growth in productivity has slowed, hurting incomes and undermining the purchasing power of the region's 2 billion workers. By improving productivity, governments can boost incomes and better prepare for the aging of their work forces, the report said. Two in three workers in the region were in informal employment in 2023, such as day labor, lacking the kinds of protections that come from formal jobs. ''The lack of job opportunities that meet decent work criteria, including good incomes, not only jeopardizes social justice in the region, but it also presents a risk factor for the labor market outlook,'' the report said. Showing the potential for improvement, labor productivity grew at an average annual rate of 4.3% in 2004-2021, helping to raise incomes per worker in terms of purchasing power parity, which compares standards of living in different countries using a common currency, to $15,700 from $7,700. But it has slowed in the past decade, the report said, hindering progress toward greater affluence. It highlighted various challenges, especially unemployment among young people not in school, which is more than triple the adult rate, at 13.7%. Increasing use of artificial intelligence and other automation technology will cause some people to lose their jobs, it said, with women engaged in clerical and information technology work most likely to be affected as companies roll back their reliance on offshore call centers that have provided good quality jobs in countries like the Philippines and India. Other factors such as trade disputes and political turmoil threaten to disrupt jobs in some industries, but aging poses an even bigger challenge as countries grow old before they become affluent. The ratio of people in Asia aged older than 65 to those 15–64 years old is projected to double to nearly a third by 2050 from about 15% in 2023, the ILO report says. In places like Japan, short-handed employers have moved to alleviate work loads by using robots and computerized ordering in restaurants, cutting hours and installing self-checkout machines. The report noted that a key reason why some countries face labor shortages despite having ample numbers of unemployed or underemployed workers is a mismatch between jobs and skills and education. ''The region still has huge potential for upskilling, productivity improvements and efficiency gains, which can alleviate demographic pressures on the labor market,\" it said. The report noted that more than a third of workers in the region have educational levels too low for their occupations, compared with 18% of workers in high-income countries. Among other findings: People in Asia and the Pacific still work more hours than workers in other regions, at 44 hours per week on average, though that is down from more than 47 hours in 2005. In 2023, nearly 73 million workers in the region lived in extreme poverty, with daily incomes of less than $2.15 in purchasing power parity per person. Despite raising retirement ages, total labor force participation in the Asia-Pacific region fell from 67% in 1991 to about 61% in 2023. It's projected to fall to 55% by 2050. The need for workers to provide long-term care in the region is forecast to more than double to 90 million by 2050 from 46 million in 2023. That would raise the proportion of people working in the field to 4.3% of the total from 2.3% now.",

        "content": "Here is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to bring you up to speed on what you need to know today... U of T seeks court injunction to clear encampment as protesters stay put The University of Toronto is asking the courts to authorize police action to remove protesters who refuse orders to leave a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on campus earlier this month. The university has filed a notice of motion in court aimed at bringing about an end to the demonstration while saying the encampment was causing irreparable harm to the institution. The protesters have said they are prepared to fight back with their own legal team and refused to leave the site, ignoring a Monday morning deadline set in a trespass notice issued last week. Ontario legislator to make history at Queen’s Park with speech, questions in Oji-Cree A First Nation legislator in Ontario is set to make history today when he rises at Queen’s Park to speak in his language, Oji-Cree. For the first time in its history, the Ontario legislature will allow, interpret and transcribe a language other than English and French. New Democrat Sol Mamakwa sparked the change after convincing Government House Leader Paul Calandra to allow him to speak in the language his parents taught him. The legislature has brought in interpreters who will translate Mamakwa’s words in real-time to English, which will then be translated into French. Red Lobster in Ontario court about U.S. bankruptcy A lawyer for Red Lobster Canada, Inc. says he will ask an Ontario court today to recognize and enforce the chain’s U.S. bankruptcy protection proceedings, a process which documents show could include selling Canadian assets. An affidavit filed in an Ontario court from the chief executive of Red Lobster Management LLC says the goal of the U.S.proceedings is to orchestrate a sale of most or all of the company’s assets, including those owned by Red Lobster Canada. The filing from Jonathan Tibus says the seafood restaurant company operates 27 Canadian locations across Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and has 2,000 Canadian employees, who are mostly part-time and non-unionized. Gildan shareholders to vote on board Gildan Activewear Inc. shareholders will have a chance this morning to weigh in on a slate of directors put forward by activist investors. Shareholders of the Montreal-based apparel manufacturing company will be able to vote on whether the eight nominees should be elected to the board. Included in the group is Glenn Chamandy, Gildan’s co-founder, who took the helm of the company last week after being ousted from the top job last year amid accusations that he was no longer fit to run the firm. Activist shareholders, including Browning West, pushed for Chamandy’s return for months, even as former Fruit of the Loom executive Vince Tyra took over Gildan’s CEO post. Pregnant people with disabilities face care gaps A new report says one in eight people who are pregnant in Ontario has a disability, but many face barriers to accessible care, as well as disrespectful attitudes from doctors and other care providers. Lead author Hilary Brown from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences says people with disabilities have been overlooked in reproductive health care because of societal assumptions that they won’t have children. Brown says some disabled participants in the study told researchers that nurses and doctors assumed they wanted to get abortions when they were seeking pregnancy care. The report published on Tuesday calls for more education and training about disabilities for physicians, nurses and other care providers who work with pregnant people. New grassland conservation area in southeast B.C. The Nature Conservancy of Canada says a new conservation area north of Cranbrook, B.C., will protect important bird habitat and preserve grasslands in the province’s southeast. The conservancy says money from the federal government and private donors went to buying up 271 hectares of land in the Skookumchuk Prairie in the province’s southeast corner. Richard Klafki, a B.C. program director with the Nature Conservancy, says the land which also includes wetlands and forests is a “key biodiversity area,” and came up for sale when the former owner, a local rancher, decided to downsize. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 28, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Subscribe to our FREE Newsletter , or Telegram and WhatsApp channels for the latest stories and updates. Residents of Kampung Sri Makmur in Gombak saw their houses getting demolished on Monday, 27 May 2024 to make way for a new condominium development. They claimed the Selangor government had rushed them out of their home before their housing loans for the Selangorku replacement homes were approved. According to Scoop , the residents were given RM1,000 as compensation last Friday with an urgent demand to vacate their homes within three days. However, the loans for the replacement homes in Sri Temenggung have not been approved, putting residents in a dilemma. To rub salt in the wound, some residents claimed they did not get the cash compensation despite meeting the eligible criteria. They have no choice but to seek shelter in a nearby surau that’s scheduled to be demolished soon or temporarily stay with a family member elsewhere. Penduduk Kampung Sri Makmur, Gombak, hanya mampu mengalir air mata melihat rumah yang mereka duduki sejak sekian lama dirobohkan pagi tadi. Tiada kata yang mampu mereka ucapkan apatah lagi dalam keadaan tiada tempat untuk dituju. Tanah berkenaan adalah milik Perbadanan Kemajuan... pic.twitter.com/HfhODG1xHP The land Kampung Sri Makmur is on actually belongs to the State Development Corporation of Selangor (PKNS) and plans to have a condominium built there have been in the works for years. The residents were allegedly given the first notice to move in 2006. While some residents moved to new homes under the Program Setinggan Sifar , the rest stayed due to financial constraints. The residents allegedly received a second notice to move in 2018. When they remained, they were allegedly taken to court in 2020. On 18 August 2023, the court ordered the residents to fully vacate the land before 31 August 2023. The residents who were adamant about staying tried to serve a memorandum to the Selangor Menteri Besar Dato Seri Amirudin Shari several times so their plight could be heard. We didn’t come to ask for money. We just want him to understand our plight and help us. After the protest outside Sultan Sallahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah building (SSAAS), the group passed the memorandum to Amirudin’s special officer, Shahril Said. Kampung Sri Makmur residents asked for two choices : to be allowed to move to the same area if the condominium project unit is valued below RM150,000 or be provided help with relocation to Rumah Pangsa Seri Temenggong under the Rumah Selangorku initiative. They also sought permission to remain in the area while the project is being built or for each family to be given RM700 in compensation until the Rumah Selangorku housing project is completed. We understand PKNS has the right to make us move. We have been to court about the matter but at least let us stay until our housing crisis is sorted. Noora said although PKNS offered housing choices, the prices were more than residents could afford and their limited income hindered them from successfully getting loans. Noora said some residents were open to moving to Sri Temenggong flats and paying rent. She reiterated that the residents were not asking for free homes. According to Malaysiakini, 72 families remained in Kampung Sri Makmur as of 2023, some of whom have been residing there since 1989. Residents tried and failed to hand a memorandum to the Selangor state government in Kuala Kubu Bharu on 4 May 2024. According to Sosialis , the authorities failed to meet the residents to discuss their predicament. The demands of the current memorandum remain the same as the one in 2023.

Прославата заврши, а сега доаѓа време да се засукаат ракавите. Полека се крои новата влада, а веќе ги имаме и првите најави. Новата влада ќе биде составена од ВМРО-ДПМНЕ (58 пратеници), ЗНАМ (6 пратеници) и Вреди – ВЛЕН (14 пратеници). Ако се земе предвид дека и од владејачката коалиција некои се прешалтале во ВМРО-ДПМНЕ тоа значи дека новата влада може да има до 80 пратеници со кои се обезбедува двотретинско мнозинство.Само едно важно министерство кај „Вреди“Според најавите кадрите на „Вреди“ се очекува да седнат на раководните позиции во министерствата за здравство, труд и социјална политика, економија, евроинтеграции и животна средина, а коалицијата ќе добие и вицепремиерска позиција. Министер за здравство се најавува дека ќе биде Арбен Таравари од Алијанса за Албанците. Од овие министерства единствено важно е ова за здравство, другите сите се „чамче министерства“ неважни при составувањето во новата влада.Македонците си ги враќаат клучните министерстваМАКЕДОНСКИОТ НАРОД НАЗАД СИ ГИ ВРАЌА КЛУЧНИТЕ МИНИСТЕРСТВА кои досега беа кај Албанци – МНР, ФИНАНСИИ, ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ И ПРАВДА. МНР, Финансии и образование одат во рацете на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ, а Правда кај партијата на Максим Димитриевски - ЗНАМ. Во меѓувреме, ќе се формира и ново министерство за рударство и енергетика со кое ќе раководи ВМРО-ДПМНЕ. Тоа значи дека ингеренциите од министерството за Економија ќе се пренесат кај Македонци во ова ново министерство, клучните работи ќе се извадат од таму и концесиите ќе ги дава минситер на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ. Фотоволтаици, ископ, сите такви концесии ќе одат од таму, а не од економија. Со тоа значи дека ќе се нормализираат многу работи во државава. Освен овие министерства, наши луѓе ќе раководат и со министерствата за внатрешни работи (веројатно најважна функција), финансии (сите вработувања се преку нив), транспорт и врски, образование (после Мила Царовска првпат кај Македонец), култура, земјоделство, локална самоуправа, одбрана и за енергетика. Ќе има и министерство за спорт кое ќе биде во рацете на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ.Гаши на собраниското столчеМожеби не ми е баш мило што Албанците ќе земат спикер во Собрание, но добро е што не добиваат она што бараа како МВР, ослободување на затвореници од монструм (тоа не треба ниту да е тема на муабет). Мислам дека ВМРО-ДПМНЕ при толкав број на пратеници можеше да избоксува спикер да е Македонец. Сепак ако е за утеха, Африм Гаши е доста подобра од опција од Меџити или Касами од албанските политичари. Гаши ми личи на поасален без претензии кон нашите. Уште една добра работа е што Таравари го зема здравство. Знам дека докторите ,,навиваа” тој да е на оваа функција. Доста паметен потег на раководството на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ е тоа што дадоа претседател на Собрание на ВЛЕН затоа што сега тие ќе имаат алиби следните избори кај албанските гласачи одново да го побараат својот глас. Во случај да не дадеа ДУИ ќе ги потопеше на следни избори, затоа ова е политички потег кој веројатно добро ќе се одрази на долг рок.Македонци на челните позицииМи се допаѓа прагматичноста во преговорите од страна на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ. Ем им дадоа барања на Албанците, ем многу помалку од тоа што имале порано. Искрено се радувам дека во државава работите ќе дојдат на свое место ако гледаме дека Македонци повторно ќе се на челните позиции и министерства.Е сега, секогаш има нешто што не ми се допаѓа. Конкретно не ми се допаѓа денешната изјава на првата жена-претседател, новоизбраната Гордана Силјановска Давкова. Денеска Гордана изјави дека „Преспанскиот договор е реалност“, па почна да се вади дека не го прекршила. Со тоа си го прекрши изборното ветување дека нема да го почитува тој договор. За мене секогаш ќе биде Македонија, но да не се лажеме факт е дека Северна ќе си остане за меѓународна употреба. Кој сака да дојде утре тешко дека ќе го поништи. И сѐ ок, само ме чуди што истата Гордана која се лупаше во гради дека е против договорот од Преспа, прва си легна на брашното. Ако веќе планираше да се извинува и да кажува дека не го прекршила договорот, тогаш и во Собрание нека кажеше Северна, па да расчистевме од старт. Вака „пола риба, пола девојка“.Како и да е.

Мислам дека ВМРО-ДПМНЕ при толкав број на пратеници можеше да избоксува спикер да е Македонец. Сепак ако е за утеха, Африм Гаши е доста подобра од опција од Меџити или Касами од албанските политичари. Гаши ми личи на поасален без претензии кон нашите. Уште една добра работа е што Таравари го зема здравство. Знам дека докторите ,,навиваа” тој да е на оваа функција. Доста паметен потег на раководството на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ е тоа што дадоа претседател на Собрание на ВЛЕН затоа што сега тие ќе имаат алиби следните избори кај албанските гласачи одново да го побараат својот глас. Во случај да не дадеа ДУИ ќе ги потопеше на следни избори, затоа ова е политички потег кој веројатно добро ќе се одрази на долг рок. Ми се допаѓа прагматичноста во преговорите од страна на ВМРО-ДПМНЕ. Ем им дадоа барања на Албанците, ем многу помалку од тоа што имале порано. Искрено се радувам дека во државава работите ќе дојдат на свое место ако гледаме дека Македонци повторно ќе се на челните позиции и министерства. Е сега, секогаш има нешто што не ми се допаѓа. Конкретно не ми се допаѓа денешната изјава на првата жена-претседател, новоизбраната Гордана Силјановска Давкова. Денеска Гордана изјави дека „Преспанскиот договор е реалност“, па почна да се вади дека не го прекршила. Со тоа си го прекрши изборното ветување дека нема да го почитува тој договор. За мене секогаш ќе биде Македонија, но да не се лажеме факт е дека Северна ќе си остане за меѓународна употреба. Кој сака да дојде утре тешко дека ќе го поништи. И сѐ ок, само ме чуди што истата Гордана која се лупаше во гради дека е против договорот од Преспа, прва си легна на брашното. Ако веќе планираше да се извинува и да кажува дека не го прекршила договорот, тогаш и во Собрание нека кажеше Северна, па да расчистевме од старт. Вака „пола риба, пола девојка“. Како и да е. Владиниот колач се дели, се надеваме дека ќе дојдат асални луѓе на местото на досегашните. Деновиве нов текст на темава. Боемот 2.0",

        "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The French presidency said restrictions had been eased to let the main pro-independence FLNKS party hold meetings and for local representatives to try to get road barricades removed.",
        "content": "Paris enforced the state of emergency after riots erupted over French plans to reform voting rights in the territory. Several hundred police and military reinforcements have already been sent to New Caledonia, AFP reported. Authorities said another 480 paramilitary gendarmes would leave France for the territory \"within hours\". A night curfew from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am and a ban on alcohol sales will remain, the French government office in New Caledonia said. While the archipelago has been quieter, some disturbances were reported in Vallee-du-Tir district of the main city Noumea. There have been nearly 500 arrests since the unrest started. Long queues of traffic have built up in daylight hours but many roads, including to the international airport, are still closed with hundreds of burned out cars. The airport is to remain closed until June 2. Authorities said 600 police would be used to clear access to the Medipole hospital. The lifting of the blockades is \"the necessary condition for the opening of concrete and serious negotiations\", the French presidency said in a statement, which announced the lifting of the state of emergency from 5:00 am Tuesday (1800 GMT Monday). President Emmanuel Macron flew to the Pacific archipelago on Thursday in a bid to defuse the crisis. The first French tourists were evacuated Saturday from Noumea aboard military aircraft headed for Australia and New Zealand. Australia and New Zealand had already begun repatriating their nationals on Tuesday. In total, around 3,500 troops have been deployed to the archipelago, where two police have died. New Caledonia has been ruled from Paris since the 1800s, but many indigenous Kanaks resent France's power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence. France is planning to give voting rights to thousands of non-indigenous long-term residents, something Kanaks say would dilute the influence of their votes. Macron pledged during his lightning trip to New Caledonia that the planned voting reforms \"will not be forced through\". \"Violence should never be allowed to take root,\" Macron said at the end of his visit. The CCAT pro-independence group organizing the protests has not called off the roadblocks but offered to ease the chaos so that fuel and medicines could be delivered. The FLNKS party reiterated on Saturday its demand for the withdrawal of the voting reforms after meeting with Macron.",

It said that there are still victims under the rubble and that the majority of those killed were women and children. The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. The strike caused a fire in an encampment just west of Rafah in a neighborhood called Tal al-Sultan, where dozens of Palestinians were sheltering. The area was not under Israeli evacuation orders. The strike came days after the United Nations International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli military to end its operation in Rafah. The order was related to one of several provisional measures that South Africa added to a broader case it filed with the ICJ in December against Israel accusing it of genocide. It also ordered Israel to open its border with Egypt to let aid in and allow a U.N. fact finding mission to enter to investigate accusations of war crimes.

The jury has to consider 34 charges against the Republican nominee. If they find Trump guilty, he could face prison time. The team at NPR's Trump's Trials podcast spoke to former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman, who breaks down three broad possible conclusions the jury could reach. 1. Trump is found guilty If the jury finds Trump guilty of all 34 counts, he would be eligible for a prison sentence. But Litman says there's \"no chance, as I see it, he's actually incarcerated before November.\" That's because sentencing hearings are typically scheduled a few months after the verdict. Litman says even if Judge Juan Merchan chooses to give Trump a couple months in prison, it wouldn't happen right away.

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike killed 45 Palestinians in an encampment for displaced people toggle caption Anas Baba/NPR RAFAH, Gaza — The Gaza health ministry said that an airstrike in Rafah on Sunday killed 45 Palestinians and injured dozens more. It said that there are still victims under the rubble and that the majority of those killed were women and children. The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. The strike caused a fire in an encampment just west of Rafah in a neighborhood called Tal al-Sultan, where dozens of Palestinians were sheltering. The area was not under Israeli evacuation orders. The strike came days after the United Nations International Court of Justice ordered the Israeli military to end its operation in Rafah. The order was related to one of several provisional measures that South Africa added to a broader case it filed with the ICJ in December against Israel accusing it of genocide. It also ordered Israel to open its border with Egypt to let aid in and allow a U.N. fact finding mission to enter to investigate accusations of war crimes.

The jury has to consider 34 charges against the Republican nominee. If they find Trump guilty, he could face prison time. The team at NPR's Trump's Trials podcast spoke to former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman, who breaks down three broad possible conclusions the jury could reach. 1. Trump is found guilty If the jury finds Trump guilty of all 34 counts, he would be eligible for a prison sentence. But Litman says there's \"no chance, as I see it, he's actually incarcerated before November.\" That's because sentencing hearings are typically scheduled a few months after the verdict. Litman says even if Judge Juan Merchan chooses to give Trump a couple months in prison, it wouldn't happen right away.

        "content": "WARNING: Distressing content A counsellor was able to sexually abuse troubled youths referred to his clinic by courts and state officials after police failed to investigate an earlier complaint, a jury has heard. Allan Keith Huggins is accused of molesting 13 vulnerable teenage boys in Sydney and the rural New South Wales town of Armidale from 1977 to 1986. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today He is alleged to have either sexually touched or raped the teens at a youth centre for troubled boys, as well as at a school and his private practices. Police and a local bishop did not believe two of the alleged victims when they came forward to make their complaints, Sydney’s Downing Centre District Court was previously told. The trial continued on Tuesday, when jurors heard two Armidale children were referred to Huggins by court and state officials before they were allegedly abused. Crown prosecutor David Patch said a nine-year-old boy was referred to the counsellor in the 1980s after his mother contacted NSW departmental officials. The boy was allegedly sexually touched and masturbated by Huggins. On one occasion, the youth also believed the counsellor masturbated behind him as he faced a wall in the clinic, Patch said. Although the alleged victim approached police and made a statement in 1990, that document had disappeared and nobody knew where it had gone, the jury was told. Another alleged victim, who now identifies as a woman, was over 16 years old when she was referred to Huggins after coming before a children’s court magistrate. Patch said the counsellor used his authority to force the teen into sexual activity. “You need a good report for the courts; just relax, you’re all right ,” he allegedly told the teenager. On one occasion he sucked the teen’s genitals, to which she said “stop, stop” while the alleged assault continued, the jury heard. After that, the counsellor again tried to exert his influence, the prosecutor said. “If you tell your mum, she won’t believe you,” the counsellor allegedly said. The teen and Huggins later had consensual sex, but on one occasion he was too aggressive, Patch said. She had to get new clothes as her pants were left full of faeces and blood, the court heard. She buried the underwear she was wearing at the time under her home in a plastic bag, which was recovered by police in 2014. Huggins, who is now in his 70s, has pleaded not guilty to 42 charges, including indecent assault, sexual assault and sexual intercourse without consent. Other allegations against him include that he fondled the genitals of two brothers after they appeared in his private practice. Another boy was summoned to Huggins’ office at school, where he was allegedly raped despite making a noise due to the pain, the jury heard. “The accused covered his mouth with his hands so (the boy) had trouble breathing,” Patch said. Jurors previously heard Huggins groomed his alleged victims through “relaxation” techniques that involved the teens stripping down and being touched. In the 1990s, the counsellor relocated to Western Australia, where he worked with the state government to find employment for homeless and vulnerable teens. He was charged and pleaded guilty to one count of indecent dealing when he massaged and inappropriately touched a 15-year-old boy in an Albany hotel room, the court was told. Huggins’ barrister, Roland Keller, did not make opening submissions. The trial before Judge Penelope Hock continues.

Çoğunlukla 5-15 yaş arası çocuklarda görülen, yanaklarda oluşan döküntülerden dolayı ‘tokat yemiş gibi' kıpkırmızı bir görünüm oluşturan parvovirüs B19 yani beşinci hastalık son günlerde sıklıkla gündeme geliyor. Türk Pediatri Kurumu Derneği Başkanı, Çocuk Alerji ve İmmünoloji Uzmanı Prof. Dr. Haluk Çokuğraş da hastalığın belirtileri ve oluşturduğu etkilere yönelik bilgi verdi. Prof. Dr. Çokuğraş, beşinci hastalıkla karıştırılabilecek hastalıklara ilişkin bilgi verirken ailelere de uyarılarda bulundu. “Şu sıralarda artış gösterdi, bu sene birazcık daha fazla var” Beşinci hastalığın çocuğun yanağında tokat izine benzer bir kızarıklığa neden olduğunu söyleyen Prof. Dr. Haluk Çokuğraş, “Beşinci hastalık aslında son derece basit bir virüs enfeksiyonudur. Her sene özellikle okul mevsimlerinde, sonbahar, kış, ilkbahar aylarında büyük çocuklarda 5-15 yaş arasında parvovirüs B19 dediğimiz bir virüsle ortaya çıkan döküntülü bir hastalıktır. Döküntüsü son derece tipiktir, aslında pek bir şeyle karıştırılmaz, bu işten anlayan birisi hemen tanır. Nasıl bir döküntü olur; iki yanak tokat yemiş gibi kızarır. Döküntü; kolların, bacakların dış yüzeylerindedir. Giderek bir dantel halini alır, girintili, çıkıntılı bir döküntüdür. Bu döküntüler hecme hecme gelir, önce bir döküntü olur, geçiyor galiba dersiniz, bir daha olur, arkadan bir daha olur ve bu aşağı yukarı 1 hafta kadar sürer. Eşlik eden hafif bir ateş bazen olabilir, hiç olmayabilir, bazen de kaşıntılı olabilir. Bu ateşin olmaması, bazen biraz kaşıntılı olması bu hastalığın alerjik hastalıklarla karışmasına gerçekten neden olabilir ki bunu yaşıyoruz. ‘Turşu yedi, şunu yedi de yüzü kızardı' diye gelen pek çok hasta oluyor. Beşinci hastalık şu sıralarda gerçekten bir artış gösterdi, bunu hem kendi pratiğimde görüyorum hem de başka arkadaşlardan duyuyorum. Her sene bu mevsimde vardır ama bu sene birazcık daha fazla var. Çok basit bir hastalıktır, bir komplikasyonu neredeyse yok gibidir ama nadiren bağışıklık sistemi bozuk kişilerde birtakım kansızlıklara yol açabilir. Okul çocuklarını tutar, bazen erişkinlerde de olabilir. Erişkin kadınlarda olduğu zaman eklem komplikasyonları olabilir. Döküntünün yayılımı gövdeyi pek tutmaz. Yanakta kızarıklık olması nedeniyle bazen kızılla karıştırılabilir ama kızılın döküntüsü bütün gövdeyi tutar sadece yanaklarda değildir. Bütün vücut bazen mürekkep sürülmüş gibi kırmızı olabilir, çok daha yüksek ateşi vardır” dedi. “Bu hastalıkta antibiyotik asla kullanılmaz, Türkiye hala antibiyotiğin en kötü kullanıldığı ülke” Beşinci hastalık görülmesi durumunda yapılacaklara ilişkin tavsiyelerde bulunan Prof. Dr. Çokuğraş, “Bulaşabilir ama bir kızamık gibi aşırı bulaşıcı değildir. Birkaç gün evde istirahat etmesi eğer kaşıntıları fazla varsa nadiren olur, belki kaşıntı giderici bir antihistaminik ilaç birkaç gün kullanılabilir. Ateşi olursa bir ateş düşürücü kullanılabilir, antibiyotik asla kullanılmaz. Bu beşinci hastalıktır, bir de altıncı hastalık var; 3 yaşından küçük çocuklarda genellikle 6 aylıkla 2 yaş arasındaki çocuklarda gözüken bu da bir döküntülü hastalık. Ama nasıl bir döküntülü hastalık; o da çok tipiktir. 3 gün kadar çok yüksek bir ateş olur, 39-40 derece hatta bazen havale bile geçirebilir, o kadar yüksek olabilir. Başka da bir fizik muayene bulgusu genellikle yoktur. Şaşırırsınız, ne oluyor bu çocuğa, neden ateşi var diye bir sürü tetkikler bazen yapılabilir ama 3'üncü günün sonunda ateş birdenbire düşer ve kızamığa benzer bir döküntü çıkar. Bütün vücudu tutar ince bir döküntü sadece 24 saat sürer ve oda geçer. Burada dikkat çekici olan şey; çocuğun yaşıdır. Bir ilacı yok, çocuklar sadece semptomatik tedavi görüyor. Burada kafa karıştırıcı olabilecek şeyler; bu döküntülü hastalıklar sırasında yanlış yere antibiyotik ya da başka birtakım ilaçlar kullanıyorsanız bu döküntüleri bazen ilaç alerjisi diye yorumlayabilirsiniz, onun için dikkatli olmak lazım. Her şeyden önce de antibiyotiği çok dikkatli kullanmamamız gerekir. Türkiye hala antibiyotiğin en kötü kullanıldığı ülke geçen sene birinciliği Yunanistan'a kaptırmıştık. Bu sene tekrar geri aldık, maalesef her ateşli hastalıkta antibiyotik kullanmak oluşabilecek belirtileri yorumlarken bizi de zorluyor. Yüksek ateşli durumlarda doktora danışmak en iyisi” şeklinde konuştu. “Bunlar bulaşıcı hastalıklar, olduğunda başka çocuklardan uzak tutmaları lazım” El, ayak, ağız hastalığına ilişkin de konuşan Prof. Dr. Çokuğraş, sözlerini şöyle sürdürdü:“El, ayak, ağız hastalığı eskiden beri bildiğimiz bir hastalık, dönem dönem birtakım artışlar olabiliyor. Ateş olabilir, tipik ellerde özellikle avuç içlerinde ayak tabanlarında, ağız içinde ve ağız çevresinde birtakım döküntüler, kabarcıklarla ya da yaralarla gidebilen bir hastalıktır. Bazen çok ciddi ateş de yapabilir. Tek bir virüsün yaptığı bir hastalık değil, birkaç farklı virüsün yaptığı hastalık, bunların bazıları salgınlar yapabilir. Özellikle Uzak Doğu'da yakın zamanda böyle salgınlar yaşanmıştır. Tanı koymak zor değil, gövdede ve kolda, bacakta pek döküntü olmaz. Daha çok el ve ayaklarda olur ama az da olsa kollarda da döküntü olduğu bir takım atipik vakalar da olabilir. Bütün bu virüs hastalıklarının spesifik bir tedavisi yok. El ayak ağız hastalığında ağızın içinde o yaralar, lezyonlar olduğu zaman o çocukların beslenmesi bozulabilir. Bunlar bulaşıcı hastalıklar böyle bir durum olduğunda başka çocuklardan biraz uzak tutmalarını sağlamak lazım. Mümkün olduğu kadar birkaç gün evde kalmaları faydalı olur. Bu hastalıkların aşıları yok çünkü henüz bulunmadı. Bu çocukların iyi beslenmelerini sağlamak önemli çünkü hastalıklar sırasında çocukların iştahları da kesildiği için hakikaten beslenmeleri bozulabiliyor”",

        "content": "Konut sektöründe bu yıl satışlar gerilerken nakdi olup da konut almak isteyen vatandaşlara Mars International’ın Kurucusu ve CEO’su Hakan Bucak'tan dikkat çeken tavsiyeler geldi. Kredili satışlar da dip seviyelerde bulunurken, satışları nakit domine ediyor. Nakit sahipleri bu dönemde ciddi avantaja sahip. Nakdi olanlar sıkı pazarlıkla ‘doğru fiyata’ ulaşırken, kredi maliyetlerinden de etkilenmiyor. FAİZ DÜŞÜNCE, FİYAT ARTIYOR Posta'da yer alan haberde, Sektör temsilcileri, konut yatırımında nakdi olanlar için bu dönemin doğru zaman olduğuna işaret ediyor. Proje geliştirme, yatırım yönetimi, kurumsal satış ve pazarlama hizmetleri sunan Mars International’ın Kurucusu ve CEO’su Hakan Bucak, sektörde yüksek faizlerden kaynaklı bir durgunluk olduğunu belirterek, “Bana göre gayrimenkul şu anda alınır. Çünkü faizlerin düştüğü dönemde fiyatlar adım adım artmaya başlar. Daha önce gördük, faizler düşmeye başlayınca artan fiyatlar karşımıza çıktı” dedi. ALICIDA STRES BAŞLADI Şu anda piyasada alıcıların bulunduğunu ancak alımların ertelendiğini ifade eden Bucak, şunları söyledi: “Bu ertelemenin getirdiği bir stres de söz konusu. Çocuğunuzu evlendiriyorsunuz, deprem nedeniyle yeni konuta geçmeye çalışıyorsunuz ama fiyatların düşmediğini görüyorsunuz. Dolar bazlı bir miktar düşüş olabilir ancak büyük bir gerileme beklemiyoruz. İstanbul’da Etiler, Beykoz, Zekeriyaköy gibi döviz odaklı bölgelerde de fiyatlar kolay kolay düşmez. Hatta faiz oranları dengelendiğinde, bugünkü fiyatları arıyor olacağız.” LÜKSTE SORUN YOK Ultra lüks projelerde ise satış probleminin olmadığını dile getiren Bucak, şöyle konuştu: “Metrekaresi 15 bin Euro’dan satılıyor, peşin fiyatına hem de. Dünyada da bu trend devam ediyor. Ancak lüks konutta yeterli stoğun olduğunu düşünüyorum. Bununla birlikte, lüks gayrimenkul yatırımcılarının ihtiyaçlarını tam anlamıyla karşılayan az sayıda proje bulunduğunu görmekteyiz. Lüks gayrimenkul tarafında, doğru tasarımla proje üreten geliştiricilerin satış stresi yaşamadığını gözlemliyoruz.” TÜRKLERİN YURTDIŞINDAN ALIMI YABANCIYA SATIŞI GEÇECEK Yabancı alımlarındaki akışın da deprem, şeffaflık, insan kaynağı problemleri nedeniyle bozulduğunu anlatan Bucak, Dubai örneğini verdi. Dubai’de devletin bütün datayı online olarak paylaştığını ifade eden Bucak, şöyle konuştu: “Dubai şeffaf olmasının karşılığı ile gayrimenkulden yılda 100 milyar dolar kazanıyor. Bize 3.5 milyar dolar geliyor. Ama 2.8 milyar dolar da Türkler dışarıdan konut alıyor. Size kalıyor 700 milyon dolar. Hatta bu yıl yurtdışından alım yapan Türklerin sayısının Türkiye’den ev alan yabancı sayısını geçeceğini düşünüyoruz.” YATIRIMDAN UZAKLAŞTILAR 2 yıl önce bazı semtlerde yabancı sınırının yüzde 25’le sınırlandırılması sonrası, büyük yatırımlar yapan yabancıların da zorlandığını belirten Bucak, ikametgah sınırı uygulanırken yatırımcı ayrımının yapılmadığını söyledi. Bucak, “Türkiye’ye çok ciddi yatırımlar yapmış, hatta burada önemli işlere imza atmış yabancılar bile sınıra takıldı. Türkiye’den ayrılanlar oldu. Artık ‘İstanbul’u çok sevsem de Türkiye’den bir daha birşey almayacağım’ diyen yatırımcılarımız var. İstanbul’da lüks otellerde kalıp yine de ev almıyorlar” diye anlattı.",

        "description": "In December 2023, Nigerien authorities announced the termination of the EU Capacity-Building (EUCAP) Sahel Niger and the EU Military Partnership Mission in Niger (EUMPM). This came as part of the authorities' review of all military agreements signed by the government of President Mohamed Bazoum, who was overthrown by the army in July 2023.",
        "content": "The European Council announced on Monday that it had decided not to extend its Military Partnership Mission in Niger (EUMPM) in Niger beyond June 30, 2024. The EUMPM contingent, which was established in 2022 at the request of the former Nigerien authorities, consists of between 50 and 100 soldiers and is responsible for providing logistical and infrastructural support to the West African country's army. It's worth noting that the United States began withdrawing its troops from Niger's territory in March after Niamey terminated its military agreement with Washington. On May 19, the two nations agreed that the withdrawal of American soldiers from Niger would be completed by September 15 at the latest. Previously, Niger's military rulers had pressured former colonial power France to withdraw its military forces from the country.",

        "description": "AGI - Torna in carcere Elmahdi Halili, il 29enne marocchino legato all'Isis considerato l'ideologo della Jihad in Italia. Gli agenti della Questura di Torino hanno arrestato il giovane di Lanzo Torinese per partecipazione ad associazione terroristica internazionale, a conclusione di un'indagine della Digos, coordinata dalla Procura del capoluogo piemontese. Halili era già stato arrestato due volte, nel 2015 e nel 2018. Era stato condannato nel 2019, con una sentenza divenuta irrevocabile nel 2022, per la sua adesione all'organizzazione terroristica dello Stato Islamico e per il suo ruolo di 'ideologo' della Jihad in Italia. A fine luglio del 2023 era stato scarcerato, ma per intoppi burocratici non era stato espulso, pur essendogli stata revocata la cittadinanza italiana. Durante la detenzione a Torino e Sassari e dopo il ritorno in libertà, secondo gli investigatori, il 29enne ha rafforzato il suo credo fondamentalista, dichiarando con orgoglio di continuare ad appartenere all'Isis e manifestando più volte propositi bellicosi e violenti. A febbraio si era appreso dall'imam di Torino, Gabriele Lungo, che viveva in strada nel capoluogo piemontese, abbandonato dalla famiglia e in condizioni di disagio sia materiale sia psicologico. Ad aprile l'ambasciatore per l'Italia del Ran (Radicalisation awareness network) della Commissione europea, Luca Guglielmini, aveva suggerito che Halili fosse inserito in una comunità: \"Più vive ai margini e più è pericoloso\", aveva avvertito. L'indagine che aveva portato all'arresto e alla condanna di Halili era nata a fine 2015, quando appena ventenne aveva patteggiato a Brescia due anni di reclusione con la condizionale per istigazione a delinquere con finalità di terrorismo in relazione a documenti di esaltazione dell'Isis postati in Rete. In seguito aveva intensificato la sua attività di proselitismo e indottrinamento su varie piattaforme multimediali con materiale di propaganda inneggiante al Jihad prodotto dallo Stato Islamico. Nel 2018, quando abitava a Ciriè, nel Torinese, la Digos gli aveva sequestrato in casa istruzioni su come utilizzare le armi bianche oppure preparare un camion bomba. Fu Elmahdi a firmare il primo testo in italiano dell'Isis, \"Lo Stato islamico, una realtà che ti vorrebbe comunicare\", finito all'attenzione dei nostri 007 tra la fine del 2014 e l'inizio del 2015. \"Ho deciso di scrivere questo testo - scriveva Halili nell'introduzione - per cercare di presentare in modo riassuntivo una realtà di cui si parla molto: lo Stato Islamico che tutti conoscono attraverso i media accusatori ma non tramite i media degli accusati\". Nel pdf di 64 pagine con grafici, interviste e spiegazioni si elogiava la vita sotto l'Isis nelle zone dove, \"grazie all'applicazione della Sharia e delle punizioni regolate dal Libro di Allah\", si è instaurata una \"reale sicurezza\".",

        "content": "Cases of stalking are on the rise with little response from the police (Photo: flickr/Patrik Nygren) The numbers of victims asking for support and advice about stalking offences has skyrocketed dramatically, a leading char­ity revealed. The National Stalking Helpline, run by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, has said calls to its hotlines have shot up by a massive 47 percent this year. The trust defines stalking as, “A pattern of fixated and obsessive behaviour which is repeated, persistent, intrusive and causes fear of violence or engenders alarm and distress in the victim.” The helpline said that it had already supported 832 people this year, com­pared to 564 at the same time last year. Tallulah Belassie-Page from the trust said, “Our ongoing campaigning that started in this year’s National Stalking Awareness Week means that more victims feel empowered to come forward.” Huge numbers of people are impacted by stalking offences—British Crime Survey statistics show that some five million people are stalked every year. It’s estimated that 20 percent of women and 10 percent of men experience it at some point in their lives. But because of the repeated ways that victims are failed by the criminal justice system, it is impossible to know the true scale of the crime. An estimated 64 percent of vic­tims are women, but this figure is likely muddied by differences in how men and women report the crime. Many will be turned away by the cops before they can even file an official report. One woman, who was stalked for eight years, said a series of terrifying encounters were dismissed by cops. “I lived every day in fear,” she said. “The police took each incident in isolation and didn’t recognise the pattern of behaviour. “I often felt victim-shamed and like I wasn’t taken seriously. “At one point I had a panic attack and a breakdown in the police station because they wouldn’t help me. “I cried and said, ‘All I want is my safety.’ It’s changed me fundamentally.” Despite being dismissed, belittled and put in harm’s way by the police, it was later established that her stalker was known to police and had done this before. Stalking victims experience similar treatment at every level of the criminal justice system. Just 1.7 percent of stalking cases result in a conviction. A Freedom of Information (FOI) request submit­ted by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust shows that police forces aren’t using existing legal measures available to them. The FOI showed Stalking Protection Orders (SPO), which are designed to prevent perpetrators from contacting victims, were rarely used by the police. Some 12 police forces applied for fewer than ten SPOs and only three forces that replied to the FOI applied for more than 30. Another victim of stalk­ing reported that it took the police nine months to put an interim SPO in place, and only once an independ­ent advocate asked for it. “The perpetrator has since breached it and a month later, there has been no response from the police. “I had to send the police officer a copy of the SPO because he didn’t actually have it, he didn’t know. I don’t have the energy to fight the police and the stalker at the same time.” The treatments of victims from the cops and the courts should come as no surprise. The crimes of cops Dave Carrick, a serial rapist, and Wayne Couzens, the murderer of Sarah Everard, sparked fur­ther investigations. They reveal the misogynis­tic culture embedded in every single police force. Last year, the wide-rang­ing Casey report dubbed Britain’s biggest police force, the Met Police, as institution­ally racist, homophobic and misogynistic. Victims cannot hope to find justice in this system. It protects abusers within its own ranks and under­mines, re-traumatises and brushes aside all ordinary people, particularly women, at every turn.

        "description": "\"Ho bussato alla porta dell'inferno\". L'ex centrocampista dell'Inter ha parlato della sua dipendenza dall'alcol in un'intervista alla rivista colombiana Semana",
        "content": "Fredy Guarin sta combattendo la sua battaglia per porre fine alla sua dipendenza dall' alcol . Un vortice che troppo spesso travolge i calciatori quando appendono le scarpette al chiodo. I tifosi dell' Inter lo ricordano per il gran tiro della distanza e qualche pausa di troppo in mezzo al campo. Furono proprio i tifosi ad impedirne il passaggio alla Juventus con una dura contestazione, nel famoso scambio con Vucinic. L'ex centrocampista colombiano ha vestito la maglia nerazzurra, dal 2012 al 2016, collezionando 114 presenze e 15 gol, tra cui una rete decisiva nel derby del 2015 contro il Milan. Dopo tre stagioni trascorse a Shanghai, in Cina, è tornato in Sud America e nel 2021 si è ritirato definitivamente. Da quel momento iniziano i problemi. \"Quando ho lasciato il Millonarios ho toccato il punto più basso perché in quegli anni la mia dipendenza è diventata molto seria. Non lavoravo più in allenamento, avevo perso la mia dignità, la fiducia delle persone care e la cosa più importante e preziosa che ho, ovvero i miei tre figli\" , ha raccontato l’ex calciatore in un’intervista alla rivista colombiana Semana. \"Sono un alcolizzato al 100% - ha confessato il colombiano - e lo ammetto. Un tossicodipendente in via di guarigione\" . Poi la decisione di farsi seguire da specialisti: \"In passato avevo provato a uscire da questa dipendenza, ma non c’ero mai riuscito e ho sempre avuto una dipendenza. Per questo mi sono arreso e sono stato costretto a chiedere aiuto ad alcuni professionisti con cui sto lavorando per rimettere a posto le cose, per riacquistare la fiducia dei miei figli, dei miei parenti e dei miei amici. Stavolta è diverso rispetto al passato e penso che questa sia la volta buona. Ho già bussato alla porta del diavolo e non è il massimo. So già quale non è la strada: la mia strada è Dio che mi dà ogni giorno forza, una vita sobria e sana \". Una storia che ricorda quella di Adriano , che dopo la scomparsa del padre, iniziò a fare i conti con l'alcol. Guarin non ha specificato cosa ha scatenato la dipendenza e si è limitato a dire che \"purtroppo a un certo punto mi sono lasciato 'distrarre' e mi sono aggrappato all’alcol. Ho commesso molti errori, ho preso decisioni sbagliate, ho ferito molte persone. L’alcol è sempre stato il fattore scatenante per tutto ciò che mi accadeva. Il giorno in cui è avvenuto l’episodio della lite a casa con i miei genitori, i poliziotti non mi hanno portato in prigione : sono stati gentili, mi hanno messo in macchina, ma non mi hanno ammanettato né maltrattato. Sono stati professionali\". Infine Guarin ha parlato delle sue paure: \" La morte e il carcere. Fino a poco tempo fa, con l’alcol, era come se vivessi in un carcere, condannato a morte. Ho bussato alle porte dell’inferno\" .",

The Internet Archive, the largest digital library globally, is battling with the escalating issue of a problem known as \"link rot,\" the phenomenon of disappearing web pages.

A recent study by the Pew Research Center revealed that 38% of web pages that existed in 2013 have disappeared, and 8% of those from 2023 are now missing. The study also discovered that 54% of Wikipedia pages link to non-existent pages in their references section. This problem is widespread on government and news pages.

Social media behemoths like Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and Instagram , and Elon Musk's X , formerly Twitter , have strict viewing restrictions, making archiving challenging. Subscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox. Additionally, the emergence of bots that post and interact with posts, known as \"sludge,\" complicates the collection of significant parts of the internet. Why It Matters : Link rot is a growing problem that affects the longevity of hyperlinks on the internet. Over time, hyperlinks deteriorate and become inactive and inaccessible, creating challenges for users seeking valid and valuable information on the internet. Tech billionaire Musk has voiced his support for the Internet Archive, calling it a \"public good that should exist.\" Check out more of Benzinga’s Consumer Tech coverage by following this link .

        "content": "Despite its challenging terrain and sparse population, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) have achieved 100% teledensity, according to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). This impressive feat highlights the region’s access to voice and data communications services. Teledensity measures the number of fixed (landline) telephone connections per 100 people in a specific area. PTA use it as a key indicator to compare access levels to communication services between urban and rural areas, or among different countries. Enhancing and strengthening telecom infrastructure and services in AJ&K and GB has been a priority for the PTA and the Government of Pakistan. Today, competition exists in all telecom services, including mobile broadband, fixed broadband, Fiber to The Home (FTTH), and fixed line services. According to the PTA, this achievement would not have been possible without the trust placed in the incumbent operator, the Special Communication Organization (SCO), and other telecom operators by the six million mobile subscribers in the region. The concerted efforts of these operators have played a significant role in reaching this milestone. In addition to mobile broadband, residents of AJ&K and GB have access to various broadband services such as FTTH, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), and Wireless Local Loop (WLL). People widely utilize these services for e-education, e-commerce, e-health, and other applications, contributing to the socio-economic uplift of the region. Following international best practices, the PTA has identified Telenor as a Significant Market Power (SMP) operator in the mobile market of AJ&K and GB. This designation regulates Telenor to maintain competitive tariffs for consumers, fostering a healthy competitive environment in the telecom sector. To improve coverage and ensure quality telecom services for consumers, the PTA mandates mobile operators to install a minimum of six telecom towers each year under their license terms. These operators also adhere to defined service quality thresholds, with independent and joint Quality of Service (QoS) surveys conducted regularly to monitor compliance. This system lets users register complaints and seek redressal, ensuring prompt and effective addressing of their concerns. The region’s journey towards achieving 100% teledensity is a testament to the collaborative efforts of the PTA, telecom operators, and the government. Despite geographical challenges, the commitment to improving telecom infrastructure and services has paid off, bringing modern communication facilities to even the most remote areas. The success of AJ&K and GB serves as a model for other regions facing similar challenges. This demonstrates that the right policies, regulatory frameworks, and cooperation from all stakeholders can significantly expand access to communication services. This achievement not only enhances connectivity but also paves the way for further socio-economic development, bridging the digital divide and providing opportunities for growth and advancement in these regions. As AJ&K and GB continue to evolve, the focus will remain on maintaining and improving the quality of telecom services, ensuring that the benefits of 100% teledensity are fully realized by all residents. This ongoing commitment will help sustain the progress made and support the continued development of these regions.

        "content": "The Philippine Obstacle Sports Federation (POSF) braces for a tough schedule ahead as the national team plunges into action in different international tournaments, including the OCR World Championship set in Costa Rica in August. The Philippine Obstacle Sports Federation (POSF) braces for a tough schedule ahead as the national team plunges into action in different international tournaments, including the OCR World Championship set in Costa Rica in August. POSF President Alberto Agra has high hopes that the local athletes can further excel in the sport that is being dominated by the country in regional meets. In the Southeast Asian Games alone, the Filipinos have pocketed a total of 10 gold medals from the 2019 and 2023 editions. In last year’s world championship, the Philippines bagged 12 medals highlighted by Kevin Pascua’s golden performance in the men’s 100-m elite finals. The national federation is keen on sending 18 athletes that will compete in ninja, obstacle course short and long categories in the Asia-Pacific Championship hosted by Malaysia in July. “Right now we have eight national teams under POSF, [and] ang ipapadala po for sure ay ‘yong mga national athletes recognized and supported by PSC, these are 18 athletes in ninja, obstacle course short and long,” Agra said in Tuesday's PSA Forum presented by San Miguel Corporation, Philippine Sports Commission, Philippine Olympic Committee, MILO, Smart/PLDT, and ArenaPlus. The international campaign comes as the obstacle course is not yet certain if it would be included in the calendar of events of next year’s 33rd Southeast Asian Games in Thailand.",

        "content": "به گزارش از زاهدان، رضا شریفی در جلسه ستاد ساماندهی امور جوانان استان با گرامیداشت یاد و نام شهیدان راه خدمت به ویژه شهید جمهور، آیت الله سید ابراهیم رییسی و همراهان انقلابی ایشان اظهار داشت: مسئولان، مدیران بانک‌های خصوصی و همه دستگاه‌های متولی در راستای اجرای مصوبات این جلسه پیگیر باشند. معاون سیاسی و اجتماعی استاندار سیستان و بلوچستان تصریح کرد: فضا‌سازی مناسب با توجه به ایام و مناسبت‌ها به خصوص توسط شهرداری‌ها استمرار یابد. در برگزاری مراسمات سازمان‌ها و مجموعه‌های فرهنگی، دانشگاه و آموزش و پرورش و نهادهای مردمی هم کمک کنید. وی با بیان اینکه مصوبات جلسات باید با جدیت پیگیری شود، گفت: ازدواج، فرزند‌آوری و تحکیم خانواده یک دغدغه راهبردی است و مصوبات جلسه با توجه به اهمیت موضوع، باید با جدیت توسط مسئولان پیگیری و به نتیجه برسد. شریفی با تاکید بر استمرار کارهای پژوهشی در حوزه ازدواج و تحکیم خانواده، بیان کرد: باید همایشی با حضور مشاوران ازدواج جهت بررسی‌ بیشتر موضوعات برگزار شود. شریفی اذعان کرد: قرار بود شهید جمهور چند روز قبل به استان سیستان و بلوچستان بیایند که ما برای این حضور بسیار خوشحال و علاقمند بودیم زیرا افتتاحیه‌های خاصی قرار بود در سطح استان اتفاق بیفتد، اکنون نیز روح ایشان شاهد و ناظر عملکرد ما و شما است. نگه داشتن یاد و خاطره شهدا حائز اهمیت است و بهترین نوع زنده نگه داشتن یاد و خاطره شهدا این است که در عمل پیرو این مسیر بوده و در صادق وعده‌ها و حرفهایمان صادق باشیم. معاون استاندار بیان داشت: روزی دوران خدمت و مسئولیت ما هم تمام خواهد شد، بس چه بهتر که گره‌گشای امور مسلمین و مردم باشیم. شریفی با اشاره به اتفاقات تشییع شهدای اردیبهشت گفت: برخی‌ها برای حلالیت از این شهدا آمده بودند. شهید امیرعبداللهیان یک وزیر انقلابی بودند، شهدای پرواز اردیبهشت انسان‌های وارسته و بزرگی بودند و ما برای این نظام مقدس چنین انسانهای وارسته‌ای را از دست داده ایم. معاون استاندار سیستان و بلوچستان با مخاطب قرار دادن مسئولان گفت: ما مدیون این شهدا هستیم و باید به اندازه بضاعت در حد توان مان اجازه ندهیم شرمنده شهدا بشویم. انتهای پیام/",

        "content": "The EV battery manufacturer has bagged $1.5 Mn in an undisclosed funding round from multiple angel investors It will look to use the freshly raised capital for the development and introduction of fast-charging lithium-ion batteries soon Founded in 2019, Maxvolt Energy offers e-cycle, e-scooter and e-rickshaw batteries along with lithium battery energy solutions Electric vehicle battery manufacturer Maxvolt Energy Industries has bagged $1.5 Mn in an undisclosed funding round from multiple angel investors. The company will look to use the freshly raised capital for the development and introduction of fast-charging lithium-ion batteries soon. Maxvolt Energy is working on the development of “world-class” lithium battery architectures for electric bikes, scooters, and solar energy systems. Founded by Bhuvneshwar Pal Singh, Mukesh Gupta, Satendra Shukla and Vishal Gupta in 2019, the company currently offers e-cycle, e-scooter and e-rickshaw batteries along with lithium battery energy solutions. For its batteries, it offers a 100% buyback, 3-year replacement warranty at no extra charges for its batteries. The company operates in a B2B model as well as B2C. It counts the likes of Versatile escooters, Mantra ebikes, Odysse, Ormax, among others, as its B2B partners. On the B2C front, it claims to have a customer base of over 1.5 Lakh. “We are developing a fast-charging solution that will significantly reduce customers’ charging times. In the prototype development phase, the company aims to launch the final product in phases by the end of 2024 after thorough R&D. In the first phase; we will reduce the charging time to 2 hours and 1 hour in the subsequent phase,” said Maxvolt’s CBO Satendra Shukla. The company has seen investor interest at a time when the EV adoption in India is really heating up. Registrations for electric two-wheelers (E2Ws), which have seen the greatest fervour from Indians, in the month of March alone crossed the 1 Lakh mark . Fuelling the electrification on Indian roads is the central government’s push to promote EV adoption in the country. The union government recently launched an INR 500 Cr scheme , the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme 2024, to promote electric mobility from April 1. The new scheme will be in place till the end of July this year. Further, authorities are also working to establish a task force to create a roadmap for the EV industry .",

Baca Juga \"Sekjen Mathias Cormann juga akan bertemu dengan Presiden Terpilih Pak Menhan, Ketua DPR RI, Pimpinan DPR RI, Tim Nasional Aksesi RI, KADIN, Apindo, dan juga akan membuka workshop teknis mengenai aksesi OECD dengan kementerian dan lembaga,\" kata Menteri Koordinator Bidang Perekonomian Airlangga Hartarto usai mendampingi Jokowi di Istana Kepresidenan Bogor, Jawa Barat, Selasa. Advertisement Dia menyampaikan pertemuan Jokowi dan membahas proses aksesi Indonesia menjadi anggota penuh OECD. Airlangga mengatakan pemerintah menyampaikan komitmen bahwa Indonesia dapat menjadi anggota penuh OECD dalam tiga tahun ke depan. Dia menyampaikan Jokowi telah membentuk tim nasional persiapan dan percepatan Keanggotaan Indonesia dalam OECD. Selain itu, Jokowi juga akan membentuk tim untuk aksesi keanggotaan Indonesia di OECD. \"Indonesia berkomitmen jadi anggota OECD dalam 3 tahun. Tadi disampaikan oleh bapak presiden bahwa kita akan membentuk tim untuk itu,\" ujarnya. Airlangga menuturkan aksesi akani terintegrasi dengan rencana pembangunan jangka menengah Indonesia. Dia lantas membandingkan negara-negara lain yang berhasil masuk menjadi anggota OECD. \"Beberapa negara yang masuk OECD ini Kosta Rika dia menurunkan devisitnya jadi 5 persen, padahal jauh lebih rendah dari itu. Indonesia -nya sudah 3 persen,\" jelas dia. \"Kolombia berhasil menurunkan kasus suapnya dan tentu Indonesia sudah jadi anggota daripada FATF dan Lituania juga 3 tahun dan Chile juga 3 tahun (bisa menjadi anggota penuh OECD),\" sambung Airlangga. Menurut dia, Indonesia memiliki waktu 250 hari untuk membuat momerandum. Nantinya, OECD akan membantu Indonesia terkait pengembangan ekosistem semi konduktor dan belajar bagaimana ASEAN menjalankan proses roadmap digital yakni, Digital Economy Framework Agreement. \"Tadi juga disampaikan bahwa OECD juga akan melakukan survei ekonomi Indonesia dan ini salah satu bentuk OECD terhadap bagaimana meningkatkan iklim investasi,\" pungkas Airlangga. Adapun Indonesia telah menjadi mitra OECD sejak 2007 dan berpartisipasi dalam program regional Asia Tenggara sejak 2014. Indonesia telah diterima sebagai negara aksesi OECD bersamaan dengan Argentina dalam OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) yang dipimpin oleh Perdana Menteri Jepang Fumio Kishida di Paris pada 2-3 Mei 2024. Sebelumnya, Presiden Joko Widodo atau Jokowi menyambut baik keputusan 38 negara menerima Indonesia menjadi anggota Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Menurut dia, masuknya Indonesia ke organisasi negara maju akan memudahkan akses investasi. \"Pemerintah sangat mengapresiasi atas telah diterimannya Indonesia sebagai anggota OECD. Ini penting sekali karena ini organisasi untuk megara maju,\" kata Jokowi di Kabupaten Konawe, Sulawesi Tenggara, Kamis (14/5/2024). \"Kita harapkan dengan kita masuk ke sana, akan mudah mengakses ke investasi, mudah mengakses ke lembaga internasional yang bermanfaat bagi masyarakat kita,\" sambungnya. Dia menyebut keanggotaan di OECD akan memberikan manfaat yang konkret bagi Indonesia, khususnya untuk keluar dari negara pendapatan menengah atau middle income trap. Dengan begitu, Indonesia bisa melompat menjadi negara maju. \"OECD akan memberikan manfaat yang konkret bagi kita terutama agar kita tak terjebak ke dalam middle income trap dan kita bisa melompat menjadi negara maju karena memang di sana aturan mainnya banyak sekali yang harus kita ikuti,\" tutur dia. \"Dan ini akan mendisiplinkan kita untuk bisa masuk ke tujuan kita untuk menjadi negara maju,\" imbuh Jokowi.",

        "content": "The last days of May are flitting away, with (one hopes) a glorious summer ahead. A new season is an excellent opportunity to reflect on all that has been, all that is, and what you hope the time to come will bring. And what better companion for such reflecting than a charming new book? Below, you’ll find nineteen new ones to consider, including stories from the acclaimed poet Sally Wen Mao; an apparently sexy and soulful queer roadtrip of a novel from Emma Copley Eisenberg; a collection of essays from the brilliant-yet-little-known Chilean writer Pedro Lemebel; a look at the wide influence of Judith Jones; a blend of memoir and critique by Michael Andor Brodeur that explores muscle culture, gender, and, yes, the complications of swole-ness; Michael Bérubé on sci-fi; wide-roving poems from John Balaban; and more. I hope you’ll find much to delight in, mull, and marvel at below. Let those to-be-read piles grow! * “From acclaimed poet Sally Wen Mao comes her first collection of short stories , a fabulist retelling of the nine-tailed fo x spirit of Asian folklore. From a fox spirit avenging a teen girl by seducing her abuser to an assassination plot against the Queen of Korea known as Operation Fox Hunt, each story glimmers with captivating premises and glistens with undeniable lyricism. Sally Wen Mao has built entire worlds in each short entry, making this a prose debut that you don’t want to miss.” – “The brilliant, queer, abundant, art-drunk, soulful, sexy American road-trip novel we’ve needed for so long.” –Stacey D’Erasmo “A beautifully realized book, nearly perfect, as van der Wouden quietly explores the intricate nuances of resentment-hued sibling dynamics, the discovery of desire (and the simultaneous discovery of self), queer relationships at a time when they went unspoken, and the legacy of war and what it might mean to have been complicit in its horrors....A brilliant debut, as multifaceted as a gem.” – “ cements [Lemebel’s] place in the canon—the literary one, the queer one, the Chilean one, the Latin American one, the human one. This collection of devastatingly gay and unabashedly political essays is, in fact, a quiver of exquisite arrows...electrifying and gorgeously written...brilliantly translated by Gwendolyn Harper....Lemebel spills anti-fascist tea in dizzying prose that spins us ever closer to the collective liberation he was seeking.” –Alejandro Varela “In a follow-up to his award-winning debut memoir, (2020), Álvarez embarks on another journey of self-discovery....A lasting theme of the book is that amid life’s disappointments, music offers a healing balm, as do the people who show unflinching generosity. Once again, this gifted writer proves to be an essential contemporary voice.” – “Through her editorial work, Judith Jones changed the perception of what it meant to be a woman who cooks. Through , Sara B. Franklin gives shape and weight to a career that could have continued on as a footnote; in doing so, she proves Jones was too good and influential to live on like that.” –Alicia Kennedy “In a way that few poets do, John Balaban truly roams the globe—and the centuries. He has his eye on empires, yes, but also on moments when different slices of history collide....His capacious poems enlarge our eyes on the world.” –Adam Hochschild “ is a lean, careening thrill of a book....Conor O’Toole’s steady embroilment with the wealthy people he teaches tennis to is drawn with exquisite dread. Wayne has a genius for brief observations that reveal whole reams of truth about class, poverty and competition, while also never allowing the hideously compelling story to let up for a moment. Exhilarating, cutting, and funny, is already one of my favorite books of the year.” –Megan Nolan “Reading Garth Risk Hallberg is a constant delightful surprise–you never know what’s coming next: a gorgeous turn of phrase, a perfect pop culture reference, a brilliant new observation, a jaw-dropping plot twist. And all of these gifts are on full display in a story about a father bound up by his mistakes, a daughter bound up in her silence, and a family in need of saving. It’s a beautiful and daring novel, as inventive as it is breathtaking.” –Nathan Hill “Grimaldi is a best-selling author in France, and her bittersweet English-language debut is sure to tug at the heartstrings of readers who appreciate moving novels which explore the complexities of sisterly love and mental illness, such as by Miriam Toews (2014), or by Mira T. Lee (2018).” – “Erudite, insightful and hugely enjoyable, features an eclectic cast of oddballs, eccentrics and visionaries who have shaped the printed book. A fabulous, first-class read.” –Giles Milton “A timely, unprecedented survey of an unexpected, often overlooked figure in body politics: the meathead....Necessary....Crucial....For anyone engaged in the Sisyphean pursuit of muscle and bulk–and to anyone interested in engaging with a critical examination of masculinity– is an invitation to broaden our view on what it means to want to get big.” –Colin Self “Are human beings worth saving? Viewing that question through the lens of science fiction, is one of those rare and wonderful books that will engage aficionados and general readers together. Bérubé writes with conviction, clarity, and warmth–this is literary and cinematic analysis of the highest order, presented in a personal voice that always keeps you in the story.” –Leonard Cassuto “Oftentimes, feels like a lustrous alternative to the doomscroll. Non-narrative vignettes—which all utilize an ‘I’ that assumes different lives and situations in each ‘story’—are transitioned between with short lines that read both like brilliant tweets (‘We don’t have to ride or die we can just chill’) and like aphorisms....A handful of the vignettes tell stories of outcasts....These are some of the moments in which beautifully narrates the experience of being queer...dazzling.” – “Rochelle Gurstein’s sensitive reconsideration of what we mean by a classic is a deeply personal and broadly relevant reflection on what we want from the concept when we wield it. This compellingly written study should be of interest to anyone who cares about beauty, the history of admiration, or about how cultural values change over time. It is bound to make an impact.” –Jonah Siegel “A significant follow-up to Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English’s seminal , offers a nuanced view into pre-modern spirituality....Deeply researched, is rich with primary source accounts that elucidate how service magic was used to treat the ills of everyday life in pre-modern and medieval Europe...a welcome addition to any history-buff’s bookshelf....Connecting past to present, Stanmore proves that magic-seeking is deeply human.” –Frances F. Denny “The traces the struggle to control the trans-Appalachian west, as European empires and later the American Republic fought to wrest control of this region from its Indigenous inhabitants. Chronicling the violence and chaos that defined this contest over the ‘back country, ‘ Robert Parkinson provides a bold new interpretation of the founding history of the United States.” –Michael Jay Witgen “A vibrant history both of the astonishingly successful Federal Theatre Project and the culture wars that succeeded in quashing it....Its demise still resonates, Shapiro warns, with the Dies playbook revived by culture warriors noisily censoring the arts. Sharp history as cautionary tale.” – “Anne Kim’s book is a tour de force, showing in painstaking detail the myriad ways that corporations—many of them ostensibly with a mission to tackle poverty and to manage state and federal antipoverty efforts—exploit America’s poor. Read this book and weep, and then demand action from legislators to end the systemic incentives for legalized highway robbery against individuals and families already living on—or in many cases beyond—the economic margins.” –Sasha Abramsky",

        "content": "Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday acquitted Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and four others in the 2002 murder case of a former Dera official. The Special CBI court of Panchkula had sentenced all the accused including Gurmeet Ram Rahim of Dera Sacha Sauda and four others to life imprisonment in the murder case of Dera manager Ranjit Singh. A fine of Rs 31 lakh was also imposed on Ram Rahim and Rs 50,000 on the remaining accused. A division bench of Justice Sureshwar Thakur and Justice Lalit Batra changed the lower court order and acquitted all the five accused today. Jatinder Khurana, lawyer of Gurmeet Ram Rahim, said, “The Honorable Punjab and Haryana High Court has changed the order of the lower court and all five people who were involved in this have been acquitted. We welcome this decision.” Ram Rahim, who is also serving a 20-year jail term for raping two of his disciples, is currently lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak, Haryana. It was alleged that Ranjit Singh, a resident of village Khanpur Kolian, Kurukshetra was murdered on July 10, 2002, when he was working in his fields at village Khanpur Kolian of District Kurukshetra in Haryana. After a thorough investigation, CBI filed a charge sheet in 2007 against six accused and charges were framed in 2008 while, on October 8, 2021, the court convicted Rahim and four others in connection with former Dera manager Ranjit Singh’s murder case.",

Die Jungbauernschaft/Landjugend Bezirk Lienz hat sich in diesem Jahr einem besonders bedeutungsvollen Projekt verschrieben: Zwischen dem 10. und 19. Mai wurden Zeitkapseln in den jeweiligen Gemeinden vergraben. Bis zum Jahr 2050 bleiben diese Kapseln unter der Erde und bewahren die Botschaften für die kommenden Generationen. ﻿Eine besondere Aktion Unter dem Motto \"Zeitkapsel - Verbindung zwischen Tradition und Zukunft\" haben sich mehrere Ortsgruppen des Bezirks (Abfaltersbach, Ainet, Anras, Außervillgraten, Gaimberg, Innervillgraten, Iselsberg-Stronach, Kals, Kartitsch, Lavant, Nußdorf-Debant, Panzendorf, Schlaiten, Sillian, St. Johann, St. Veit, Strassen, Tessenberg, Thurn, Patriasdorf) zusammengeschlossen, um eine Zeitkapselaktion durchzuführen. Dieses Projekt stärkt nicht nur die Gemeinschaft der Mitglieder und Gruppen untereinander, sondern spiegelt auch die persönlichen Geschichten und Wünsche jedes einzelnen wider. Die Idee hinter dem Projekt Jede Ortsgruppe hat ihre eigene Zeitkapsel entworfen, gemeinsam gebaut und mit persönlichen Gegenständen, Erinnerungen und aktuellen Dingen gefüllt. Von Handwerkzeugen über Fotos, persönliche Briefe bis hin zu symbolträchtigen Gegenständen aus dem Alltag – die Zeitkapseln sind ein lebendiges Zeugnis der Kultur und Identität der jeweiligen Gemeinden. „Unser Ziel mit diesem Projekt ist es nicht nur, eine Brücke zwischen Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft zu schlagen, sondern auch die Gemeinschaft untereinander zu stärken, indem man etwas erschafft, was nicht nur für uns ist, sondern für unsere Kinder und Enkelkinder. Wir möchten nicht nur unsere großartigen Traditionen bewahren, sondern auch den Blick nach vorne richten und den kommenden Generationen eine Botschaft hinterlassen”, erklärt Maximilian Jans, Obmann der JB/LJ Bezirk Lienz.

        "description": "AI tools significantly aid informal caregivers, enhancing efficiency and well-being. Research included 10 studies globally, primarily using machine learning techniques. Accuracy metrics ranged from 71.60% to 99.33%, indicating high reliability.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by providing crucial support to informal caregivers, who are essential yet often overlooked in the healthcare system. With an aging population and increasing reliance on these caregivers, innovative solutions are needed. This study explores how AI tools are not only enhancing caregiving efficiency but also improving the well-being of caregivers. The research employed a comprehensive approach, involving multiple databases and stringent inclusion criteria, to provide a thorough understanding of AI’s potential in this domain. Researchers conducted an extensive search across Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, focusing on AI applications that aid informal caregivers. They adhered to PRISMA 2020 guidelines, ensuring a rigorous selection process. From an initial pool of 947 articles, only 10 met the criteria, emphasizing AI’s role in supporting caregivers rather than just data collection. The selected studies, conducted between 2012 and 2023, were globally distributed, highlighting a widespread interest in this research area. Notably, 80% of these studies utilized techniques. Validation methods varied, with Hold-Out being the most common, demonstrating the diverse approaches in the field. Accuracy metrics across these studies ranged from 71.60% to 99.33%, indicating the reliability and effectiveness of AI tools in caregiving contexts. Specific advanced methods like SCUT combined with neural networks (NNs) and LibSVM showcased impressive accuracy rates between 93.42% and 95.36%. The F-measures also spanned from 93.30% to 95.41%, further emphasizing the high performance of these methods. However, AUC values varied significantly, ranging from 0.50 to 0.85 in certain models, suggesting room for improvement in some areas. The findings underscore AI’s significant role in aiding informal caregivers, offering smart and adaptive support systems. These tools not only enhance caregiving effectiveness but also contribute to the caregivers’ well-being by reducing their burden. The research highlights the potential of AI to address the challenges faced by informal caregivers, which is crucial given the growing aging population. Previously, studies have also shown AI’s potential in healthcare, but they often focused on patient outcomes rather than caregiver support. This study shifts the focus to the caregivers, providing a new perspective on AI’s applications. Compared to earlier research, this study offers a more comprehensive view by including a wide range of AI methodologies and validation techniques, making it a significant contribution to the field. AI’s integration into caregiving is not without challenges, such as the need for personalized solutions and ethical considerations. However, it holds immense potential for transforming care practices. By leveraging AI, caregivers can manage their responsibilities more effectively, leading to better outcomes for both caregivers and care recipients. Future research should continue to explore diverse AI applications, focusing on personalized and ethical solutions that address the unique needs of caregivers.

        "description": "Le régulateur britannique, l'Ofcom, vient de lancer une consultation sur un nouveau code visant à protéger les mineurs des contenus illégaux en ligne. Détaillé sur plus de 1.000 pages, ce cadre réglementaire s'annonce plus strict que dans l'UE.",
        "content": "En matière de protection des mineurs en ligne, et particulièrement sur les réseaux sociaux, A rebours de l'idée reçue, selon laquelle le Brexit allait se traduire par une dérégulation Outre-Manche, le pays a profité de sa nouvelle liberté réglementaire pour resserrer l'étau sur les réseaux sociaux. L'Ofcom, le régulateur britannique, vient de lancer une consultation qui confirme cette volonté britannique d'aller plus loin que le cadre européen, même si, sur le continent, la Commission européenne commence à sévir. Mi-mai, (propriété de Meta) pour violation présumée de leurs obligations de protection des mineurs. Détaillé sur plus de 1.000 pages, le cadre réglementaire proposé par l'Ofcom détaille les obligations auxquelles devront se soumettre les plateformes sous peine de lourdes amendes, allant jusqu'à 10 % du chiffre d'affaires mondial, ou de sanctions pénales à l'encontre des dirigeants. Ce code découle de la nouvelle loi sur la sécurité en ligne (« Online safety bill ») adoptée en octobre 2023 par le Parlement britannique après plus de dix-huit mois de débat, et qui vise à faire du Royaume-Uni, selon les termes employés par le gouvernement, « l'endroit le plus sûr en ligne ». « Cette loi va véritablement constituer une divergence avec l'UE, avec un cadre qui sera plus contraignant au Royaume-Uni », observe Monica Horten, conseillère indépendante en matière de régulation et de technologie, notamment auprès du Conseil de l'Europe. Principale différence : le règlement européen DSA, qui impose des obligations aux plateformes en matière de contenus, s'appuie sur la législation européenne existante, plus précisément celle mise en place pour l'e-commerce dans les années 2000. La loi britannique fait table rase de cet héritage législatif européen. Conséquence, les plateformes devront filtrer de manière systématique les contenus illégaux, alors que sur le continent, ce sera aux utilisateurs de les signaler. Ces contenus devront ensuite être retirés par les plateformes. « Ce n'était pas possible dans le droit européen de mettre en place cette surveillance systématique pour des questions de liberté d'expression », explique Monica Horten. L'autre divergence tient à la définition de ce qu'est un contenu illégal. « Dans le texte européen, trois catégories sont visées : terrorisme, abus sexuels et les propos haineux. Au Royaume-Uni, les plateformes devront cibler tous types de messages ayant trait au trafic de drogues, d'être humains, au suicide, à l'automutilation, à la pornographie extrême, aux ventes d'armes, etc. », précise-t-elle. Ce tour de vis britannique intervient dans un contexte hautement passionnel. Le pays a été secoué l'an dernier par le meurtre d'une adolescente transgenre, Brianna Ghey, dont les assassins ont reconnu lors de leur procès avoir visionné des vidéos d'une extrême violence sur le « dark web ». Dans un autre cas emblématique, celui du suicide de Molly Russell à l'âge de 14 ans, la responsabilité des réseaux sociaux a été clairement établie. Les parents de ces victimes ont porté le débat public sur la protection des mineurs en ligne et l'interdiction du smartphone avant l'âge de 16 ans. Le code de l'Ofcom impose plus de 40 mesures pratiques que les plateformes vont devoir mettre en place, parmi lesquelles la mise en place d'un filtre dans l'algorithme pour bloquer les contenus inadaptés et des systèmes de vérification d'âge « hautement efficaces ». Qu'il s'agisse de reconnaissance faciale ou d'identité numérique, l'efficacité de ces procédures fait toutefois débat. L'Ofcom a récemment fait un exemple, en ouvrant une enquête contre le site OnlyFans, utilisé par les travailleurs du sexe, dont les systèmes de vérification ont été pointés comme insuffisants. Ce code, soumis à consultation jusqu'en juillet, doit être mis au point d'ici un an. Les plateformes auront ensuite trois mois pour se conformer aux obligations.

Numerous things that went viral online include the Dolce & Gabbana \"Khaki Ski Mask Cap\" for Rs 32,000 or the Hugo Boss flip-flops offered for Rs 9,000. Now, French brand Louis Vuitton recently unveiled its new women's collections in the Cruise 2025 show. However, a pair of boots has caught the internet's attention. The boots' top features a brown-coloured structural pattern with straps, while the bottom has black fringes that give them a brush-like appearance. The description of the boots on the company's website said, \"From sharp tailoring to flamboyant silhouettes enlivened with graphic chiaroscuro, Nicolas Ghesquiere imbues his signature style with a passionate Spanish flair, cultivating a multifaceted allure through an emotional journey of discovery.\" A post shared by Louis Vuitton (@louisvuitton) The fringe boots, which are a part of Ghesquiere's recent Cruise 2025 Collection, have generated a lot of discussion on social media. \"Louis, I love you... really, I do but these shoes omgggg. they remind me of an ostrich for some reason,\" said a user.

        "content": "„House of the Dragon“: Im Sommer 2024 geht die Serie mit der zweiten Staffel an den Start. Quelle: HBO/Sky Deutschland/obs Ab Juni fliegen sie wieder: „House of the Dragon“ kehrt mit Staffel zwei zurück. Wann es losgeht und worum es geht, erfahren Sie hier. Inklusive Übersicht aller wichtigen Charaktere und Drachen. Westeros steht am Abgrund eines verheerenden Drachenkriegs. Wer hat Anspruch auf den Eisernen Thron und für welche Seite der Familie Targaryen werden sich die Häuser entscheiden? Am 17. Juni geht es los, das Prequel von Game of Thrones startet in die nächste Runde. HBO hat am 15. Mai einen weiteren Trailer veröffentlicht, in dem reichlich Drachen-Action geboten wird. Im Sommer 2024 kehrt das „Game of Thrones“-Spinoff mit der zweiten Staffel zurück. Die gefeierte erste Staffel lief sowohl auf dem Streamingdienst Wow (und ist dort weiterhin verfügbar) als auch im Free-TV. Sky hat bereits bekanntgegeben, wann das Abenteuer in Westeros weitergeht: Die zweite Staffel von „House of the Dragon“ feiert am 17. Juni 2024 Premiere . Die zweite Staffel wird sowohl im Original als auch in der deutschen Synchronfassung verfügbar sein (deutsche und englische Untertitel ebenfalls verfügbar). „House of the Dragon“ wird nicht am Stück veröffentlicht, statt Serienbingen heißt es also Woche für Woche auf eine neue Folge warten. Die Folgen sind jeweils ab dem frühen Morgen verfügbar, insgesamt wird Staffel zwei acht Episoden umfassen. Das sind die Sendetermine: „Schwarz“ für Königin Rhaenyra oder „Grün“ für König Aegon? Beide Seiten erheben in Staffel zwei Anspruch auf den Thron. Erste Einblicke in die neue Staffel geben die folgenden Trailer. Wie schon „Game of Thrones“, ist auch „House of the Dragon“ mit einer Vielzahl von Charakteren gespickt. Ein Überblick der wichtigsten Personen des Hauses Targaryen und darüber hinaus: Personen des Hauses Targaryen Sonstige wichtige Charaktere aus „House of the Dragon“ Mehr zum Thema Anders als in „Game of Thrones“ kommen Drachenfans schon in Staffel eins von „House of the Dragon“ voll auf ihre Kosten. Sie verteilen sich insbesondere auf die beiden Fraktionen „Die Grünen“ und „Die Schwarzen“, außerdem gibt es noch einige wilde Drachen. Die Geschichte von „House of the Dragon“ spielt 200 Jahre vor den Ereignissen von „Game of Thrones“ und beleuchtet den Aufstieg und Fall des Hauses Targaryen. Im Zentrum steht König Viserys I. Targaryen, der über Westeros mit seinen Drachen herrscht. Sein größtes Problem: Er hat keinen männlichen Erben. Um die Nachfolge zu regeln, bricht er mit der Tradition und ernennt seine Tochter Rhaenyra zur Erbin. Diese Entscheidung spaltet das Königreich, da viele der Ansicht sind, dass ein männlicher Verwandter den Thron besteigen sollte. Die Spannungen gipfeln in einem brutalen Bürgerkrieg, bekannt als „Tanz der Drachen“, in dem verschiedene Fraktionen innerhalb der Familie Targaryen um die Herrschaft über Westeros kämpfen. Dieser Konflikt schwächt das Haus Targaryen nachhaltig und ebnet den Weg für seinen späteren Untergang.",

        "description": "Russia's unmatched capabilities in electronic warfare have previously been cited by Western experts as one of the key factors contributing to the failure of the Ukrainian counteroffensive last summer.",
        "content": "\"Russia has the most capable electronic warfare systems in the world with the longest range and most powerful GPS and radio frequency jammers of any nation,\" David T. Pyne , an EMP task force scholar and former US Department of Defense officer, told Sputnik. Pyne said he had been impressed by \"the speed at which Russian long-range jammers have been able to adapt to jamming new US and NATO weapon systems that have been introduced into the [Ukraine] conflict.\" Russian EW systems \"have proven effective at causing 90% of guided missile and drone systems supplied by the US to Ukraine to miss their target, most importantly HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System],\" according to the ex-Pentagon officer. He suggested that Russian GPS jammers \"will likely prove increasingly effective against the recently supplied extended range US ATACMS [Army Tactical Missile System] missiles as well.\" Additionally, Russian jamming systems \"are likely proving increasingly effective against US supplied Ukrainian air defense systems including Patriot and Hawk [interceptor] missiles enabling Russia to increase its air superiority over Ukraine,\" - something that is contributing significantly to the ongoing offensive by Russian troops in several areas of the front line, Pyne stressed. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:409:3077:1639_640x0_80_0_0_47e6002882f8e73e682c79627544e398.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_640x0_80_0_0_0776f3f070380f8ddacaeb6fedd41372.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_640x0_80_0_0_0776f3f070380f8ddacaeb6fedd41372.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_640x0_80_0_0_7b60d1771e1d6ccc75132d598b71c74c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_640x0_80_0_0_7b60d1771e1d6ccc75132d598b71c74c.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_640x0_80_0_0_bd87f454223985c4fde00723bedd27f6.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_640x0_80_0_0_bd87f454223985c4fde00723bedd27f6.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:409:3077:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_c8d6acb351ba37008fc4dec3597b981f.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_1280x0_80_0_0_cb7b52c16216ac9bf44d7d4bf1b02f30.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_1280x0_80_0_0_cb7b52c16216ac9bf44d7d4bf1b02f30.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_9cda9762562204f7d02ba146dfa872d8.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_9cda9762562204f7d02ba146dfa872d8.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_fa4b8675c1231aa8b348deb7f1272a24.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_fa4b8675c1231aa8b348deb7f1272a24.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:409:3077:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_51c64b9cb99f1e927da83303f3cb098b.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_1920x0_80_0_0_ac0f576a3c167c4cb3f9ee4989a578a8.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_0:159:3077:1889_1920x0_80_0_0_ac0f576a3c167c4cb3f9ee4989a578a8.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_b5be45e1e969403a54235fe9714165b5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_173:0:2902:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_b5be45e1e969403a54235fe9714165b5.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_89b87c47418832c3e511ac0a7673a7c2.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/1c/1118659560_514:0:2561:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_89b87c47418832c3e511ac0a7673a7c2.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Russia Second to None: How Russia Masters Its Electronic Warfare 15 April, 19:12 GMT Earlier this month, the Washington Post, citing Ukrainian commanders and a Ukrainian military research project, reported that the Russian army's jamming systems had disrupted the accuracy of some of Ukraine's US-supplied precision-guided weapons, prompting Ukrainian forces to stop using them on the battlefield. The US and its NATO allies stepped up arms deliveries to the Kiev regime shortly after the Russian special military operation began. Moscow has repeatedly warned that such deliveries would only exacerbate the conflict in Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, for his part, said that any cargo containing weapons for Ukraine would become a legitimate target for Russian forces.",

Forventningene har aldri vært målt høyere. – Det er lite som tyder på at husholdningene er skremt av den siste rentebeskjeden til Norges Bank. Sentralbankens vurdering om at styringsrenten har nådd toppen, synes å være utslagsgivende, sier sjeføkonom Hilde Midsem i Norske Boligbyggelags Landsforbund (NBBL). I mai ventet 69 prosent av husholdningene at boligprisene skal videre opp, mens bare 5 prosent trodde på boligprisfall. Boligprisforventningene har tatt seg opp måned for måned hittil i år. – I år ligger det an til at de fleste vil få reallønnsvekst, og samtidig er arbeidsledigheten fortsatt lav. Samlet peker dette mot at boligprisene vil øke moderat de neste månedene, mener Midsem. Undersøkelsen ble gjennomført etter Norges Banks rentebeslutning tidligere i mai, der det ble varslet at første kutt trolig skyves ut i tid.",

        "content": "El PP ha reaccionado al reconocimiento por parte del Gobierno español del Estado palestino acusando al presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, de desatender las necesidades de los españoles y centrarse en Palestina para no hablar de la amnistía y \"la corrupción de su partido\". \"Sánchez está cómodo hablando de Palestina (o de Argentina) para no hablar del Estado español a 48 horas de aprobar la Ley de Amnistía y con la corrupción de su partido, su Gobierno y su entorno siendo investigado en la Audiencia Nacional pero también por las instituciones de Justicia de la Unión Europea\", han expresado fuentes 'populares'. En opinión de los de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, Sánchez \"centra sus esfuerzos\" en Oriente Medio \"para arrebatar el voto de sus socios o exsocios parlamentarios\", mientras las necesidades de los españoles \"siguen sin merecer su atención\" en asuntos como la inflación, el precio de la vivienda, la subida de los alquileres, así como la inseguridad ciudadana, la sequía o la crisis en el sector agroganadero. El PP también ha deseado que \"nadie haya madrugado mucho\" para escuchar el discurso del presidente del Gobierno español de esta mañana ante el reconocimiento de Palestina como Estado: \"No ha dicho nada que no hubiera podido comunicar su portavoz en la rueda de prensa ordinaria del Consejo de Ministros. Las escasas novedades debió darlas en su comparecencia del Congreso de la pasada semana solicitada por él mismo\". En este sentido, los 'populares' han recalcado que lo dicho hoy por Sánchez no solo no cuenta con el apoyo de otros países de nuestro entorno, sino que no cuenta \"ni con el de la mitad de su Gobierno\", ya que la vicepresidenta segunda Yolanda Díaz \"fijó unas fronteras totalmente diferentes de las que dice defender Sánchez para ese nuevo estado Palestino\". Las declaraciones del PP tienen lugar después de que Sánchez haya anunciado formalmente el reconocimiento del Estado palestino, que aprobará el Consejo de Ministros este martes, y ha dejado claro que esta \"decisión histórica\" no va en contra de Israel, un \"pueblo amigo\" , sino que lo que refleja es el \"rechazo a Hamás\".",

        "content": "Asahi Kasei has offered to buy Sweden’s Calliditas Therapeutics for SEK 11.8 billion ($1.1 billion) as part of a plan to expand internationally in healthcare. The Japanese group’s tender offer is a premium of around 83% on Calliditas’ closing share price yesterday and has been recommended by the biotech’s board, which says a takeover would enhance its ability to develop and commercialise its products. Calliditas specialises in developing drugs for rare diseases and has one product on the market – corticosteroid-based Tarpeyo (budesonide) for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) which is also sold as Nefecon in China and Kinpeygo in Europe – and a pipeline headed by dual NADPH oxidase (NOX4/1) inhibitor setanaxib. The Swedish company is projecting sales of Tarpeyo will reach around $150 million this year, but Asahi Kasei’s interest will also likely be driven by the potential of setanaxib, which has been described as a “pipeline-in-a-product” and has the potential to be first-in-class. The drug is being developed for a range of fibrotic rare diseases and solid tumours, with three phase 2 readouts expected this year in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Asahi Kasei is a diversified industrial group – with fingers in a lot of pies including chemicals, construction, and energy – but in recent years has made expansion in the pharma and medical device sectors a priority, for example buying critical care products developer Zoll in 2012 and transplant care specialist Veloxis in 2020. Last year, healthcare accounted for 20% of net sales and around a third of operating profit. The company said in a statement that buying Calliditas ties in with its strategy to “expand its businesses globally through specialising in the areas of immunology, transplantation, and adjacent diseases.” Tarpeyo fits squarely into its current areas of expertise in health and has potential as the only fully approved product shown to reduce the loss of kidney function in adults with primary IgAN who are at risk for disease progression, it added. Calliditas was recently awarded seven years of market exclusivity for the drug, giving it protection from generic competition until 2030. Other benefits of the takeover will include a stronger presence in the US market through expanded in-house sales in the renal and autoimmune disease categories. It will also give it a presence in Europe – initially in R&D – and contribute to the company’s plan to build a global specialty pharma business.",

        "description": "Alasan pembatalan UKT jadi kabar gembira untuk mahasiswa baru.",
        "content": "Uang Kuliah Tunggal ( ) merupakan biaya yang dikenakan kepada setiap mahasiswa, untuk mendukung proses pembelajaran mereka di perguruan tinggi. Namun, dengan besaran yang melambung tinggi memicu gelombang protes dari berbagai pihak seperti mahasiswa, calon mahasiswa baru, masyarakat, hingga Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR). Setelah berbagai protes yang dilayangkan, Menteri Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi (Mendikbudristek) menyampaikan alasan pembatalan UKT di Istana Merdeka, Jakarta, pada Senin kemarin, 27 Mei 2024 setalah bertemu Presiden Joko Widodo. Nadiem Makarim mengumumkan bahwa alasan oleh pemerintah dilakukan dalam rangka mengevaluasi kembali permintaan peningkatan UKT yang diajukan oleh perguruan tinggi negeri. Tentu saja pengumuman ini menjadi sumber kegembiraan bagi sivitas akademika, khususnya mahasiswa baru tahun 2024. Advertisement Meskipun keputusan ini disambut baik oleh sebagian besar pihak, namun belum sepenuhnya memberikan kedamaian dalam dunia pendidikan tinggi. Hal ini disebabkan oleh masih adanya berbagai aturan terkait Perguruan Tinggi Negeri Berbadan Hukum (PTN BH) yang belum dicabut, di mana berpotensi memunculkan polemik baru. Berikut ini alasan pembatalan UKT oleh Mendikbudristek yang Liputan6.com rangkum dari berbagai sumber, Selasa (28/5/2024). Uang Kuliah Tunggal (UKT) adalah sistem pembayaran yang diterapkan di seluruh Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (PTN) di Indonesia. Sistem ini memungkinkan setiap mahasiswa dan mahasiswi membayar biaya kuliah setiap semester, yang telah disubsidi oleh pemerintah. Pengaturan UKT telah diatur dalam Peraturan Menteri Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Republik Indonesia Nomor 55 Tahun 2013 pasal 1 ayat 3, di mana setiap mahasiswa hanya membayar komponen UKT. Proses penentuan UKT dilakukan berdasarkan penghasilan orang tua. Sebelum memasuki perkuliahan, calon mahasiswa diminta untuk mengisi formulir yang menentukan nilai UKT mereka. Nilai UKT dipertimbangkan dari pendapatan dan pengeluaran orang tua setiap bulannya, termasuk gaji, jumlah aset, dan biaya hidup. UKT berfungsi untuk memberikan subsidi silang berdasarkan kondisi ekonomi dan sosial orang tua atau wali tiap mahasiswa. Pengelompokan UKT didasarkan pada pendapatan orang tua mahasiswa. Semakin tinggi pendapatan orang tua, semakin tinggi UKT yang harus dibayar mahasiswa. Sebaliknya, semakin rendah pendapatan orang tua, semakin rendah pula UKT yang harus dibayarkan mahasiswa terkait. Tujuan dari sistem UKT ini adalah untuk membantu mahasiswa yang mengalami kesulitan ekonomi. Dengan adanya subsidi silang, diharapkan mahasiswa dari latar belakang ekonomi yang kurang mampu tetap dapat mengakses pendidikan tinggi tanpa terkendala oleh biaya kuliah yang tinggi. Menteri Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi (Mendikbudristek) Nadiem Makarim pada tanggal 27 Mei, mengumumkan pembatalan kenaikan Uang Kuliah Tunggal (UKT) untuk Tahun 2024. Keputusan ini disampaikan setelah pertemuan terbatas bersama Presiden RI Joko Widodo di Istana Kepresidenan. Kabar ini disambut dengan sukacita oleh sivitas akademika, terutama mahasiswa baru tahun 2024. Pasalnya akhir-akhir ini, perguruan tinggi di Indonesia melakukan penyesuaian terhadap biaya pendidikan, tidak hanya UKT, tetapi juga biaya uang pangkal. Mendikbudristek Nadiem Makarim juga menyatakan bahwa pembatalan kenaikan UKT Tahun 2024 dipicu oleh aspirasi yang diberikan oleh berbagai pihak kepada Kementerian Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi. Tidak hanya keluhan dari mahasiswa yang terkejut dengan pengumuman mendadak kenaikan biaya kuliah di kampus mereka, tetapi juga aspirasi dari keluarga dan masyarakat yang merasa khawatir. ujar Nadiem saat berbicara dengan media di Istana Kepresidenan, Jakarta pada Senin (27/05). Menteri Pendidikan ini kemudian menegaskan, bahwa dengan pembatalan kenaikan UKT tersebut baik mahasiswa baru maupun mahasiswa yang sedang menjalani studi tidak akan terpengaruh oleh kenaikan biaya kuliah. ungkap Mendikbudristek Nadiem Makarim. Menurut Peraturan Menteri Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Nomor 25 Tahun 2020, penentuan besarnya Uang Kuliah Tunggal (UKT) hanya berlaku bagi mahasiswa yang diterima melalui jalur Seleksi Nasional Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (SNMPTN) dan Seleksi Bersama Masuk Perguruan Tinggi Negeri (SBMPTN). Namun, mahasiswa yang masuk ke perguruan tinggi negeri melalui jalur mandiri, akan dikenakan biaya kuliah yang telah ditetapkan oleh pihak kampus. Salah satu faktor utama dalam menentukan besarnya UKT adalah pendapatan orang tua atau wali. Berikut adalah langkah-langkah umum dalam penentuan besar kecilnya UKT: 1. Mahasiswa yang diterima melalui jalur SNMPTN atau SBMPTN di kampus terpilih akan diminta untuk mengisi formulir yang disediakan oleh universitas. Formulir ini berisi informasi seputar pendapatan orang tua. 2. Selain pendapatan orang tua, mahasiswa juga diharuskan memberikan informasi tentang luas tanah rumah, jumlah kendaraan, jumlah rumah, dan pengeluaran bulanan keluarga.Kadang-kadang, mahasiswa juga diminta untuk mengunggah foto bagian depan rumah mereka. 3. Setelah mengisi formulir tersebut, pihak universitas akan menetapkan besaran UKT per semester berdasarkan informasi yang tercantum di dalam formulir. Untuk memberikan gambaran lebih jelas tentang penggolongan UKT, berikut adalah contoh penetapan UKT di Universitas Gadjah Mada (UGM) dengan pendapatan orang tua sebagai kriteria utamanya: - UKT 0: Peserta Bidikmisi (program bantuan pendidikan dari pemerintah) - UKT 1: Pendapatan kurang dari Rp500.000 - UKT 2: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp500.000, kurang dari Rp2.000.000 - UKT 3: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp2.000.000, kurang dari Rp3.500.000 - UKT 4: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp3.500.000, kurang dari Rp5.000.000 - UKT 5: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp5.000.000, kurang dari Rp10.000.000 - UKT 6: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp10.00.000, kurang dari Rp20.000.000 - UKT 7: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp20.000.000, kurang dari Rp30.000.000 - UKT 8: Pendapatan lebih dari Rp30.000.000 Dengan penetapan UKT ini, diharapkan agar biaya pendidikan dapat disesuaikan dengan kemampuan ekonomi keluarga mahasiswa, sehingga tidak menjadi beban yang berat bagi mereka.",

        "description": "Hyatt is taking Japan’s traditional ryokan inns mainstream, introducing Western features including beds as well as futons; à la carte menu options; and private hot baths to go with communal ones.",
        "content": "It takes a particular kind of traveller to experience Japan’s most traditional hotel: the ryokan. Hyatt Hotels hopes to take the ryokan concept mainstream with Atona – a luxury boutique brand it is launching with Kyoto-based developer Kiraku. The first three locations, scheduled to start opening in 2026, include the well-trodden town of Hakone (two hours southwest of Tokyo by train), the hot springs valley area of Yufu, in southwestern Japan, and Yakushima – a remote and mountainous island near Okinawa. The starting nightly rates are likely to range from US$800 to around US$1,300. “We were very curious about how to create more opportunities for customers to engage with Japan,” David Udell, group president of Asia-Pacific for Hyatt, said ahead of the announcement of Atona’s first locations. Working with Kiraku helps the United States-based company fill the gaps in its knowledge base, especially with regard to development in rural areas and creating an authentic experience. Japanese-American Kiraku founder Kou Sundberg travelled across Japan to nail down Atona’s first three locations, finding building sites and getting local buy-in on the new projects. Now he is tasked with a tricky balancing act: figuring out how to create hotels that feel both modern and traditional, rooted in the unique facets of Japanese culture without intimidating the global consumer. So far, he has decided that guests will be able to choose between the typical futon floor mattresses or Western beds. And while high-end ryokans typically feature set, multi-course kaiseki meals served with a sake pairing, Atona properties will have dine-in restaurants with à la carte menus. The idea is that guests can order a hamburger and cocktail if the craving hits. Having amenities that cater to Western guests is a strategy that has worked for other ryokan operators, says Catherine Heald, co-founder and CEO of the Asia-focused travel specialist Remote Lands. “Most non-Japanese luxury travellers love a good kaiseki dinner, but only every three to four days – they definitely don’t want it every night,” she says. Many facets at Atona will adhere to tradition. Instead of a concierge, there will be a point person similar to an – the word means “landlady” but refers to the traditional female proprietor of a ryokan who oversees all guests’ needs. Although every room will have a private hot spring bath, there are plans to have larger communal hot springs at each property for guests who want the authentic experience. The initial details of Atona’s offerings suggest it is catering to curious, energetic travellers who are looking for experiences tied to well-being. (For one, the Yakushima location will be close to a protected national park filled with some of the oldest cedar trees in the world, and open for hiking.) It will especially suit the growing number of people who are returning to Japan, having already visited such cities as Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo. These seasoned travellers will be more likely to venture out towards more rural areas. “This larger ryokan set-up would be of much appeal to a segment of our clients,” says Tom Marchant, co-founder of the luxury travel outfit Black Tomato, which has a particular expertise in Japan. “There’s a strong desire for remote ryokan experiences in Japan, and if the product and experience pack a punch with a larger but very personal feel, it’s on the money,” he says, citing the success of brands such as Aman and Four Seasons across the country. With Atona’s proposition also come risks. Given their remote locations, small footprints and labour-intensive model, ryokans are notoriously hard businesses to scale and run. While Japan is experiencing a tourism boom now with the weak yen offering a bargain, there’s no guarantee that will last until 2026, when the first location is scheduled to open. Hyatt has recently added hundreds of luxury properties through mergers with brands such as Alila, Miraval and Mr. and Mrs. Smith. While the first three Atona locations will all be newly built, five additional locales may include renovation projects. If the brand catches on, there is the potential to take it outside Japan, to other areas with natural hot springs, in a style similar to the Japanese luxury brand Hoshinoya, which has locations in Bali and Taiwan. Sundberg says the latter, along with Northern California and Costa Rica, is in the potential expansion plans. “We really have to go see the destination and ... I think something has to kind of click in the head to proceed further,” he says.",

        "content": "Mick Schumacher could make a stunning return with Alpine at the Canadian Grand Prix. Schumacher, the son of seven-time world champion , has been out of an F1 seat since he was dropped by Haas F1 team in 2022 after two years of racing. The 25-year-old joined Mercedes as a reserve driver last year but has not had the chance to drive for the Silver Arrows. Away from F1, Schumacher signed up with the Alpine World Endurance Championship programme and will next month race at the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans. And his new affiliation with Alpine has sparked a potential return to F1 amid incredible tension with the camp, namely between both drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon.

On lap one of the Monaco Grand Prix last Sunday (May 26), Ocon attempted an audacious lunge down the inside of his team-mate, subsequently making contact and seeing the front wheel of Gasly’s car send his Alpine air bound, further straining an already fractious relationship. Following the race, Alpine team principal Bruno Famin told broadcasters there would be “consequences” for Ocon, which could see him step down for the upcoming Grand Prix at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve. The Frenchman could potentially be replaced by Alpine’s reserve driver Jack Doohan, or pave the way for a remarkable return for Schumacher. Speaking to , Famin revealed he’s been impressed by Schumacher’s adjustment to the challenges of the WEC, admitting it would be “a mistake” to not consider him for a seat next year, with both Gasly and Ocon out of contract at the end of the current season. He said: “I’m very happy with Mick. “He’s super fast, but that’s not the main thing. In the WEC, you have to drive at a consistently high level and have a good team spirit. I’m very impressed with him because he has adapted his attitude to endurance racing from day one. He gets on very well with his team-mates. “Everything is open for 2025, everyone is talking to everyone. It would be a mistake not to have Mick on the list.” Schumacher was present at Monaco, albeit on the sidelines, he said: “My goal and my dream is to drive in . That has always been the case and always will be. “That’s why we have to make sure that the dominoes now fall in my favour and that I hopefully end up with a seat. What I can do for that is simply give my best performance in the WEC and also in Formula 1 and continue to perform well for the team as reserve driver and continue to hold talks.”",

Many believe that basic income is an idealistic policy that is hard to implement in reality. At present, there is no country that has universal basic income entirely in place.Nevertheless, it has been partially implemented as a pilot program in Britain, Canada, Brazil and some parts of Europe over the past few decades. Boosted especially by the positive effects of the one-time payment of emergency funds given out in some 90 countries and regions in response to Covid-19, voices advocating basic income are growing.One example is the “Freedom Dividend” actively pushed by New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang in 2021. He made a radical proposal of giving $1,000 a month to all citizens to prepare for the possibility of one-third of American citizens losing jobs in the age of artificial intelligence.The concept of a universal basic income is generally known to be a product of the Age of Enlightenment. But a similar policy was implemented in ancient Rome. Julius Caesar, the father of autocratic politics, doled out 100 denarii in silver coins to all Roman citizens at a victory ceremony in 46 BC, and another 75 denarii was given out according to his will.Emperor Trajan is also known for various welfare policies.

        "content": "King Charles is set to plant the first seedling successfully grown from the illegally felled Sycamore Gap tree in Windsor. The iconic tree was felled in September 2023 in “an act of vandalism”, prompting the National Trust to take action to preserve this piece of English history by cultivating its seeds. The first successfully grown seedling was showcased at the Chelsea Flower Show last week before being gifted to the Monarch, 75, who is well known for his love of the natural world. He was gifted the sapling yesterday (27 May) on what is known as Celebration Day – the last bank holiday of the month – and the Trust announced that it will be planted in Windsor Great Park once it has matured into a sapling. A sapling is a young tree, and it is hoped that the recultivation of the iconic tree, which was a famous spot for stargazing and marriage proposals and even appeared in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves , will act as a symbol of hope for the future. The seedling is one of 100 seeds and 40 cuttings taken from the 200-year-old felled sycamore. It was cultivated at the National Trust’s Plant Conservation Centre alongside the other remnants of the felled Sycamore Gap Tree, which stood next to Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland. Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, said: “It is wonderful news that His Majesty will one day have the very first sapling grown from this iconic tree. The new tree will be seen by many thousands each year and will be the first of many Sycamore Gap saplings planted at different places, in Northumberland and beyond. “The swell of emotion we saw after the sycamore was felled goes to show how personally connected we all are to our natural heritage. These new green shoots are keeping the story of the Sycamore Gap alive, and are serving as a reminder of the simple and much-needed hope, joy and respite that nature can bring.” The exact planting locations of future seedlings is set to be announced later this year. Andy Jasper, the director of gardens and parklands at the National Trust, said a new Sycamore Gap tree could be replanted in the original location if the stump does not regrow. The felling of the tree on 28 September caused widespread outrage and saw two men arrested last October. Daniel Graham, 38, and Adam Carruthers, 31, from Cumbira, were subsequently charged with criminal damage to the tree and Hardian’s Wall last month. According to court documents, the criminal damage to the tree and wall came at an estimated cost of more than £620,000. In a court appearance earlier this month, Graham pled not guilty to felling the tree while Carruthers entered no plea. The case is ongoing.",

The University of Toronto is asking the courts to authorize police action to remove protesters who refuse orders to leave a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on campus earlier this month. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young Here is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to bring you up to speed on what you need to know today... U of T seeks court injunction to clear encampment as protesters stay put The University of Toronto is asking the courts to authorize police action to remove protesters who refuse orders to leave a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on campus earlier this month. The university has filed a notice of motion in court aimed at bringing about an end to the demonstration while saying the encampment was causing irreparable harm to the institution. The protesters have said they are prepared to fight back with their own legal team and refused to leave the site, ignoring a Monday morning deadline set in a trespass notice issued last week. Ontario legislator to make history at Queen's Park with speech, questions in Oji-Cree A First Nation legislator in Ontario is set to make history today when he rises at Queen's Park to speak in his language, Oji-Cree. For the first time in its history, the Ontario legislature will allow, interpret and transcribe a language other than English and French. New Democrat Sol Mamakwa sparked the change after convincing Government House Leader Paul Calandra to allow him to speak in the language his parents taught him. The legislature has brought in interpreters who will translate Mamakwa's words in real-time to English, which will then be translated into French. Red Lobster in Ontario court about U.S. bankruptcy A lawyer for Red Lobster Canada, Inc. says he will ask an Ontario court today to recognize and enforce the chain’s U.S. bankruptcy protection proceedings, a process which documents show could include selling Canadian assets. An affidavit filed in an Ontario court from the chief executive of Red Lobster Management LLC says the goal of the U.S.proceedings is to orchestrate a sale of most or all of the company’s assets, including those owned by Red Lobster Canada. The filing from Jonathan Tibus says the seafood restaurant company operates 27 Canadian locations across Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan and has 2,000 Canadian employees, who are mostly part-time and non-unionized. Gildan shareholders to vote on board Gildan Activewear Inc. shareholders will have a chance this morning to weigh in on a slate of directors put forward by activist investors. Shareholders of the Montreal-based apparel manufacturing company will be able to vote on whether the eight nominees should be elected to the board. Included in the group is Glenn Chamandy, Gildan's co-founder, who took the helm of the company last week after being ousted from the top job last year amid accusations that he was no longer fit to run the firm. Activist shareholders, including Browning West, pushed for Chamandy's return for months, even as former Fruit of the Loom executive Vince Tyra took over Gildan's CEO post. Pregnant people with disabilities face care gaps A new report says one in eight people who are pregnant in Ontario has a disability, but many face barriers to accessible care, as well as disrespectful attitudes from doctors and other care providers. Lead author Hilary Brown from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences says people with disabilities have been overlooked in reproductive health care because of societal assumptions that they won't have children. Brown says some disabled participants in the study told researchers that nurses and doctors assumed they wanted to get abortions when they were seeking pregnancy care. The report published on Tuesday calls for more education and training about disabilities for physicians, nurses and other care providers who work with pregnant people. New grassland conservation area in southeast B.C. The Nature Conservancy of Canada says a new conservation area north of Cranbrook, B.C., will protect important bird habitat and preserve grasslands in the province's southeast. The conservancy says money from the federal government and private donors went to buying up 271 hectares of land in the Skookumchuk Prairie in the province's southeast corner. Richard Klafki, a B.C. program director with the Nature Conservancy, says the land which also includes wetlands and forests is a \"key biodiversity area,\" and came up for sale when the former owner, a local rancher, decided to downsize.

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) has afforded a multitude of benefits through its automation capabilities, such as efficiency gains, cost savings, and a boost for product innovation and development. According to new research from , the foremost use case in terms of software revenue is virtual assistants, which are projected to generate more than for IT vendors by 2028. The new research from (FS) report finds that virtual assistants are the most prevalent use case, primarily utilized for internal purposes. However, this trend is expected to shift as nearly half of retail banks state that their top front-office priority is providing a more consistent and sophisticated interaction with their contact centers. \"Although many banks are striving to be pioneers in launching generative AI (GenAI)-based virtual assistants as a tool for attracting new customers, there is a danger that it could alienate existing customers if not executed effectively,\" said . detection and mitigation stand out as another top use case for AI in FS, especially as fraudsters increasingly leverage AI to exploit weaknesses within internal banking controls. However, banks are also adopting AI to combat . Omdia expects that management will remain a central use case for predictive AI, rather than GenAI. Omdia forecasts that AI software revenue for detection and mitigation will reach by 2028, with a CAGR of 16% from 2023 to 2028. Wealth management firms are also implementing generative AI to enhance client service and efficiency. This technology will assist wealth managers in streamlining internal searches and developing relevant research for specific client requirements. noted, \"Financial institutions are now deploying AI internally to aid investment research, market analysis, and portfolio construction and rebalancing.\" The report is available now in and and, as well as the applications in financial services, covers the ecosystem, regulatory developments and market outlook for predictive and generative AI.

TOUKOKUUTA 2024 KLO 11.15 Sisäpiiritieto: MacGregor on sopinut kiistan merituulivoimaloiden asennusalusasiakkaan kanssa ja Cargotec aloittaa MacGregorin myyntiprosessin Cargotec ilmoitti 30. huhtikuuta 2024 julkaistun tammi–maaliskuun 2024 osavuosikatsauksen yhteydessä kiistasta, joka MacGregorilla on ollut yhteen ja ainoaan merituulivoimaloiden asennusalusprojektiin liittyen. MacGregor on nyt sopinut kiistan asiakkaan kanssa. Kiistan sopimisella on noin 25 miljoonan euron negatiivinen vaikutus MacGregorin vuoden 2024 toisen vuosineljänneksen liikevoittoon. Kulut kirjataan vertailtavuuteen vaikuttavana eränä, koska ne liittyvät yksittäiseen pilottiprojektiin ja kyseinen tuote ei ole enää MacGregorin myyntivalikoimassa. Kuluilla ei ole vaikutusta Cargotecin 1. helmikuuta 2024 julkaisemiin MacGregorin vuoden 2024 näkymiin. Cargotec arvioi MacGregorin vuoden 2024 vertailukelpoisen liikevoiton paranevan vuodesta 2023 (33 miljoonaa euroa). MacGregorin ydinliiketoiminnot kauppalaivasegmentti ja huoltoliiketoiminta suoriutuvat hyvin. Sen sijaan offshore-liiketoiminnan suoritus ei ole ollut tyydyttävällä tasolla. Offshore-liiketoiminnan sisällä perinteisten offshore-ratkaisujen liiketoiminta on suoriutunut hyvin ja ollut kannattavaa, mutta kahteen uuteen merituulivoimaratkaisuun liittyvät projektit ovat aiheuttaneet tappioita niiden pilottiluontoisuuden ja teknisten ongelmien vuoksi. MacGregor on päättänyt tästä syystä lopettaa merituulivoimaloiden asennuksessa käytettävän ratkaisun tarjoamisen, ja kyseinen tuote ei ole enää MacGregorin myyntivalikoimassa. Toinen, uutta teknologiaa sisältävä merituulivoimaloiden huollossa käytettävä ratkaisu säilyy edelleen osana MacGregorin tarjoomaa. Tähän ratkaisuun liittyvät noin kymmenen pienempää tappiollista merituulivoima-pilottiprojektia saadaan pääosin päätökseen vuonna 2024. MacGregor ei ota uusia pilottiprojekteja, kunnes tekniset haasteet on ratkaistu. Toimenpiteet ovat viimeinen vaihe uudelleenjärjestelyohjelmaa, jonka tavoitteena on saada aikaan offshore-liiketoiminnan kannattavuuskäänne. Merituulivoimaprojektit muodostavat alle puolet MacGregorin offshore-laitteiden tilauskannasta, joka oli 87 (Q1/23: 134) miljoonaa euroa vuoden 2024 ensimmäisen vuosineljänneksen lopussa. Cargotecin hallitus päätti 14. marraskuuta 2022, että MacGregor ei tulevaisuudessa kuulu Cargotecin portfolioon. Arvonluonnin näkökulmasta ajoitus liiketoiminnasta luopumiseksi ei kuitenkaan ollut optimaalinen. MacGregorin suorituskyky ja markkinaolosuhteet ovat sittemmin parantuneet selkeästi, ja nyt kun edellä mainittu kiista on saatu sovittua, Cargotec on nyt päättänyt aloittaa MacGregorin myyntiprosessin. “Merituulivoimaloiden asennusaluskiistan sopiminen asiakkaan kanssa on meille tärkeä virstanpylväs. Ratkaisumme on teknisesti kehittynyt, mutta emme päässeet yhtiöiden välillä yhteisymmärrykseen pitkän projektin seuraavista askelista. Nyt kun kiista on ratkaistu, olemme kannattavuuden parantamisen kannalta entistä vahvemmassa asemassa”, sanoo MacGregorin johtaja Leif Byström.

        "content": "CARGOTEC CORPORATION, INSIDE INFORMATION, 28 MAY 2024 AT 11:15 AM (EEST) Inside information: MacGregor settles the dispute with a monopile installation vessel customer and Cargotec starts the sales process of MacGregor As announced on 30 April 2024 in conjunction with Cargotec’s interim report January–March 2024, MacGregor has had a dispute related to one and only monopile installation vessel project. MacGregor and the customer have now settled this dispute. The settlement will have an approximately EUR 25 million negative impact on MacGregor’s second quarter 2024 operating profit. The costs will be reported as items affecting comparability as the costs are related to a one of its kind pilot project and the product is no longer in MacGregor’s sales portfolio. Booking of the settlement cost will not impact Cargotec’s outlook on MacGregor’s comparable operating profit for 2024, which was published on 1 February 2024. Cargotec estimates MacGregor’s comparable operating profit in 2024 to improve from 2023 (EUR 33 million). MacGregor’s core businesses, merchant and services, are performing well. MacGregor’s offshore business’ performance, however, has been overall unsatisfactory. While the traditional offshore solutions business has performed well and it has been profitable, projects related to two new offshore wind solutions have caused losses due to their pilot nature and technical challenges. MacGregor has therefore now decided to stop offering the monopile installation solution and it is no longer in MacGregor’s sales portfolio. Another offshore wind solution, containing advanced technologies for the servicing of offshore wind turbines, is still a part of MacGregor offering. There are approximately ten of these smaller loss-making offshore pilot projects to be finalised mainly in 2024. MacGregor will not commit to any new pilot projects until all technical challenges are solved. These actions are the final stage of the restructuring programme to turn around the offshore business. Offshore wind projects represent less than half of MacGregor’s offshore equipment related order book, which amounted to EUR 87 (Q1/23: 134) million at the end of the first quarter 2024. Cargotec’s Board of Directors decided on 14 November 2022 that MacGregor will not be part of Cargotec’s portfolio in the future. However, from a value creation perspective, the timing for divesting the business was not ideal. Since that, MacGregor’s performance and market conditions have clearly improved, and with the above-described dispute now being settled, Cargotec has decided to proceed with the sale process of MacGregor. “It is an important milestone for us to reach a settlement with the customer related to the monopile installation vessel project. Our solution is technically advanced but we were unable to reach agreement between the companies on the way forward in the lengthy project. Having the dispute resolved means that we are in an even stronger position than before to further build on our profitability journey,” says Leif Byström, President, MacGregor.

We have already passed laws related to that. However, it's still pending in the Supreme Court,\" the senator said in Filipino.Escudero was referring to Republic Act (RA) 11659, a modification to the Public Service Act. This legislation lifts the 40 percent limit on foreign ownership in sectors like telecommunications, airports, railways, and airlines. The bill was signed into law by then-president Rodrigo Duterte in May 2022.Nonetheless, there are unresolved issues concerning RA 11659 at the Supreme Court.Escudero said that the President held the authority to call for the convening of the JELACC to identify and compile a list of pending cases that the executive and legislative branches aimed to address.RBH 6, introduced by former Senate president Juan Miguel Zubiri, suggests modifications to Articles XII, XIV, and XVI of the 1987 Constitution, focusing on public services, education, and advertising.",

        "content": "THE Channel 5 reboot of the hit series Challenge Anneka has been pulled off air after just three episodes after ratings flop. The broadcaster has kept the final episode on the shelf for more than a year due to the timeslot being \"highly competitive.\" A Channel 5 spokesman said: “The first episode of 'Challenge Anneka' was enjoyed by 1.25 million viewers, but Saturday evenings are always highly competitive, especially at this time of year. “The public and critical reaction to Challenge Anneka’s return has been amazing and we have decided to preserve the remaining two shows and reschedule them soon. \"We want to preserve the series to ensure that each episode gets the best audience possible.\" Anneka , 64, replied to concerned viewers on social media about the production on the show and the challenging deadlines. The TV presenter wrote on X: “Thanks if you’ve watched so far! We always knew we were on a 'floating schedule' so might be bumped off at any moment. We’ll keep you posted. \"The main thing for me is the projects are all up and running and I love [and] salute our army of volunteers who made this possible. Thank you.” She added it was time to find a new home for the show writing: \"24 hours to find a new home”. The former Strictly Come Dancing contestant also revealed how proud she is of the way her series featured many women behind the camera. She penned: \"It was mostly women. It was ground breaking stuff. Many of them have gone on to practically run television.\" The third episode of the series was branded as a 'Dementia Special'. It saw Anneka challenged by Age UK Wirral to create a giant memory village for people suffering with dementia, building shops, a cafe and a village green, and throwing an opening party. In the episode yet to air, Anneka and the Challenge team come to the aid of Luton Sea and Royal Marine Cadets to design a medal for outstanding achievement and refurbish their training facilities. Channel 5 have provided no update on then the final episode will air. Challenge Anneka is available on My5 .",

Was für ein Wahnsinnsspektakel: Der VfL Bochum bleibt dank einer irren Aufholjagd bei Fortuna Düsseldorf in der Bundesliga. Ein Fußball-Wunder ohne Ankündigung. Denn dass dem VfL nach dem niederschmetternden 0:3 im Relegationshinspiel tatsächlich noch die Wende gelingen würde, daran dürften im Vorlauf selbst kühnste Optimisten kaum mehr einen Gedanken verschwendet haben. Zu wenig Hoffnung versprachen die sportlich unterirdischen vergangenen Wochen, die teils blutleeren Auftritte und scheppernden Pleiten, die den Revierklub überhaupt erst in die Relegationsbredouille manövriert hatten. 0:5 (gegen Bayer Leverkusen) und 1:4 (gegen Werder Bremen) lauteten die ernüchternden Resultate zum Saisonabschluss. Es folgte die Unruhe um Stammkeeper Manuel Riemann, der für die Relegationspartien aus dem Kader flog und die deftige Niederlage gegen Düsseldorf vor heimischer Kulisse. Der siebte Bundesliga -Abstieg der Vereinsgeschichte schien besiegelt. Anschließende Durchhalteparolen und Kampfansagen wirkten nurmehr obligatorisch. Aufgeben in aller Öffentlichkeit - die Blöße wollte man sich an der Castroper Straße trotz der schier aussichtslosen Lage nicht geben. „Aggressivität, Intensität, Leidenschaft und Haltung - bis zum Schlusspfiff“ beschwor etwa Trainer Heiko Butscher in den vier Tagen zwischen Hin- und Rückspiel gebetsmühlenartig - so lange, bis nicht nur er, sondern auch seine Spieler offenbar wieder an ein furioses Comeback glaubten. Denn was der VfL in Düsseldorf ablieferte, hätten einer verunsicherten Mannschaft mit all dem Frust der Vorwochen im Hinterkopf nur die wenigsten zugetraut. Vollgasfußball, Wille und Leidenschaft - über 120 Minuten feinste Unterhaltung. Fanherz, was willst du mehr? Dass sich das Investment am Ende eines dramatischen Elfmeterschießens (6:5) auch noch auszahlte, markierte zumindest aus Bochumer Sicht das Happy End einer wilden Achterbahnfahrt der Gefühle - und der sportlichen Leistung. Am Ende darf sich nicht nur der VfL-Anhänger, sondern auch der gemeine Nicht-Düsseldorf-Fan in Bochum für einen atemberaubenden Flutlichtabend und einen würdigen Abschluss einer Saison bedanken, in der es mit Bayer Leverkusen als deutschem Meister oder dem 1. FC Heidenheim als Europapokal-Teilnehmer viele Überraschungen gab. Mehr zum Thema Zurück bleibt nun eine Erkenntnis, die aus deutscher Sicht mit Blick auf ein Champions-League -Finale, in dem Borussia Dortmund gegen Rekordchampion Real Madrid als klarer Underdog daherkommt, sowie die danach anstehende Heim-Europameisterschaft nicht unerheblich ist. Eine Erkenntnis, die trotz scheinbar zunehmend schwindender Fußballromantik im von Geld getriebenen Geschäft auch zukünftig große Herzschlagmomente verspricht.

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister’s palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week’s joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied. The diplomatic drama, however, is unlikely to have any impact on the war in Gaza — or the long-running conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. ___ Melanie Lidman contributed to this report from Tel Aviv. ___ Follow AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "Listen to Story Three police officers in Kerala, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), were suspended after they were found feasting at a goon's residence during a surprise raid. MG Sabu, the DSP of the Alappuzha Crime Branch, hid in the bathroom when he saw the police team heading to the house. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his capacity as the state's Home Minister, ordered the suspension of the three officers. The Angamaly police carried out the raid at Thammanan Faisal's residence on Monday evening as part of 'Operation AAG (Action Against Goons)'. The operation is being conducted across the state to crackdown on criminal gangs. The police team received information that four people had reached Faisal's house in a private car. But they were in for a surprise when they found the four officers attending the feast organised by the goon. The four officers were taken to a police station and their statements were recorded. The officers included one from the Vigilance Department, who has not been suspended yet due to procedural formalities. The Aluva Rural SP has been asked to submit a report on the incident.",

As per income tax rules, if a Permanent Account Number (PAN) is not linked with biometric Aadhaar, TDS is required to be deducted at double the applicable rate. Last month, the income tax department issued a circular stating that no action will be taken for short deduction of TDS in case the assessee links his/her PAN with Aadhaar by May 31. “Please link your PAN with Aadhaar before May 31, 2024, if you haven’t already, in order to avoid tax deduction at a higher rate,” the department posted on X. In a separate post, the I-T department asked reporting entities, including banks, forex dealers, to file SFT by May 31 to avoid penalties. “The deadline to file SFT (Statement of Specified Financial Transactions) is May 31, 2024. Avoid penalties by filing accurately and on time,” the department said. The reporting entities which are required to file SFT returns with tax authorities include forex dealers, banks, sub-registrar, NBFC, post offices, issuer of bonds/debentures, mutual fund trustees, company paying dividend or buying back shares. These specified institutions are required to furnish the details of certain financial transactions or any reportable account registered/recorded/maintained by them during the year. Delay in filing of SFT returns may attract a penalty of up to Rs 1,000 for each day of default. Non-filing or filing inaccurate statement may also lead to levy of penalty. Through SFT, the income tax department keeps a track of high value transactions undertaken by an individual.

        "content": "Australia's \"most tattooed woman\" has taken her body art obsession to the next level by getting horns implanted in her head. Ink-addicted lass, Amber Luke, who's also known as the \"Dragon Girl\" on social media, has previously made waves for her extreme look. She once even lost her vision for three weeks . Not one to shy away from pain, Amber recently endured another excruciating session to add to her £144,000 worth of and . Taking to , the blonde bombshell unveiled her latest transformation, showing off her horn implants to her followers with a series of up-close snaps. A glance at her forehead reveals two prominent raised areas resembling horns positioned above her eyes, complete with visible stitch marks where the skin has been sutured. Since flaunting her new horns, Amber has been bombarded with questions, although some fans weren't too shocked by her daring choice. It appears her followers are keenly watching her transformation journey, and are eager to see what she'll do next. One fan exclaimed: \"I was wondering if you were ever gonna get horns! Perfect for you! Can't wait to see what's next. Making me wanna book my next mod seeing you get all this fun stuff recently.\" Another commented: \"Your look just keeps getting better and better! Saw you at chermside a few weeks ago and wanted to say hi but got shy.\" A third gushed: \"Amazing. You continue to be such an inspiration.\" Meanwhile, a fourth added: \"Mega beautiful implants.\" While heaps of fans were quick to shower her with compliments on her daring new look, there were some who were left scratching their heads in bewilderment. It seems for some, is a whole new world. One puzzled follower queried: \"I'm confused what exactly you had done?\" Another echoed the confusion, asking: \"What holds them in place under the skin?\" For Amber, who's no stranger to turning heads with her unique style, the attention is nothing new. With a massive fanbase that adore her unique aesthetic, she's a true icon in the world of bold and striking body art. Not content with just ink, the 27-year-old Brisbane-based model is all about pushing the envelope with body mods. She sports stretched ears, a bifurcated tongue and dermal piercings that sit beneath the skin's surface. But Amber hasn't stopped there, as she's also invested in some serious plastic surgery to craft her image. From breast enhancements to a butt lift, not to mention lip fillers - she's no stranger to cosmetic procedures. Previously, Amber has been candid about her transformation journey, sharing: \"Pictured on the left a girl; at that stage feeling lost feeling disconnected from herself. Pictured right a woman; at that stage feeling turmoil; although resilience radiates. \"These two women had a choice. To be the person on the left and be miserably ignorant to my own wants and needs in life and was projecting hatred onto others - for the inner pain was too confrontational to stand. \"Or be the woman on the right - someone who dominates their brain and emotions and embraces charismatic traits. I am someone who takes accountability and responsibility. \"I am Amber Luke. You will either love it or f***in despise it.\"",

        "content": "Fedez e Cristiano Iovino hanno firmato un accordo dopo il caso del pestaggio avvenuto nella notte tra il 21 e il 22 aprile scorso, quando il personal trainer dei vip venne aggredito in via Traiano, a Milano, da un gruppo di 8-9 persone. Secondo alcuni testimoni, il rapper era presente «senza ombra di dubbio». Se fosse confermato, resterebbe in piedi il reato di rissa, per il quale Federico Leonardo Lucia (il vero nome di Fedez) è indagato. L'accordo tra i due farà invece decadere le accuse di lesioni e percosse nei confronti dell’artista. Il pestaggio: cosa si vede nel video La dinamica dell'episodio dello scontro tra Fedez e Iovino, così com'è stata immortalata dalla telecamera, non lascia intendere che ci sia stata una discussione sul posto tra i due, piuttosto una spedizione punitiva, fanno notare gli investigatori. Nel video si vede una figura esile (che dovrebbe essere Fedez) scendere dal van e dirigersi per primo verso Iovino, provando a colpirlo senza successo. «Io non c'ero e dalla telecamera non si vede niente», aveva detto il cantante. «Tutti parlano di un massacro - ha aggiunto - ma se questa persona non è stata portata in ospedale, non c'è un referto medico e non ha denunciato, di cosa stiamo a parlare? Oltretutto poco dopo è andato a ballare a Ibiza». Nel video anche una bionda Intanto, le indagini della Procura di Milano vanno avanti per identificare tutti gli aggressori, tra cui ci sarebbero stati anche ultrà della curva sud milanista, tra cui, Christian Rosiello, anche «guardia del corpo» di Fedez.",

        "description": "The officer found himself in the vehicle with the female suspect after he arrested her on suspicion of stealing a car.",
        "content": "A San Diego police officer has resigned after he was caught locked in the backseat of his squad car with a female detainee who propositioned him for sex last year, newly released bodycam footage showed. Officer Anthony Hair left his post about a month after a probe was launched into the August 2023 incident and one day before he was to meet with investigators for his second scheduled interview. Hair, who had been with SDPD for two years, found himself in the vehicle with the female suspect after he arrested her on suspicion of stealing a car outside of a convenience store, according to CBS 8 . The suspect, who has not been named, was one of two people wanted for car theft. She also had a bench warrant out for her arrest. After Hair arrested her, he was supposed to bring her to police headquarters and later to the Las Colinas Detention Center in Santee, Calif., for questioning. In bodycam footage released by the SDPD, the suspect was heard propositioning the officer for sex after asking him if he was married. “You’re not too bad. What’s it gonna hurt me if I work the system, you know what I mean? That’s the way I see s–t,” she told Hair. “Are you single?” she added, to which he responded, “Yeah, but you’re not.” “I’m down to f–k right now,” she told him, before he interrupts, “Don’t say that right now...Don’t say that right now because everything is being recorded right now.” As the pair approached the detention center, Hair can be heard asking the female suspect what she was doing in the backseat. Hair turned off his bodycam and slowed his vehicle as he drove onto a residential street, the outlet added. About 20 minutes later, Hair called for a fellow officer to help him out of the police car over the embarrassing mishap. “I asked him if he was okay. He said, yes, and then asked if I had my patrol car key with me...I asked why he was asking and what did he need,” the unidentified officer said of Hair, describing him as panicked. “Officer Hair then asked me If I could go meet him.” “I asked him his location and he said, near Cottonwood... I asked him why he needed me, and he said he would tell me when I got there. He said he was really embarrassed.” Investigators reported that Hair believed the woman was suffering from a medical emergency, according to NBC San Diego . Hair and the woman denied anything untoward happened, as the officer claimed he was “checking” on the suspect in the back. “When I was waking her up, that’s when I noticed that this door closed on me. That’s when I was trying to kind of open the door,” Hair said in the clip. San Diego police found traces of semen on Hair’s belt, CBS reported. “He wanted to get with me when I was done with the warrant or whatever I got arrested for,” she said. It’s unclear if he faces any criminal charges over the ordeal. The Post has reached out to the San Diego Police Department for comment.",

        "description": "The Labour leader was critical of both the Conservative Government at Westminster and the SNP Government at Holyrood.",
        "content": "Scotland will be “key to delivering the change” the UK needs in the General Election, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted. The UK Labour leader said voters in Scotland have an “opportunity too important to miss” to help “lead that change” and install his party into power at Westminster. Writing in the Daily Record newspaper, Sir Keir said if he is “privileged enough” to be the next prime minister his government will be “on the side of working people”. He said: “Instead of preying on the fears of working people, the government I lead will be dedicated to restoring the ordinary hope important to working Scots.” He spoke out as polls once again showed support for Labour ahead of that for the SNP – which has long been the dominant party in Scottish politics. Stressing that “Scotland is key to delivering the change our entire country needs”, the Labour leader added that voters north of the border “have been forced to pay the price for the failures of two chaotic and dysfunctional governments, both hopelessly divided and embroiled in scandal”. He accused the SNP at Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster of having formed “two Governments that put their own party interests ahead of the national interests at every turn”. Sir Keir said: “Here in Scotland the NHS is in chaos, with almost one in six Scots on waiting lists, and we have been plunged into a housing crisis. “And at Westminster, the Tories have destroyed the national finances through reckless stewardship of the economy.” But he said the election is “Scotland’s chance to stop this chaos” and to “restore decency and integrity in politics”. He pledged Labour would create jobs in Scotland, with the publicly-owned GB Energy to be based north of the border. Sir Keir also said Grangemouth, Scotland’s only oil refinery, where there are plans to convert it to an oil import terminal, would be the “home to the industries of the future”, saying there could be a “decarbonisation hub and a linked carbon capture and storage project” at the site. He added: “With a Labour government, Scotland will be at the forefront of the transition to green energy – creating jobs and lowering bills for Scots.” His comments came as former Tesco Bank CEO Benny Higgins – who previously worked with the SNP government to help set up the Scottish National Investment Bank and also chaired a Scottish Government advisory group on post Covid economic recovery – insisted it is “only by choosing Labour that we can find hope and optimism”. Writing in The Herald newspaper he claimed that Scotland had “suffered from the political malaise created by the Tories in Westminster and the SNP in Holyrood”. He went on to accuse SNP ministers of having failed to implement most of the recommendations from his report on economic recovery post-pandemic. Mr Higgins said: “To support a society that cares about social justice, the NHS, social care and so much more, we need a vibrant economy. We need to make it an easy choice to invest in Scotland. “We need government to support and encourage businesses, not hinder them. “It is precisely four years ago that I was completing my report for the Scottish Government on economic recovery beyond the pandemic. All 25 recommendations were warmly welcomed and accepted. “Most have barely been mentioned since then.”",

        "description": "The Labour leader was critical of both the Conservative Government at Westminster and the SNP Government at Holyrood.",
        "content": "Scotland will be “key to delivering the change” the UK needs in the General Election, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted. The UK Labour leader said voters in Scotland have an “opportunity too important to miss” to help “lead that change” and install his party into power at Westminster. Writing in the Daily Record newspaper, Sir Keir said if he is “privileged enough” to be the next prime minister his government will be “on the side of working people”. He said: “Instead of preying on the fears of working people, the government I lead will be dedicated to restoring the ordinary hope important to working Scots.” He spoke out as polls once again showed support for Labour ahead of that for the SNP – which has long been the dominant party in Scottish politics. Stressing that “Scotland is key to delivering the change our entire country needs”, the Labour leader added that voters north of the border “have been forced to pay the price for the failures of two chaotic and dysfunctional governments, both hopelessly divided and embroiled in scandal”. He accused the SNP at Holyrood and the Tories at Westminster of having formed “two Governments that put their own party interests ahead of the national interests at every turn”. Sir Keir said: “Here in Scotland the NHS is in chaos, with almost one in six Scots on waiting lists, and we have been plunged into a housing crisis. “And at Westminster, the Tories have destroyed the national finances through reckless stewardship of the economy.” But he said the election is “Scotland’s chance to stop this chaos” and to “restore decency and integrity in politics”. He pledged Labour would create jobs in Scotland, with the publicly-owned GB Energy to be based north of the border. Sir Keir also said Grangemouth, Scotland’s only oil refinery, where there are plans to convert it to an oil import terminal, would be the “home to the industries of the future”, saying there could be a “decarbonisation hub and a linked carbon capture and storage project” at the site. He added: “With a Labour government, Scotland will be at the forefront of the transition to green energy – creating jobs and lowering bills for Scots.” His comments came as former Tesco Bank CEO Benny Higgins – who previously worked with the SNP government to help set up the Scottish National Investment Bank and also chaired a Scottish Government advisory group on post Covid economic recovery – insisted it is “only by choosing Labour that we can find hope and optimism”. Writing in The Herald newspaper he claimed that Scotland had “suffered from the political malaise created by the Tories in Westminster and the SNP in Holyrood”. He went on to accuse SNP ministers of having failed to implement most of the recommendations from his report on economic recovery post-pandemic. Mr Higgins said: “To support a society that cares about social justice, the NHS, social care and so much more, we need a vibrant economy. We need to make it an easy choice to invest in Scotland. “We need government to support and encourage businesses, not hinder them. “It is precisely four years ago that I was completing my report for the Scottish Government on economic recovery beyond the pandemic. All 25 recommendations were warmly welcomed and accepted. “Most have barely been mentioned since then.”",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 TAGTHAi has launched a new initiative in collaboration with Dhipaya Insurance to boost tourist safety in Thailand. By offering free accident insurance, “Dhipaya Takaful,” to users of the TAGTHAi Pass, the program aims to enhance the travel experience and ensure the well-being of visitors. This initiative is a key component of the “Safe Thailand” campaign and is aligned with efforts to stimulate tourism and support the national economy. Tourists aged 20 to 70 who purchase the TAGTHAi Pass will automatically receive the “Dhipaya Takaful” accident insurance at no additional cost. The insurance provides round-the-clock coverage for the duration of the virtual travel card, which is valid from today until March 31, 2025, or until all policies have been claimed. This offer not only aims to attract a broader demographic of visitors but also underscores Thailand’s commitment to tourist safety. Mrs. Thiratida Kuvantrarai , CEO of Thai Digital Platform Social Enterprise Co., Ltd., a national tourism platform service provider, “ TAGTHAi ”, said that it was a pleasure to join hands with Dhipaya Insurance to provide an accident insurance, “Dhipaya Takaful” to all tourists who purchase any types of TAGTHAi Pass for safe travel in Thailand. We hope that this collaboration could contribute to the quality and a positive image for Thai tourism. “Accident insurance is significantly related to our lives because, in our daily lives, accidents can happen at any time, such as road accidents, car crashes, or slips and falls. Thus, having accident insurance coverage while traveling can reduce the risk of expenses and facilitates medical treatment, creating positive impression for tourists while traveling in Thailand.” Dr. Pollarat Ekkayokkaya , Vice President of Sales and Marketing 2, of Dhipaya Insurance Public Company Limited, said that Dhipaya Insurance, with over 72 years of expertise, understands the needs of all groups of customer. So, we have designed “Dhipaya Takaful,” the first insurance policy in Thailand compliant with Islamic principles, to ensure comprehensive coverage for everyone. “This joining will enhance tourists’ confidence with the accident insurance, which has a maximum coverage of 70,000 Baht, covering medical expenses, death, disability compensation, and emergency transfer or body transportation costs. All tourists who utilize the TAGTHAi Pass will receive this coverage, and we hope that this benefit could enhance Thailand’s tourism industry.” The accident insurance, specifically offered to tourists who purchase TAGTHAi Pass (totaling 2,500 insurance policies), is available to tourists of all nations and religions as it adheres to Islamic principles, similar to Halal food, which are foods that people from all religions and beliefs can consume.” This strategic partnership between TAGTHAi and Dhipaya Insurance is part of the broader Government Tourism Stimulating Project. It seeks to draw tourists from various countries and religions, reinforcing Thailand’s position as a hospitable and safe destination. The initiative also plays a crucial role in driving economic growth through the tourism sector, promising a safer and more inviting travel environment for all visitors.",

Med drugim je zalilo podvoz pod Celovško in Dunajsko cesto, kjer je promet zaprt. Po podatkih Agencije RS za okolje (Arso) reke še niso poplavljale. Nevihte naj bi se pojavljale tudi danes, poroča spletna stran neurje.si. V Ljubljani je prav tako zalilo okolico farmacevtske družbe Lek in poplavilo podvoz pod Drenikovo cesto, kjer je promet usmerjala policija. “Čisto osnovne zadeve nam padajo pred našimi očmi, javna infrastruktura, javno zdravstvo in šolstvo ipd., mi pa se ukvarjamo z minornimi vprašanji kot sta evtanazija ali marihuana. Res smo posebni (norci),” je prof. dr. Miro Haček , visokošolski učitelj na Katedri za analizo politik in javno upravo na FDV, komentiral zadnje poplave pod podvozi na ljubljanskih ulicah. Ljubljano so padavine zajele okoli 19. ure, že popoldne pa je na severozahodu države padala sodra. Na Arsu pa so opozorili tudi pred pojavom toče v Ljubljani in okolici, na Notranjskem in Goriškem. Po podatkih Arsa naj bi bilo ponoči delno jasno, do jutra pa se bo vreme pooblačilo, najnižje jutranje temperature bodo od 8 do 14 stopinj Celzija, na Primorskem pa do 16 stopinj Celzija. Danes dopoldne pa bodo padavine in nevihte zajele večji del države. Najvišje dnevne temperature bodo od 15 do 21, na Primorskem in v jugovzhodni Sloveniji do 24 stopinj Celzija. Kot so zapisali na spletni strani neurje.si, se nam bliža meteorološko poletje, vendar vreme ne bo prav nič poletno. Tudi verjetnostna napoved nakazuje nadaljevanje nestabilnega vremena s pogostimi plohami in nevihtami. Nekaj več padavin lahko po njihovih podatkih pričakujemo ob koncu meseca, ko se bo nad Francijo in Španijo iz severozahoda pomaknilo višinsko jedro, ki bo z jugozahodnim vetrovnim strženom poskrbelo za več vlažnega zraka in posledičnih padavin.",

        "content": "Transfer windows over the past couple of seasons have been dominated by the Blues with Todd Boehly circumventing the Premier League’s rules in order to bring in some expensive reinforcements at Stamford Bridge. His largesse has also seen a fire sale of players, with another perhaps required this summer if the American continues to buy at the very top end of the market. Xavi Simons doesn’t want Chelsea or Newcastle switch When some of the best players in Europe potentially come up for loan or purchase, it stands to reason that there will be various storied teams vying for their services. In Xavi Simons’ case, he appears to be able to have the pick of a number of clubs. According to , the current Paris Saint-Germain ace is wanted by Bayern Munich, RB Leipzig – where he’s been on loan this season, Man United, Chelsea and Newcastle. Luis Enrique also wants to utilise him next season for PSG, however, he doesn’t see himself at any of those clubs, with the outlet reporting he wants a return to Barcelona. Simons was one of the stars of Barca’s academy, La Masia, but left the club before he’d given himself a chance to become a first-team regular. Mundo Deportivo note that Barcelona’s current financial predicament makes any transfer, loan or otherwise, difficult, and it’s also worth noting that the Blaugranes are very well stocked in the midfield department in any event. That’s unlikely to deter the 21-year-old, however, and if manager-elect, Hansi Flick, accedes to the deal, it could mean that either Joao Felix’s loan isn’t extended, or one of the current crop of midfielders are sold to accommodate a player that has been schooled in the Barca style of play. If the player is unable to have his wish granted, then the Premier League sides might fancy their chances again. In the meantime they’ll need to sit and wait and see how things play out.",

        "content": "Piše: G. B. Včeraj v pozno popoldanskih urah se je v osrednji Sloveniji, nad Ljubljano razbesnela nevihta z močnim deževjem. Posledice so bile vidne predvsem na cestah. Med drugim je zalilo podvoz pod Celovško in Dunajsko cesto, kjer je promet zaprt. Po podatkih Agencije RS za okolje (Arso) reke še niso poplavljale. Nevihte naj bi se pojavljale tudi danes, poroča spletna stran neurje.si. V Ljubljani je prav tako zalilo okolico farmacevtske družbe Lek in poplavilo podvoz pod Drenikovo cesto, kjer je promet usmerjala policija. “Čisto osnovne zadeve nam padajo pred našimi očmi, javna infrastruktura, javno zdravstvo in šolstvo ipd., mi pa se ukvarjamo z minornimi vprašanji kot sta evtanazija ali marihuana. Res smo posebni (norci),” je prof. dr. Miro Haček , visokošolski učitelj na Katedri za analizo politik in javno upravo na FDV, komentiral zadnje poplave pod podvozi na ljubljanskih ulicah. Ljubljano so padavine zajele okoli 19. ure, že popoldne pa je na severozahodu države padala sodra. Na Arsu pa so opozorili tudi pred pojavom toče v Ljubljani in okolici, na Notranjskem in Goriškem. Po podatkih Arsa naj bi bilo ponoči delno jasno, do jutra pa se bo vreme pooblačilo, najnižje jutranje temperature bodo od 8 do 14 stopinj Celzija, na Primorskem pa do 16 stopinj Celzija. Danes dopoldne pa bodo padavine in nevihte zajele večji del države. Najvišje dnevne temperature bodo od 15 do 21, na Primorskem in v jugovzhodni Sloveniji do 24 stopinj Celzija. Kot so zapisali na spletni strani neurje.si, se nam bliža meteorološko poletje, vendar vreme ne bo prav nič poletno. Tudi verjetnostna napoved nakazuje nadaljevanje nestabilnega vremena s pogostimi plohami in nevihtami. Nekaj več padavin lahko po njihovih podatkih pričakujemo ob koncu meseca, ko se bo nad Francijo in Španijo iz severozahoda pomaknilo višinsko jedro, ki bo z jugozahodnim vetrovnim strženom poskrbelo za več vlažnega zraka in posledičnih padavin.",

        "content": "Olympic-bound Emile Cairess, Calli Hauger-Thackery and Rose Harvey are also in action over 10km in our latest UK-wide distance running results round-up Vincent Ngetich scored a comfortable 10km victory at the AJ Bell Great Manchester Run on Sunday (May 26) in a personal best of 27:25 with Jack Rayner of Australia runner-up as Adel Mechaal of Spain sprinted past Bashir Abdi of Belgium for third. The Kenyan cruised through the first half in 13:54 before injecting pace and running the second half in 13:31 as he won by 19 seconds. “It was good to run a PB today,” said Ngetich, whose marathon best is a sizzling 2:03:13 from Berlin last year. “After not being selected for the Olympics, I was determined to train hard to run a PB.” Racing just over a month after clocking 2:06:46 in the London Marathon, Britain’s Emile Cairess was back in action finishing fifth in 27:57. Cairess said: “I’m just building back after London and have only done a few weeks training so wasn’t expecting much today. I’m injury free and healthy, which is great, though.” Gotytom Gebreslase became the first Ethiopian winner of the women’s race since Tirunesh Dibaba in 2018 as she clocked 30:32 to finish half a minute clear of Britain’s Calli Hauger-Thackery. “It’s my first time in Manchester so I’m very happy to win,” said Gebreslase, who is a reserve in the Ethiopian team for the Olympic marathon. Like Cairess, Hauger-Thackery has been selected for the Olympic marathon team but plans to race the half-marathon at next week’s European Championships in Rome. She said: “I really like this race a lot and did it for the first time last year and I remembered the final few miles are hard.” Rose Harvey is another Olympic marathon-bound Brit and after finishing ninth in Manchester she said: This was very much the start of my training block for Paris. This 10km is not my distance. I’m a marathon runner through and though but it was good to test my speed.” In the associated half-marathon, Crawley’s James Westlake came out on top in 66:34, more than a minute clear of Belgian Laurens Vanderlinden. This was a personal best by nearly two minutes for the Crawley runner. Sadly, however, organisers reported a 40-year-old man collapsed on the course and later died in hospital. “The entire team involved in organising the Great Manchester Run extends their heartfelt condolences to the participant’s family and friends,” said the organisers. 1 V Ngetich (KEN) 28:25; 2 J Rayner (AUS) 27:44; 3 A Mechaal (ESP) 27:46; 4 B Abdi (BEL) 27:46; 5 E Cairess (Leeds) 27:57; 6 S Moen (NOR) 27:57; 7 P Tiernan (AUS) 28:09; 8 S Hassan (SWE) 28:15; 9 B Kipruto (KEN) 28:17; 10 D Griffiths (Swan) 28:20; 11 M Geremew (ETH) 28:43; 12 J Mellor (Liv) 28:47; 13 F Tesu 28:51; 14 H Welday 29:06; 15 S Yonei 29:08; 16 H Armstrong (Balina) 29:13; 17 S Jamaal (Lon H) 29:14; 18 D Nilsson 29:21; 19 T Hinterdorfer 29:29; 20 L Bouchikhi 29:36; 21 C Avery (Morp) 29:45; 22 C Perry (Vale R) 30:03; 23 D Studley (B&W) 30:10; 24 D Bishop (Der) 30:14; 25 N Torry (Kent, M45) 30:15; 26 J Mehieu 30:16; 27 L Hannigan (Kilb) 30:18; 28 D Barratt (Salf) 30:39; 29 M Ferguson (A’deen) 30:31; 30 D Haynes (Der) 30:52 1 J Phillips (B’end) 33:05; 2 P Marsden 33:10 2 R Smith (Cov G) 32:04; 3 F Okumu (Army) 33:24 1 G Raven 33:26; 2 N Grinnell Neath) 34:42; 3 B Archbold (Wilm) 34:59 1 P Brame (Liv) 37:46 1 Gotytom Gebreslase (ETH) 30:32; 2 C Hauger-Thackery (Hallam) 31:02; 3 A Beriso (ETH) 31:13; 4 C Evans (P’pridd) 32:10; 5 B Saina (USA) 32:11; 6 L McNeill (Hallam) 32:14; 7 J Thomas 32;44; 8 L Partridge (Bir) 32:43; 9 R Harvey (Clap) 32:59; 10 N McLennan (I’ness) 33;10; 11 J Gruppen 33:23; 12 H Maridal 33:23; 13 J Holterman 34:07; 14 H Townsend (Leeds) 34:17; 15 R Hodgkinson Liv) 34:48; 16 K Olding (Army) 35:23; 17 S Wood (Sale) 35:41; 18 A :Pearce (Steel) 35:46; 19 F O’Hare (Liv) 35:49; 20 A Howarth (Vale R) 35:50 1 R Barcia-Cabrera (Sheff Tri) 38:17 1 V Wright North M) 37:14 1 J Wray (S’bach) 47:51 1 J Westlake (Craw) 66:34; 2 L Vanderlinden (BEL) 67:56; 3 D Eckersley (Ryde) 68:25; 4 T Roberts (Meir’d) 68:42; 5 B Stephenson (Dart, M40) 69:20; 7 J Horman (Liv, M40) 70:34; 8 B Kruze (Strat, M40) 70:43; 9 C Hannan (ST Hel) 70:55; 10 S Campbell Liv) 70:56 1 R Coen (Wilm) 73:26 1 S Shaw (ESM) 74:25 1 S Mugglestone (Bide) 74:41 1 A Marshall (Mid M) 78:40 1 E Baker (W40) 74:50; 2 E McLeod (Roth) 78:17; 3 J Briscoe (Wake, W45) 79:23; 4 R Vicker (Col H) 79:28; 5 E Hilliar (Poole) 80:04; 6 D Morris (W40) 80:43; 7 S Delderfield (VoA, W40) 80:49; 8 L Cooper (Shrews) 81:00; 9 J Donaldson (A’deen) 81:31; 10 R O’Kill (S’end) 82:08 4 R Cole (Linc W) 83:29 2 T Anderson (Win) 83:08; 3 A Halton-Hanley (Chipp) 83:12 1 J Cook (100 Mara) 84:38; 2 T Hinxman (Glouc) 85:47; 3 J Fairburn (Chelt) 87:25; 4 E Hines (Swin) 88:19 1 T Jenkins (P’cawl) 86:11; 2 K Neesam (N Marske) 88:12; 3 K Noyce (And) 91;59 1 F Usher (Linc &D) 90:39; 2 G Richardson (Stock) 98:56; 3 M Norman (Run4U) 1:40:03 1 L Hembury (Tring) 1:40:39; 2 B Strevens (Mansf) 1:43:46; 3 N Mowatt (Wilm) 1:44;45 1 J MacDonald (Ton) 32:14 1 M Porter (Exe U) 36:40 1 N Collins (Ashf, M45) 33:36 1 R Tomlinson (M&M) 36:11 1 L Smith (Hallam) 35:13 The day after the site hosted the there was more relay action over the same 5km lap, but this time predominately for seniors.

        "content": "University of Delhi on Tuesday launched a portal for admission to 71,000 undergraduate seats for the academic session 2024-25. Candidates can register for DU CSAS UG 2024 online at the website. There are a total of 79 UG programmes in 69 colleges of DU with 71,000 seats. Admissions will be based on the merit score in the Common University Entrance Test for undergraduate programmes (CUET-UG) conducted by the National Testing Agency. “Admission to the DU UG courses for the academic session 2024-25 will be conducted through DU CSAS portal 2024,” DU Dean Admission Haneet Gandhi said in a press conference. The process includes applying for the University of Delhi, filling in the course and college preference and then the seats will be allocated. The portal was also launched for UG admissions to the School of Open Learning (SOL) and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB). Candidates will be required to pay the DU CSAS UG 2024 registration fee. Admission to the University of Delhi through CUET will commence after the declaration of results. Till 2021, admissions to DU undergraduate courses were done based on cutoff marks premised on Class 12 board exam scores. The next stage of admissions will commence after the CUET results when candidates need to specify their preferred course-college combination. “The order of the programme and college combination selected then will become the priority list, which will determine allotments,” Haneet Gandhi said. DU officials said once a seat is allocated in a particular round, the candidate must “accept” the allocated seat before the last date for the given allocation round, with inactivity or inaction to be taken as non-acceptance to the allocated seat",

Восемь сотрудников будут переведены в Соединенные Штаты, в центр компании в Сан-Франциско. Об этом издание Calcalistech. Перед волной сокращений в Bright Machines работало около 200 человек в Израиле, США и Мексике. Генеральный директор и основатель компании Лиор Сьюзан сообщил, что после шести лет руководство приняло непростое решение — закрыть центр разработки в Израиле. Таким образом компания хочет повысить эффективность и скорость своей работы. \"Мы робототехническая компания и наши клиенты находятся за рубежом, и эта релокация позволит нам работать ближе к ним. Этот стратегический поворот позволит Bright Machines продолжать быть инновационной и реализовывать наше видение о преобразовании мирового производства\", — отметил основатель предприятия.

        "content": "Launching a scathing attack on Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his remark that the Bhagwant Mann government will fall after June 4, Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that the BJP thinks as they broke Shiv Sena, NCP, they can break Punjabis too but they will fail. Addressing a rally here today, Kejriwal said, “They are running dictatorship in the entire country. Amit Shah said in Ludhiana that after June 4, our government will fall and Bhagwant Mann will not remain the CM. He is openly threatening the Punjab. They think that just as they broke Shiv Sena and NCP, they will break Punjabis too. Do not threaten Punjab, it will harm you.” “They (BJP) have withheld Rs 9,000 crore of Punjab’s rights. Rs 5,500 crore is from the Rural Development Fund through which roads were to be built in villages. The money from the National Health Commission was to be used to build Mohalla Clinic. This is hooliganism. Politics should happen during elections,” Kejriwal added. Further, the AAP chief said that in the previous governments, traders and industries were fleeing from the state while in AAP’s 2-year tenure, leaving Punjab has topped. “When other parties were in power two years ago, traders and industries were fleeing Punjab. But now leaving Punjab has stopped. Our effort is to bring back those who have left, to give an opportunity to those who are here to build their businesses and to bring foreign investment into Punjab. In the last 2 years, investment of about Rs 56,000 crore has started in Punjab, which will employ about 3 lakh youth. If such a huge investment is coming, then it means the situation has improved,” Arvind Kejriwal added. He further urged the people to vote for AAP in the Lok Sabha election and make it win all 13 seats in the state. “If we have power at the Centre, we will be able to fight on the issues of the states. Today I request you to give 13 seats of Punjab so that your rights can be brought from the Centre,” he said",

        "content": "HONG KONG, May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Futu Holdings (NASDAQ: FUTU ) Limited (Futu or the Company) (Nasdaq: FUTU), a leading tech-driven online brokerage and wealth management platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights Total number of paying clients 1 increased 23.5% year-over-year to 1,887,270 as of March 31, 2024. Total number of registered clients 2 increased 15.4% year-over-year to 3,812,326 as of March 31, 2024. Total number of users 3 increased 12.3% year-over-year to 22.5 million as of March 31, 2024. Total client assets increased 11.2% year-over-year to HK$517.9 billion as of March 31, 2024. Daily average client assets were HK$480.0 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 6.0% from the same period in 2023. Total trading volume in the first quarter of 2024 increased by 9.5% year-over-year to HK$1.3 trillion, in which trading volume for U.S. stocks was HK$1.0 trillion, trading volume for Hong Kong stocks was HK$280.4 billion, and trading volume for stocks under the Stock Connect was HK$9.5 billion. Daily average revenue trades (DARTs) 4 in the first quarter of 2024 increased 7.0% year-over-year to 549,854. Margin financing and securities lending balance increased 8.9% year-over-year to HK$37.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Total revenues increased 3.7% year-over-year to HK$2,592.5 million (US$331.3 million). Total gross profit decreased 3.9% year-over-year to HK$2,122.2 million (US$271.2 million). Net income decreased 13.1% year-over-year to HK$1,035.1 million (US$132.3 million). Non-GAAP adjusted net income 5 decreased 11.6% year-over-year to HK$1,121.1 million (US$143.3 million). Mr. Leaf Hua Li, Futu's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, New paying clients jumped by 330.8% year-over-year to 177 thousand, the third highest quarterly growth in history, thanks to strong market performance and solid execution in new markets. This paying client growth represented over 50% of the full-year guidance we gave out during the last earnings call. We ended the first quarter with around 1.9 million paying clients, up 23.5% year-over-year and 10.4% quarter-over-quarter. Given the year-to-date momentum, we would like to raise our full-year new paying client guidance to 400 thousand for now. In the first quarter, new paying clients from Hong Kong and Singapore both recorded strong double-digit growth sequentially, but their total contribution to overall client growth dipped to around one-third given triple-digit sequential new paying client growth in other markets. Our recent launch in Malaysia far exceeded our expectations. With industry-leading product experience and high brand recognition thanks to our presence in Singapore, we attracted over 100,000 registered clients within six weeks of brokerage business launch and became the most downloaded financial app in Malaysia. Though growth decelerated in the second quarter, we still expect robust paying client addition in Malaysia for the rest of the year. In Japan, we continued to streamline the account opening process, refine product experience and launch targeted marketing initiatives. As a result, both new paying clients and average client assets increased meaningfully. Despite rapid client base expansion, our quarterly paying client retention rate remained above 98%. While market depreciation of several technology names posted negative impact on client holdings, we saw exceptionally strong net asset inflow across all markets during the quarter, especially in March, when market sentiments in Hong Kong improved. Total client assets were HK$517.9 billion, up 11.2% year-over-year and 6.7% quarter-over-quarter. In Singapore, total client assets and average client assets recorded 25% and 15% sequential growth, respectively, driven by robust net asset inflow into equities and cash management products. Total trading volume increased by 40.0% quarter-over-quarter to HK$1.3 trillion. As clients chased the Hong Kong market rally, Hong Kong stock trading volume rebounded 18.0% sequentially to HK$280.4 billion. Clients showed heightened interests in technology and high-dividend names as well as leveraged and inverse ETFs. The frenzy around crypto and AI-themed stocks drove a 48.1% sequential surge in U.S. trading volume to HK$1.0 trillion. Margin financing and securities lending balance increased by 13.7% sequentially to an all-time high of HK$37.6 billion. Total client assets in wealth management were HK$64.0 billion, up 72.8% year-over-year and 11.1% quarter-over-quarter. Driven by strong demand for U.S. treasury bills, bond holdings increased by 21.3% sequentially. In Singapore, wealth management asset balance grew by 37.1% quarter-over-quarter as money market funds continued to gain traction. We had 430 IPO distribution and IR clients, up 21.8% year-over-year. As of quarter end, over 1,200 companies have set up enterprise accounts in our social community to interact with retail investors. First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues were HK$2,592.5 million (US$331.3 million), an increase of 3.7% from HK$2,499.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. Brokerage commission and handling charge income was HK$1,082.1 million (US$138.3 million), an increase of 0.3% from the first quarter of 2023. Brokerage income grew at a slower pace than trading volume due to a decrease in blended commission rate from 8.8bps to 8.1bps. Interest income was HK$1,354.2 million (US$173.0 million), an increase of 4.6% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by higher margin financing income due to an increase in daily average margin balance and higher interest income from bank deposits. Other income was HK$156.2 million (US$20.0 million), an increase of 23.7% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher fund distribution service income. Costs Total costs were HK$470.2 million (US$60.1 million), an increase of 61.7% from HK$290.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Brokerage commission and handling charge expenses were HK$60.3 million (US$7.7 million), a decrease of 16.5% from the first quarter of 2023. Brokerage expenses didn't move in tandem with brokerage income mainly due to cost savings from our U.S. self-clearing business. Interest expenses were HK$312.8 million (US$40.0 million), an increase of 139.1% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher expenses associated with our securities borrowing and lending business. Processing and servicing costs were HK$97.1 million (US$12.4 million), an increase of 10.7% from the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher cloud service and data transmission fees for new markets. Gross Profit Total gross profit was HK$2,122.2 million (US$271.2 million), a decrease of 3.9% from HK$2,209.0 million in the first quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 81.9%, as compared to 88.4% in the first quarter of 2023. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were HK$929.5 million (US$118.8 million), an increase of 15.6% from HK$804.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses were HK$335.5 million (US$42.9 million), a decrease of 5.5% from the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was due to stricter cost control. Selling and marketing expenses were HK$292.7 million (US$37.4 million), an increase of 107.1% from HK$141.3 million in the first quarter of 2023. This was driven by a 330.8% year-over-year increase in net new paying clients, offset by lower client acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses were HK$301.3 million (US$38.5 million), a decrease of 2.1% from the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower professional service fees. Income from Operations Income from operations decreased by 15.1% to HK$1,192.7 million (US$152.4 million) from HK$1,405.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, mostly due to higher marketing expenses. Operating margin declined to 46.0% from 56.2% in the first quarter of 2023. Net Income Net income decreased by 13.1% to HK$1,035.1 million (US$132.3 million) from HK$1,191.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net income margin for the first quarter of 2024 declined to 39.9% from 47.7% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income decreased by 11.6% to HK$1,121.1 million (US$143.3 million) from the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is defined as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. For further information, see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the bottom of this press release. Net Income per ADS Basic net income per American Depositary Share (ADS) was HK$7.53 (US$0.96), compared with HK$8.54 in the first quarter of 2023. Diluted net income per ADS was HK$7.46 (US$0.95), compared with HK$8.44 in the first quarter of 2023. Each ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares.

About Futu Holdings Limited Futu Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: FUTU) is an advanced technology company transforming the investing experience by offering fully digitalized financial services. Through its proprietary digital platforms, Futubull and moomoo, the Company provides a full range of investment services, including trade execution and clearing, margin financing and securities lending, and wealth management. The Company has embedded social media tools to create a network centered around its users and provide connectivity to users, investors, companies, analysts, media and key opinion leaders. The Company also provides corporate services, including IPO distribution, investor relations and ESOP solution services. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines non-GAAP adjusted net income as net income excluding share-based compensation expenses. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP adjusted net income enables the management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of share-based compensation expenses, which are non-cash charges. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP adjusted net income is that it does not reflect all items of expense that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP adjusted net income. Further, the non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. For more information on this non-GAAP financial measure, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP and GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.

        "content": "On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank updated its outlook on Givaudan SA (GIVN:SW) (OTC: GVDNY) shares, a leading company in the flavor and fragrance industry. The bank raised its price target on the company's shares to CHF 4,350 from the previous CHF 4,000, while maintaining a Hold rating. The adjustment follows a model update that takes into account an anticipated increase in sales growth and profit margins. Deutsche Bank's revised model predicts a rise in Givaudan's earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for the years 2024-2026 by 4-6%. This is due to expectations of higher organic sales growth, now forecasted at 8.5% for the year 2024, up from the previous estimate of 7.7%. Deutsche Bank also expects a reduced negative impact from foreign exchange rates, adjusting the estimate to a 2% detriment compared to the former 4.2% figure. Additionally, the bank has increased its margin assumptions for Givaudan by an average of 30 basis points over the next three years. This change reflects the potential benefits of cost-cutting measures and an improvement in input costs. The updated target price also includes the effects of rolling forward the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis used to evaluate the company's value. The DCF is a valuation method that projects future cash flows and discounts them back to the present value. Givaudan, headquartered in Switzerland, is known for its creation of flavors and fragrances used in a wide array of consumer products. The updated financial forecasts and price target reflect Deutsche Bank's analysis of the company's financial prospects and market position.

        "content": "Fußball: Die Entscheidungen am letzten Spieltag Am Mittwoch und Donnerstag findet von der Verbandsliga Nord abwärts der letzte Spieltag der Fußball-Saison 23/24 statt. Einige Entscheidungen sind noch immer offen. Hersfeld-Rotenburg – Der vorletzte Spieltag hat am Wochenende in einigen Ligen für Klarheit gesorgt. In der Gruppenliga Fulda hat sich Aufsteiger SG Neuenstein den Klassenerhalt gesichert, ohne in die Relegation zu müssen. Die FSG Bebra kam in der Kreisoberliga gegen Absteiger Ludwigsau kampflos zu Punkten und somit am Sonntag zu einer „Sofa-Meisterschaft“ – wenngleich verdient. Bebra spielt also in der kommenden Saison ebenso wie Neuenstein und der ESV Hönebach in der Gruppenliga. In der Kreisliga A Hünfeld-Hersfeld hat die Reserve der SG Eiterfeld/Leimbach ihr Meisterstück gemacht und steigt in die Kreisoberliga Nord auf. Wo es am Mittwoch und Donnerstag noch spannend wird, haben wir im Folgenden zusammengestellt. Kreisoberliga Nord Abstiegsduell in Wehrda: Am Mittwoch (19 Uhr) geht es zwischen dem Tabellenvorletzten SG Haunetal und dem Drittletzten SG Werratal um den Klassenerhalt. Haunetal (26 Punkte) muss gewinnen, um die Relegation zu erreichen. Werratal (28) braucht einen Zähler, um nicht doch noch direkt abzusteigen. Eine ausführliche Vorschau zu diesem „Abstiegs-Endspiel“ lesen Sie in unserer Mittwoch-Ausgabe. Kreisliga A1 Spannender Zweikampf um Tabellenplatz zwei zwischen Heinebach/Osterbach und Rotenburg/Lispenhausen. Der Tabellenzweite Heinebach/Osterbach (64 Punkter) muss bei Meister Cornberg/Rockensüß gewinnen, falls Verfolger Rotenburg (63) sein Heimspiel gegen Haselgrund/Breitenbach gewinnen sollte. Beide Begegnungen werden am Donnerstag, 15 Uhr, angepfiffen. Der Zweite spielt in der Relegation um den Aufstieg in die Kreisoberliga. Kreisliga A2 Der SV Wölf braucht gegen Großenbach im Heimspiel noch einen Punkt, um wie in der vergangenen Saison die Aufstiegs-Relegation festzuzurren. Schenklengsfeld/Rotensee/Wippershain muss zeitgleich in Mackenzell gewinnen und auf einen Wölfer Ausrutscher hoffen. Beide Partien beginnen am Donnerstag um 15 Uhr. Weil der direkte Vergleich bei Punktgleichheit ebenfalls ausgeglichen wäre, würde in diesem Fall das Torverhältnis entscheiden. Hier ist Wölf um 15 Treffer im Vorteil. Kreisliga B2 Die Reserve des VfL Philippsthal ist Tabellenführer (65 Punkte), kann aber im Fall der Meisterschaft nicht aufsteigen, weil die eigene erste Mannschaft in der A-Liga spielt. Zweiter ist die FSG Hohenroda II (64), die somit beste Chancen auf den Aufstieg besitzt. Drei Punkte beträgt der Vorsprung auf den Dritten FSG Jossatal II und auch der direkte Vergleich sowie das Torverhältnis sprechen für Hohenroda. Die FSG spielt am Mittwoch (19 Uhr) in Asbach gegen die zweite Mannschaft der SG Hessen/SVA/SpVgg. Jossatal tritt zeitgleich bei Heenes/Kalkobes II in Kalkobes an. Der voraussichtliche Meister Philippsthal II hat Sorga/Kathus im Reserveduell zu Gast.",

Spre exemplu, atunci când vorbim de aplicații software, pentru a face performanță este nevoie de ceea ce numim noi continuous development. Continuous development înseamnă că ai făcut o soluție și o îmbunătățești în permanență, în așa fel încât să rămână la același standard de securitate, să rămână la aceleași standarde de utilizabilitate. Ei bine, legea achizițiilor publice din România nu permite asta. Când vorbim despre software nu trebuie să livrăm un soft și după să ne luăm mâinile de pe el, trebuie ca acel soft să fie întreținut în permanență, trebuie să fie updatat în permanență, cu ultimele tehnologii și rezolvate problemele de vulnerabilitate, care se descoperă în tehnologiile care sunt componente din acea soluție soft”. Scop: servicii publice digitalizate Alexandru Panait este cercetător în securitatea cibernetică și are un scop în sine: descentralizarea serviciilor publice cu ajutorul noilor tehnologii. Platforma pe care a creat-o a digitalizat toate cele 3150 de primării din România. Cetăținii au acces la foarte multe date, văd cum se cheltuie banii publici, dar, mai important, pot depune și obține documente fără să mai stea la cozile de la ghișee. Alexandru Panait , expert inovare digitală: „ Noi, din mediul privat, ne permitem să avem o strategie eficientă ca să putem să performăm în piață. Administrația publică nu are nevoie neapărat de așa ceva, pentru că primăria nu dispare de acolo dacă nu își face treaba și este pe deficit bugetar. Și cred că cel mai important lucru este ca mediul privat din România să poată să ajute administrațiile publice și administrațiile publice să înțeleagă că există la noi în România există foarte multe companii cu competențe digitale ridicate în România și administrația publică ar trebui să înceapă să folosească aceste competențe”.

Alexandru Panait , expert inovare digitală: „ Din păcate, discuțiile pe care le-am inițiat eu a fost mult mai multe decât cele care au fost inițiate de statul român cu compania noastră și noi ne bazăm pe faptul că cetățeanul va vedea cât de utilă este soluția noastră și automat acesta va solicita administrațiilor publice să se modernizeze. Și credem că democrația încă poate fi eficientă și în România și cu siguranță doar digitalizarea ne poate aduce la normalitate înapoi” . Breșele digitalizării românești România digitalizată este încă departe de realitate, momentan ne confruntăm cu vulnerabilitățile, una dintre ele recent descoperită chiar pe siteul guvernului. Alexandru Panait , expert inovare digitală: „ Această vulnerabilitate permite unui atacator ca să impresioneze orice persoană din Guvernul României. Ceea ce, vă dați seama, este extrem de grav pentru un stat, pentru că dacă cineva trimite în numele statului român un document către Bruxelles sau către alte țări, poate să creeze niște conflicte foarte mari, niște dezechilibre” . Digitalizarea, normalitatea secolui XXI Ne păstrăm speranța că vom ajunge la o normalitate digitală și în România, așa cum vedem în tot mai multe state ale Uniunii Europene. Până atunci însă, ne putem folosi votul pe data de 9 iunie. Alexandru Panait , expert inovare digitală: „ Pot să zic că se văd doar promisiunile. În societatea civilă, în momentul de față așteptăm cloudul guvernamental. Așteptăm ca toate finanțările care au fost date deja spre instituțiile publice să apară și să ne schimbe viața. Problema cea mai mare, din punctul meu de vedere, este că totul este descentralizat, spre exemplu pe componenta C10 din PNDR s-au dați bani către instituțiile publice, iar acestea au putut să facă ce și-au dorit cu banii respectivi. În loc să existe o strategie centrală, de unde să pornească toată digitalizarea administrației publice, banii sunt împrăștiați efectiv haotic și se așteaptă ca noi să avem servicii de calitate pentru cetățeni”.",

        "description": "The pension reform drive is poised to run off the rails with no one commanding the steering wheel. The presidential office, the governing People Power Party (PPP) and the majority Democratic Party (DP) are singing different tunes to fan public distrust in the system. After outgoing National Assembly speaker Kim Jin-pyo proposed to fix the premium rate and income replacement rate during the current 21st National Assembly, which expires on May 29, to let the next legislature deal with the remaining structural reform, the presidential office and the PPP refused it. Earlier, DP leader Lee Jae-myung proposed a meeting with President Yoon Suk Yeol to discuss the issue, and then offered to accept the PPP’s outline.Pension reform is a president’s responsibility. Leaders staked their political life on reforming their national pension system. But in Korea, the opposition leader came forward while the president stayed on the sidelines. Lee reluctantly agreed on the need for pension reform during a presidential TV debate in 2022, and has never made any proposals since. Then he suddenly pushes for the reform with just a few days left before the current legislative term ends. And yet, one cannot just dismiss his proposal.President Yoon repeatedly stressed the need for the legislature to pass the pension reform bill in the next National Assembly. The government and the PPP are faithfully following Yoon’s instructions. The president persistently stressed the importance of pension reform, but his administration was sitting on its hands until the last minute. Although the rival parties nearly reached a bipartisan agreement on the first reform in 17 years, the president wants to deal with it in the next National Assembly without clear grounds.The presidential office and the PPP claim that the reform will be incomplete without structural overhaul, but they have never come up with an outline on structural reform, nor clear guidelines on changing the premium and income replacement rates. Do they really think such a package reform is possible?The governing front must tackle the reform first in the upcoming legislature. First of all, it must fix its position on how to form a special committee, how to adjust the pension and income replacement rates and how to implement the scheme. It must also decide if it will merge the scheme with the basic pension and other social benefit programs, or if it will adopt macroeconomic indexation or an automatic adjustment mechanism to reflect structural factors, such as an aging population, to adjust pension benefits. If government does not hurry up, the reform drive will face a stalemate due to the 2026 local elections and 2027 presidential election. The pension is gathering a deficit of 50 trillion won ($37 billion) a year. Yoon must meet Lee to hasten the process. 여당·대통령실, 22대 국회 연금개혁 즉각처리 약속해야 모수개혁 근접에도 거부 이유 납득 안 돼 개원 직후 개혁 일정·방안 분명히 제시를 연금개혁을 둘러싼 혼란이 점입가경이다. 여야, 대통령실이 나서 연일 자신의 주장을 강변한다. 이런 혼란이 연금개혁에 결코 이로울 게 없다. 제도불신을 초래하고 혐오감만 심화시킬 것 같아 매우 걱정스럽다. 어제만 해도 김진표 국회의장이 \"21대 국회에서 모수개혁(보험료·소득대체율 조정) 하고 22대에서 구조개혁을 하자\"고 제안하자 대통령실 관계자, 국민의힘 추경호 원내대표가 나서 \"22대 국회에서 하자\"고 거부했다. 이에 앞서 이재명 더불어민주당 대표는 지난 23일 '연금개혁 영수회담'을 제안하더니 24, 25일 연달아 양보안을 내고 압박했다. 연금개혁은 대통령의 어젠다다. 선진국 지도자도 정권을 내줄 각오로 개혁을 추진했다. 그런데 야당대표가 나서고, 윤석열대통령은 발을 빼는 보기 드문 상황이 이어진다. 이대표는 2022년 대선 토론회에서 연금개혁에 마지못해 동의했다. 이후에도 심도있는 논의나 제안을 거의 안했다. 그러다 21대 국회임기 끄트머리에 갑자기 밀어붙이니 진정성을 의심받을 만하다. 그렇다고 해도 야당대표가 연금개혁에 나서고 여당안을 받아들이겠다는 건 의미가 결코 작지 않다. 윤대통령은 취임 2주년 기자회견과 그 직전 영수회담에서 \"22대 국회 처리\"라고 못박았다. 그러니 정부·여당은 이 기준에 맞춰 그만 얼어붙어 버렸다. 윤대통령은 취임 초부터 연금개혁을 강조해왔다. 그런데 지난해 10월 제5차 국민연금 재정계산 때 정부안을 내지 않았다. 총선 눈치보기로 받아들여졌다. 취임 2주년 기자회견에선 6000쪽, 24개 시나리오의 자료를 국회에 제출한 게 공약이행이라는 납득힘든 논리를 폈다. 여야가 17년 만에 합의에 거의 근접했는데도 석연치 않은 이유로 '22대 처리'로 넘겨버렸다. 여당과 대통령실은 \"구조개혁을 같이 해야 한다\"고 주장한다. 모수개혁도 안하면서 더 큰 걸 얘기한다. 지금까지 구조개혁의 밑그림을 제대로 내놓은 적도 없다. 그러다 이제야 구조개혁을 들고나오니 어안이 벙벙할 따름이다. 한방에 개혁하자는 그게 과연 가능할까. 여당과 대통령실이 진정 22대 국회 처리를 주장한다면 개원 직후 어떤 이슈보다 먼저 다뤄야 한다. 연금특위 구성, 모수개혁, 구조개혁으로 이어지는 일정과 방법, 실행계획을 제시해야 한다. 구조개혁 그림도 내놔야 한다. 기초연금과의 관계도 조정 선에서 할 건지, 둘을 통합할지 기초생활보장제까지 합할 건지, 성장률 등 경제지표에 따른 연금액 자동조정장치를 도입할 건지 분명히 해야 한다. 서두르지 않으면 2026년 지방선거, 2027년 대선에 막혀 또 5년을 허비한다. 한해 50조원씩의 누적적자를 더는 방치해선 안된다. 필요하면 언제든지 '원포인트 영수회담'을 열겠다고도 약속하라.",

Quelle: LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX Skandalöse Affären, heimliche Liebschaften und die Suche nach dem Glück: Zum dritten Mal entführt „Bridgerton“ sein Publikum in die fiktive Welt der Londoner High Society des 19. Jahrhunderts. Wann es losgeht und worum es in der neuen Staffel geht. London, frühes 19. Jahrhundert. Acht junge Geschwister der Familie Bridgerton wollen sich ihren Platz in der High Society sichern. Während der Ballsaison suchen die jungen Damen und Herren der Oberschicht nach passenden Ehepartnern. Dabei spielen die Meinung der Königin und der geheimnisvollen Klatschkolumnistin Lady Whistledown eine wichtige Rolle. „Bridgerton“: Wann startet die dritte Staffel? Die acht Folgen umfassende dritte Staffel von „Bridgerton“ wird in zwei Teilen veröffentlicht. Der erste Teil erscheint am 16. Mai 2024 auf Netflix. Die restlichen vier Folgen erscheinen am 13. Juni 2024 . Wie schon in den ersten beiden Staffeln wird auch in der nun erscheinenden dritten eine neue Geschichte erzählt. „Bridgerton“: Trailer und Teaser zu Staffel drei Der aktuellste Trailer ging am Donnerstag, den 11. April online. Darin sind Penelope und Colin zu sehen, die im Laufe der neuen Staffel (vermutlich) noch zueinanderfinden. Nicht verraten wird hingegen, ob Colin ihrem Geheimnis auf die Schliche kommt und herausfindet, dass Penelope die mysteriöse Lady Whistledown ist. Die Zuschauer und Zuschauerinnen haben dies bereits zum Finale von Staffel eins erfahren. „Bridgerton“: Was in Staffel eins und Staffel zwei passiert ist Achtung, Spoiler! Im Folgenden fassen wir zusammen, was in den bisherigen Staffeln passiert ist – für einen schnellen Einstieg in die neue Staffel. Staffel 1 Staffel eins dreht sich um die Debütantin Daphne Bridgerton, die verheiratet werden soll. Sie selbst geht, um einer ungewollten Ehe zu entgehen, einen geheimen Pakt mit dem Herzog von Hastings Simon Bassett ein: Daphne will so ihren zukünftigen Traummann auf sich aufmerksam machen, während Simon sich andere Anwärterinnen vom Leib halten will. Es kommt, wie es kommen muss: Beide verlieben sich während dieses Schauspiels schließlich ungewollt ineinander. Nach vielen Komplikationen und Problemen gibt es für die beiden ein Happy End. Staffel zwei In Staffel zwei geht es um die Liebesgeschichte zwischen Lord Anthony Bridgerton und Kate Sharma. Anthony ist auf der Suche nach einer geeigneten Debütantin, um seinen Familiennamen aufrechtzuerhalten, hat dabei jedoch immer wieder Pech – bis die beiden Schwestern Kate und Edwina aus Indien eintreffen. Anthony macht Edwina Avancen, Kate erkennt dabei jedoch, dass der Lord keinen Wert auf eine Heirat aus Liebe legt. Überzeugt, ihre Schwester vor diesem Schicksal zu bewahren, versucht sie die Verbindung zu verhindern. Immer wieder kommt es daraufhin zu Streitereien und Wortgefechten, die Kate und Anthony jedoch überraschenderweise näher zusammenbringen. In der finalen Folge gesteht Anthony Kate seine Liebe und sie willigt ein, ihn zu heiraten. Besetzung von „Bridgerton“: Die wichtigsten Charaktere und ihre Schauspieler In „Bridgerton“ treten eine Menge Charaktere auf. Hier ein Überblick über die wichtigsten Figuren, die in der Serie wiederkehrend vorkommen. Familie Bridgerton Die namensgebende Familie steht im Mittelpunkt der Geschichte und gehört zur Oberklasse des fiktiven Regency-Englands zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts. Neben den Eltern Lady Violet und Lord Edmund zählen acht Kinder. Familie Featherington Eine wichtige Familie sind die Featheringtons, an deren Anfang Lady Portia steht. Sie will ihre drei Töchter möglichst einflussreich verheiraten. Weitere wichtige Charaktere in „Bridgerton“: „Bridgerton“-Bücher: Darauf basiert die Serie Die beliebte Netflix-Adaption beruht auf den Büchern der US-amerikanischen Autorin Julia Quinn. Im Allgemeinen folgt die Serie der Handlung in den Romanvorlagen, hält sich aber nicht immer strikt daran. So basiert Staffel eins auf dem ersten Band, „Bridgerton – Der Duke und ich“, Staffel zwei basiert auf dem zweiten Band, „Wie bezaubert man einen Viscount?“, und Staffel drei orientiert sich an Band vier, „Penelopes pikantes Geheimnis“. Die „Bridgerton“-Bücher umfassen insgesamt acht Bände. In der Rokesby-Reihe wird außerdem die Vorgeschichte zu den Bridgertons erzählt. Die „Bridgerton“-Romane in der Übersicht: --- „Bridgerton“: Worum geht es in Staffel drei? Zum Ende von Staffel eins erfahren Zuschauerinnen und Zuschauer Penelopes geheime Identität. Während die mysteriöse Klatschkolumnistin in Staffel eins und zwei vor allem für die Enthüllung pikanter Geheimnisse zuständig ist, wird Penelope in Staffel drei selbst im Fokus stehen. Ihre Beziehung zu Colin Bridgerton ist das zentrale Thema der neuen Staffel. Bridgerton. Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington in episode 201 of Bridgerton. Cr.

        "content": "Ministrul Justiției din Ucraina, Denis Maliuska, a declarat la televiziunea națională, pe 27 mai, că deținuții eliberați din închisoare conform unei noi legi, vor servi în unități separate ale armatei ucrainene. Parlamentul Ucrainei a adoptat în luna mai un proiect de lege care le permite celor condamnați sub anumite acuzații să servească în Forțele Armate, deschizând calea pentru mobilizarea voluntară a prizonierilor. Președintele Volodimir Zelenski a semnat proiectul de lege pe 17 mai . Maliuska a declarat la începutul lunii mai că Ucraina și-ar putea umple rândurile cu până la 20.000 de condamnați , într-o mișcare care ar ajuta, de asemenea, la reducerea supraaglomerării în închisorile ucrainene. Unitățile cu foști prizonieri vor fi înființate pentru operațiuni de asalt și nu vor implica alt personal militar, a spus Maliuska, informează The Kyiv Independent . Ministrul a adăugat, de asemenea, informații conform cărora comandamentul ucrainean ar putea amesteca în viitor foști prizonieri cu alte unități militare, având în vedere performanța acestora pe câmpul de luptă. Cel puțin 613 deținuți au fost eliberați datorită noii legi de conscripție din 27 mai, potrivit ministrului Justiției Maliuska. Noii veniți urmează, în prezent, o pregătire care va dura „cel puțin câteva luni”, a mai spus acesta. Au fost depuse până acum 4.300 de cereri și sunt în curs de examinare majoritatea, potrivit Ministerului Justiției. Cei eliberați vor fi supravegheați de unitățile militare în care se înrolează și nu pot părăsi unitățile fără permisiunea comandanților lor. Conform noilor reguli, lista deținuților cărora li s-a permis să se înroleze nu îi include pe cei condamnaţi pentru omor premeditat, violenţă sexuală, trafic şi producţie de droguri sau crime împotriva securităţii naţionale. Pe baza sugestiilor comisiei parlamentare anticorupție, măsura va exclude, de asemenea, parlamentarii și oficialii de vârf închiși pentru corupție. Editor : C.S.",

        "content": "Nu vänder det: Matpriserna sjunker! Samtidigt visar statistik från i fjol hur vårt köpbeteende har förändrats. Vi äter mindre ekologiskt och tröstäter mer. En lättnad i hushållens ekonomi är i sikte, uppger Naturresursintitutet Luke . Matpriserna började gå nedåt i februari och fortsätter i samma riktning. Särskilt mot slutet av året förutspås priserna sjunka. ”Enligt prognoserna kommer konsumentpriserna på livsmedel och alkoholfria drycker minska i medeltal 2–3 procent”, säger forskningschefen och specialforskaren Hanna Karikallio i ett pressmeddelande. Redan nu syns en nedgång i spannmålspriserna, men priserna är ändå 25–50 procent högre än vad de var före de senaste 2 åren av pristurbulens. Det syns också en prissänkning på över 2 procent för mjök- och köttprodukter. De här produktpriserna steg mest Matpriserna steg med över 15 procent i början av fjolåret, men prisstigningen jämnade ut sig under året. I medeltal steg matpriserna och priserna på alkoholfria drycker med 9,2 procent i fjol. Under de två senaste åren har matpriserna stigit med en femtedel. De här produkternas priser steg mest i fjol (2023): Också exempelvis kex, knäckebröd och pizza blev 20 procent dyrare. Den enda produkten som blev billigare i fjol var kaffet, som blev 4,7 procent billigare. Så här har priserna påverkat vårt val av mat Hushållens svagare köpkraft har satt matkedjan på prov och förändrat vårt sätt att äta. Vi har ätit något mindre kött och valt billigare kött såsom fjäderfäkött framför nötkött. Mindre fisk har gått åt, vilket kan bero på att priset på fisk steg med 10 procent i fjol. Vi har däremot ätit mer ägg än tidigare. I fjol åt finländarna i medeltal 199 ägg per person. Vi drack mindre mjölk i fjol, men kom ändå upp till 89 liter mjölk per person. Det är en minskning på närmare 4 procent från året innan. Yoghurt, kvarg och liknande produkter gick åt mer i fjol. Också ostkonsumtionen ökade: Vi åt ett halvt kilogram ost mer per person i fjol, totalt 26 kilogram per person. Mer onyttigt, mindre vegetariskt För en kategori syns en ökning i konsumtionen, trots att maten blivit dyrare. Det gäller onyttigheter, eller tröstmat som Luke kallar det. Vi har ätit mer chips, godis och glass, samtidigt som vi ätit mindre frukt och grönt, vegetariskt och ekologiskt i och med att de produkterna blivit dyrare. Priset på chips har stigit med 15 procent, men trots det har försäljningen ökat med 7 procent. Försäljningen av bakverk, socker, pizza och salta piroger har också ökat. Experterna konstaterar att vi drar oss allt mer till lätta och snabba matlösningar, vilket innebär ökad försäljning av färdigmat och fryst mat. Du kan läsa hela rapporten från Luke här .",

Bugünkü toplantımızı takip eden vatandaşlarımıza en halisane selamlarımı iletiyorum. Türk milleti ahlak ve adaleti hem de sanat ve kültürü eklemlemiştir. Fetihler kuşağı cihanı sarmış ve sarmalamıştır. Çağlardan biri kapanırken diğerinin kapısı açılmıştır. İstanbul, 571 yıl önce zincirlerinden kurtulmuş, sevdalısı Türk milleti ile kavuşmuştur. Zulmün zilletin ve eziyetin kalesi Bizans, Fatih'in mücahitliği ile yıkılıp gitmiştir. Fethimizin emanetleri zayi edilemeyecektir. Bizans heveslerini İstanbul üzerinde dolaştırmayı düşünen, gizli proje hazırlayan iç ve dış operasyon maşalarından İstanbul mutlaka korunacaktır. Ayasofya'nın camiye dönüşmesi ile uykuları kaçanların heveslerini kursaklarında bırakmaya devam edeceğiz. Tarihi eselerin nasıl ki Türk milletinin tescil belgeleriyse fetihler de öyledir, öyle kalacaktır. Bizans hedeflerini kara bulutlar gibi İstanbul'un üzerinde dolaştıran, porje hazırlayan iç ve dış operasyon maşalarından İstanbul mutlaka korunacaktır. \"İSTANBUL KÖTÜ YÖNETİLİYOR\" İstanbul can çekişmektedir. İstanbul'un bugünkü ızdıraplı hali bizi üzmektedir. Ballı börekli Roma seyahatinden sonra İstanbul Büyükşehir Belediye Başkanının müsriflikten bahsetmesine hiç kimse inanmayacaktır. Belediye bütçesini savuruyorlar müsriflik yapıyorlar. Bugünün İBB yönetimi fethin kazanımı İstanbul'u yüzüstü bıraktı. Onlarla hesabımız er geç görülecek. 'Zulüm 1453'te başladı' diyenlerin tamamı Bizans uşaklarıdır. \"NETANYAHU'YU LANETLİYORUM\" Savaş hukukuna bağdaşmayan tablolara her gün yenisi eklenmektedir. Özellikle Refah'a yönelik saldırıların derhal durdurulması istenmiştir. Ancak İsrail buna uymamıştır. Birçok insan acımasızca katledilmiştir. Çadır kampında binlerce masum insan ateş altına alınmıştır. Netanyahu başta olmak üzere tüm İsrail yönetimini lanetliyorum. Hesap vermeleri kaçınılmaz bir sondur. Gazze konusu insanlığın sıcak bir gündemidir. Köklü müdahalelerin tam vaktidir. Ne bekleniyor! Daha ne kadar sabır edilmeli! İsrail'e karşı somut adım atılmalı. Cezalandırıcı, seri, kuvvet kullanıcı önlemler alınmalı. TERÖR ÖRGÜTÜ PKK'DAN SURİYE'DE SEÇİM HAMLESİ ABD Suriye'nin kuzeyinde yeni bir oyun kurmaktadır. Suriye'nin kuzey doğusunda 11 Haziran'da sözde bölgesel seçimler yapılacak. Bu Türkiye'nin bölünmesinde yeni aşama demektir. Bölücü örgütün Rojova adı ile tarif ettiği yerde ABD'nin teröristlerle diyaloğu stratejik önemde gördüğü açıktır. Türkiye Suriye yönetimi ile karşılıklı el ele vererek iş birliği köprüsü inşa ederek terör örgütünün istilasına müsaade edilmemelidir. Askeri operasyonlarla terörizmin kökü kurutulmalıdır. İhanete geçit yoktur. ABD'nin terörizmi politik enstrüman olarak kullanması rezalettir. ABD'nin komşu coğrafyalarda teröre verdiği destek Türkiye'ye aşırı tehdittir. Türkiye sömürge ülkesi ya da ABD'nin 51 eyaleti değildir, olması da mümkün değildir. Şam ile iş birliği ve ortak operasyon yapılmalı. Suriye'deki sözde seçiminin senaristi ABD, figüranları teröristlerdir. Terörizmin kaynağı kurutulmalıdır. ABD, terörle arasına kalın bir çizgi çekmeli. ABD, Afganistan'da yaptığı gibi Suriye ve Irak'tan çekilmelidir. FETÖ'nün ABD'ye yuvalanmış tüm mensupları Türkiye'ye ve Türk adaletine teslim edilmelidir. ABD, özellikle PKK/YPG,PYD ile bağını koparamıyorsa bu teröristleri kendi ülkesine taşıyarak bir terör bölgesi kurması teklifimizdir. Alsınlar tepe tepe kullansınlar, toprak verip sabah akşam pışpışlasınlar.",

        "content": "Jerusalem: Witnesses and survivors described a terrifying scene of tents in flames and burn victims after what the Gaza Health Ministry said was an Israeli strike on a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. The ministry said at least 45 people in the camp had been killed and 240 others wounded. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah. Credit: AP The Israeli military said that it had aimed a strike at a Hamas compound and killed two Hamas leaders. A legal official with the military said the strike was under review. Bilal al-Sapti, 30, a construction worker in Rafah, said he saw charred bodies in the wreckage of the camp in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah, and people screaming as firefighters tried to put out the flames. “The fire was very strong and was all over the camp,” he said. “There was darkness and no electricity.” Sapti said shrapnel from the strike tore up the tent where he was staying with his wife and two children, but that his family was uninjured. Palestinians mourn over the bodies of relatives killed by the Israeli airstrike, at a morgue in Rafah. Credit: AP “What kind of a tent will protect us from missiles and shrapnel?” he said. UNRWA, the main United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, described on the social media platform X what it called a horrifying attack and said the images emerging from the site were “yet another testament” that Gaza is “hell on earth”. Multiple videos from the same location, verified by The New York Times , show fires raging through the night as people frantically pull bodies from the rubble and shout in horror as they carry away charred remains. By morning, several shed-like structures were flattened, and cars were burnt out, the footage shows. The sheds are part of a displaced persons camp known as the Kuwaiti al-Salam Camp 1. The Times verified that the locations seen in various videos showing fires raging and burnt bodies were from the same camp, by comparing them to previous videos of the site from aid groups. In a statement on Instagram, one of the groups that supports the camp, Al-Salam Association for Humanitarian and Charitable Works, said that, besides dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries, more than 120 tents and dozens of toilets were burnt and damaged, and that a water well was destroyed. Adli Abu Taha, 33, a freelance journalist who was at a nearby field hospital run by the United Arab Emirates Red Crescent, said the dead and wounded began arriving there shortly after he heard two loud explosions. Loading “Several injured arrived without one or more limbs and were severely burned,” Abu Taha said. “The hospital soon became overwhelmed,” he added. When Abu Taha went to the tent camp in the morning, all he could see was “destruction” coupled with “the smell of smoke and burnt flesh,” he said. He said that some families were dismantling their tents and preparing to find another place to seek shelter. Dr Marwan al-Hams, who was at the Tal al-Sultan Health Centre in Rafah where many of the casualties first arrived before being transferred to nearby field hospitals, said that of the killed and wounded he saw, a majority were women and children. “Many of the dead bodies were severely burnt, had amputated limbs and were torn to pieces,” he said. Mohammed Abu Ghanem, 26, said that he and the 13 other people who had been sheltering in a tent with him in the camp were wondering where to go. “I hear that everywhere is being bombed and I have no cash to pay for the trucks that evacuate people,” he said, adding: “We have no other option but to remain here and wait for death.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times .

        "content": "Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Israel pounded Rafah with airstrikes and tank fire on Tuesday, pressing its offensive in Gaza's southern city despite international condemnation of an attack that sparked a blaze in a tent camp for the displaced, killing at least 45 people. At least 16 Palestinians were killed in strikes overnight on Tuesday, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. Reacting to Sunday night's strike and fire in a camp where thousands of families displaced from assaults elsewhere in the Gaza Strip had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Before the latest advancement, Israeli tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and entered some of its eastern districts, residents said, but have not yet entered the city in full force. Residents said Israeli tanks were stationed on and around the Zurub hilltop, a high ground overlooking western Rafah, having advanced from the area near the Egyptian border crossing where Israeli forces launched an incursion three weeks ago. They said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said. On Tuesday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed and wounded several Palestinians in a house in the Falouja neighborhood. Civil emergency teams said they believed many bodies were under the rubble of buildings where they can't be reached. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” said Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz, however, lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas armed group. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian National Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian National Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza with East Jerusalem through a corridor. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israel’s ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent “appalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)” in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee “stressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.” It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of “discussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.” It called for “confronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people” and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said. Arab countries and organizations slammed on Monday Israel for its strikes on a center for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens near the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement that the strikes \"claimed the lives of 35 martyrs and left dozens injured, most of them children and women\". The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza earlier said the attack hit a center run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a \"horrific massacre\". The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a \"heinous massacre\", accusing Israeli forces of \"deliberately targeting\" the tents of displaced people. The massacre is an act of \"defiance to all international resolutions,\" it added in a statement. Gaza's civil defense agency said Israeli strikes killed and wounded at least 50 people in the area, where it said 100,000 displaced people live. Hamas said Palestinians must \"rise up and march\" against the attack. The Israeli army said it had targeted Hamas fighters. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian armed group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\" Palestinians carry a body after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, 27 May 2024. (EPA) Qatar said on Monday the latest Israeli attack on Rafah could hinder mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a foreign ministry statement said. Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack, saying the Israeli forces’ actions against Palestinians \"exposes their blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world.\" \"This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including the International Justice Court resolution on immediately ceasing the aggression against Rafah, and protecting the Palestinian people,\" it demanded in a statement. Egypt strongly condemned the attack, saying Israeli forces \"deliberately\" targeted the displaced. The Foreign Ministry said Cairo had called on Israel \"to meet its legal commitments as an occupying power\" and respect the International Court of Justice’s call on it to immediately cease its military operations. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry condemned the \"ongoing heinous war crimes committed by the Israeli forces in Gaza,\" saying the latest attack in Rafah was a \"flagrant challenge to the ICJ and grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\" The Arab Parliament echoed the condemnation, warning in a statement that \"failure to hold Israel to account for its crimes and massacres against the Palestinians and failure to take any deterrent measures against it will only make it commit more killings and cause more destruction.\" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation slammed the \"heinous Israeli massacre against Palestinian civilians,\" describing it as a \"war crime, crime against humanity and state organized terrorism\" and demanding that Israel be held to account before international justice. The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting Tuesday over an Israeli strike that killed dozens in a displaced persons camp in Rafah, as three European countries were slated to formally recognize a Palestinian state. AFP journalists on the ground early Tuesday reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight in the southern Gaza border city, where an Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement center, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials. The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\". Israel said it was looking into the \"tragic accident\". \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres posted on social media. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths pointed to the widespread warnings of civilian deaths that circulated ahead of Israel's incursion into Rafah, saying in a statement: \"We've seen the consequences in last night's utterly unacceptable attack.\" \"To call it 'a mistake' is a message that means nothing for those killed, those grieving, and those trying to save lives,\" he added. Diplomats said the UN Security Council would convene Tuesday for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. The EU's foreign policy chief said he was \"horrified by news\" of the strike, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\", and a US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\". The Israeli military said it was launching a probe. - 'Don't know where to go' - Displaced Gazan Khalil al-Bahtini was preparing to leave the impacted area, telling AFP Monday that \"last night, the tent opposite to ours was targeted\". \"We have loaded all our belongings, but we don't know where to go.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament the deaths occurred \"despite our best efforts\" to protect civilians. The outcry over the strike came as Spain, Ireland and Norway were set to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas. \"Recognizing the state of Palestine is about justice for the Palestinian people,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Monday in Brussels. It was also \"the best guarantee of security for Israel and absolutely essential for reaching peace in the region\", he said alongside his Irish and Norwegian counterparts. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had told Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to West Bank Palestinians from June 1 as a \"preliminary punitive\" measure. - 'Charred bodies' - Israel launched the deadly strike on Rafah late Sunday, hours after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" in the city and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. Gaza's civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. \"We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly,\" said civil defense agency official Mohammad al-Mughayyir. One survivor, a woman who declined to be named, said: \"We heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming.\" Adding to already heightened tensions since Israel launched its Rafah ground operation, the Israeli and Egyptian militaries reported a \"shooting incident\" on Monday that killed one Egyptian guard in the border area between Egypt and the southern Gaza Strip. Both forces said they were investigating. - 'Dangerous violation' - Footage from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of paramedics racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded. Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impact of Israel's siege, which has led to severe shortages of fuel and \"water to extinguish fires\". The Israeli attack sparked strong protests from Egypt and Qatar, both of which have played key roles as mediators in efforts to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange. Egypt deplored what it called the \"targeting of defenseless civilians\", saying it was part of \"a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable\". Qatar condemned a \"dangerous violation of international law\" and voiced \"concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts\" towards a truce. The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered Israel to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about \"the physical destruction\" of the Palestinians. The war in Gaza started after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on social media platform X that \"with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible\". \"The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,\" he said.",

        "description": "The Labour party has confirmed it will push ahead with the government’s plans to introduce a British ISA if elected to power but will keep the much-hyped sale of Natwest shares under “review”, City A.M. can reveal.",
        "content": "The Labour party is intending to push ahead with the government’s plans to introduce a British ISA if elected to power in a boost to efforts to get cash flowing into the stock market. The comments mark Labour’s first public stance on one of the government’s flagship City reform policies, after days of doubt over whether Rachel Reeves and Keir Starmer would push ahead with the schemes. Plans for a British ISA were announced by the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his March budget this year to tempt more investors into the stock market with a £5000 tax-free allowance for investment in British listed companies. Under the timelines set out by Hunt, a consultation on the plans will close on the 6th June and no firm date has been marked to launch the products into the market. Those timelines were thrown into doubt by Rishi Sunak’s move to call an early election in July and pushed the Treasury to place “everything under review”, a source told City A.M . last week. However, the Labour party has indicated it will now back the ISA plans if elected to power in a boost to efforts to get money flowing back into the stock market. “Labour has no plans to drop the British ISA,” a spokesperson told City A.M. “Labour wants to make it as easy as possible for people to feel the benefits of saving and investing their money, including through increased utilisation of stocks and shares ISAs.” The backing from Labour marks its most firm stance yet on ISA plans after it pledged to “simplify the ISA landscape” last year. The move may also restore some certainty to the Treasury’s post-election planning, which has been plunged into chaos by Sunak’s gamble to hold the election in July rather than the Autumn. Ministers have been looking to overhaul the regulation and rules around the City amid fears over its attractiveness as a financial centre, but a number of the plans remain a work-in-progress. Under Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the Labour party has vying for the affections of business and has broadly backed the government’s City reform agenda, including efforts to unlock more capital into the markets. However, it is unclear where its priorities will lie and which specific measures it will take forward if elected, effectively causing the Treasury to press pause and shelve some of its work. Among the areas thrown into doubt by the election are the plans to offload a chunk of the government’s remaining stake in Natwest to retail investors, drawn up by the government in a bid to ignite a culture of investment in the UK. In his budget in March, Jeremy Hunt described the sale as a “tell Sid” style moment for investing in the UK, a reference to the Thatcher-era move to privatise British Gas and sell shares to the public. The plans were already on shaky ground after the Treasury U-turned on the intended structure of the deal and paused a bidding process with retail investment platforms to handle the sale, City A.M . previously revealed. After Sunak called the election on Wednesday, the Treasury confirmed last week that the sale will not go ahead during the election period. The Labour party has now said it is yet to make a firm decision on whether to push ahead with the plans if elected. “Labour will review the details if we form the next government after the general election,” a Labour spokesperson told City A.M. “Any decisions we take will be about ensuring value for money for the taxpayer and investors.” Natwest itself has been buying back its shares from the government and it now looks likely that the Treasury and UKGI, the body that manages the investment on behalf of the government, will sell the shares via other methods.",

        "description": "كشفت صحيفة \"الغارديان\" البريطانية أن الرئيس السابق لجهاز الموساد الإسرائيلي، يوسي كوهين، هدد المدعية العامة للمحكمة الجنائية الدولية في سلسلة من الاجتماعات السرية حاول خلالها الضغط عليها للتخلي عن التحقيق في جرائم الحرب.",
        "content": "وجرت الاتصالات السرية التي أجراها كوهين مع المدعية العامة للمحكمة الجنائية الدولية آنذاك، فاتو بنسودا في السنوات التي سبقت قرارها فتح تحقيق رسمي في جرائم الحرب في الأراضي الفلسطينية المحتلة. ونقلت \"الغارديان\" عن مسؤول إسرائيلي بارز قوله إن \"تورط كوهين شخصيا في العملية ضد المحكمة الجنائية الدولية حدث عندما كان مديرا للموساد، وقد تم التصريح بأنشطته على مستوى عالٍ وتم تبريرها على أساس أن المحكمة شكلت تهديدا بملاحقة أفراد عسكريين\". وقال مصدر إسرائيلي آخر مطلع على العملية ضد بنسودا إن هدف الموساد هو تجنيد المدعية كشخص يتعاون مع مطالب إسرائيل. وقال مصدر ثالث مطلع على العملية إن كوهين كان بمثابة \"الرسول غير الرسمي\" لبنيامين نتنياهو. وأكدت أربعة مصادر أن بنسودا أطلعت مجموعة صغيرة من كبار مسؤولي المحكمة الجنائية الدولية على محاولات كوهين التأثير عليها، وسط مخاوف بشأن طبيعة سلوكه المستمرة والمهددة بشكل متزايد. وكان ثلاثة من تلك المصادر على دراية بإفصاحات بنسودا الرسمية للمحكمة الجنائية الدولية حول هذه المسألة. وقالوا إنها كشفت أن كوهين مارس ضغوطا عليها في عدة مناسبات لعدم المضي قدما في تحقيق جنائي في قضية فلسطين أمام المحكمة الجنائية الدولية. وفقا لمصدرين على دراية مباشرة بالأمر، اهتم الموساد بشدة بأفراد عائلة بنسودا وحصل على نسخ من التسجيلات السرية لزوجها، ثم حاول المسؤولون الإسرائيليون استخدام هذه المواد لتشويه سمعتها. وقالت \"الغارديان\": في جهود الموساد للتأثير على بنسودا، تلقت إسرائيل الدعم من حليف غير متوقع، وهو جوزيف كابيلا، الرئيس السابق لجمهورية الكونغو الديمقراطية\". تشكل المعلومات التي تم الكشف عنها حول عملية كوهين جزءا من تحقيق قادم تجريه صحيفة الغارديان، ومجلة +972 الإسرائيلية، ومجلة \"لوكال كول\" الناطقة بالعبرية، والتي تكشف كيف أدارت وكالات استخبارات إسرائيلية متعددة \"حربا\" سرية ضد المحكمة الجنائية الدولية لمدة تقرب من عام. وفي اتصال مع صحيفة الغارديان، قال متحدث باسم مكتب رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي: \"الأسئلة المقدمة إلينا مليئة بالعديد من الادعاءات الكاذبة التي لا أساس لها والتي تهدف إلى إيذاء دولة إسرائيل\". ولم يستجب كوهين لطلب التعليق، كما رفضت بنسودا التعليق.",

        "content": "By Eric Armit HIGHLIGHTS from the past week of action Lawrence Okolie won the WBC Bridgerweight title with a first-round destruction of Lukasz Rozanski, while Fiodor Czerkaszyn and Ihosvany Garcia also won. Jack Catterall scored a unanimous decision over Josh Taylor to gain revenge for his controversial loss to Taylor in 2022. There were wins for Cheavon Clarke, Paddy Donovan and Gary Cully. Christian Mbilli scored a first-round KO over Mark Heffron, and Arslanbek Makhmudov knocked out Miljan Rovcanin in the second round. Batyrzhan Jukembayev stopped Ivan Redkach in the fifth round. There were inside-the-distance wins for Jermaine Franklin and Ali Akhmedov in Detroit. Vlad Panin scored a controversial second-round win over Devon Alexander. Former European Championships gold medallist Balasz Bacskai won the vacant WBO European titles and now retires with an 18-0 record. Alexei Papin halted veteran Isaac Chilemba in three rounds. Dana Thorsland outpointed Seran Cetin in defence of her WBC and WBO bantamweight titles. Commonwealth champion Tysie Gallagher retained her title as she outpointed Stevi Levy to become the first holder of the female version of the British super-bantamweight title. Who won the week? Most s ignificant: Jack Catterall’s win over Josh Taylor will hopefully lead to a title shot for Catterall. Most e ntertaining: Not high profile, but Jonathan Cardoso vs. Adam Lopez was an entertaining clash of styles. Fighter of the week : Jack Catterall, with honourable mention to Christian “Solide” Mbilli, who produced another power show. Punch of the week : The left hook to the body from Mbilli that ended his fight with Mark Heffron was brutal, but so was the one from Ihosvany Garcia that felled Lukasz Plawecki. Upset of the week: Dane Mikkel Nielsen, 12-2, was not expected to beat the home fighter, 20-1-2 Renato Egedi, but he disposed of him in two rounds. Prospect watch: Cuban Ihosvany Garcia, 13-0 (10 by KO/TKO), now has wins over Ryno Liebenberg and 22-1 Patrick Rokhol. Fight Card Observations Rosette: To Matchroom for the only big show in town and four competitive high-quality matches. The Polish show had a world title fight, but the undercard was underwhelming. Red Card: Bob Arum for his attack on the judging in the Catterall vs. Taylor fight. I thought the scores were too wide, but I had it 115-113. If the judges scored one round differently to the way I saw it, that would make it 116-112, and for three rounds, it would be 117-111, so disagreeing on three rounds out of twelve is no big deal. Lawrence Okolie won the WBC Bridgerweight title on Friday. The limit for the Bridgerweight division is 224lbs. Oleksandr Usyk weighed 223 1⁄2 lbs when winning the WBC heavyweight title last week! Now, why was it necessary to have this division between cruiserweight and heavyweight? Surely not for yet another load of sanctioning fees for the huge number of titles in every weight division. May 25 Catterall gets sweet revenge over Taylor Catterall gained revenge for his split decision defeat in 2022 as he scored a unanimous decision in this one. The first round saw both boxers probing with their right jabs. Catterall landed a good right to the head and although Taylor was taking the fight to Catterall he was having problems getting into range. They clashed heads early in the second, and luckily, neither was hurt, but as they were both constantly leaning forward, clashes were inevitable, and they clashed again at the start of the third. Tayor had a better round attacking with more purpose, and he made good use of his right hook to offset the side-on stance of Catterall. The fourth saw Catterall work hard and accurately with his jab, slotting punches through the guard of Taylor as Taylor came forward, and he landed a left to the head that forced Taylor to back away. At that point I had it 39-37 for Catterall with the three judges having Catterall ahead 40-36, 40-36 and 39-37 for Catterall. Catterall moved even further ahead in the fifth as he caught Taylor time and again with stabbing jabs, then scored with a series of punches, including a hard left hook, and although the pace dropped in the sixth, again, it was Catterall doing the superior work. For me, Taylor was now four points behind, and the fight was slipping further and further away from him. He responded by taking the seventh and eighth. He put Catterall under more pressure, staying on top of him, giving Catterall no punching room, and connecting with some good lefts as Catterall’s output dropped. My score at that point was 77-75 for Catterall, with the judges’ scores 79-73, 79-74, and 77-75 for Catterall. The ninth saw Catterall bounce back, moving more using his jab again, and he put together a flashing combination that forced Taylor to retreat. Taylor came on strong at the end of the round, but it was Catterall’s round. It was Taylor’s turn to up his pace, and in the tenth, he had Catterall backing up under a series of body punches to take the round. Leeds, UK: Josh Taylor v Jack Catterall, Super Lightweight Contest. 25 May 2024. Picture By Mark Robinson Matchroom Boxing. The eleventh was a big round for Catterall. As Taylor came forward, Catterall met him with a left hook that staggered Taylor and had him backing off badly shaken. Catterall followed him across the ring to the ropes, firing punches with both hands. Catterall then threw away the chance to force a finish as he became entangled with Taylor. He wrapped his arm around Taylor’s neck, and as he leaned over, he tipped Taylor off balance and forced Taylor down, then fell on top of him. Although Catterall had more success in the round, Taylor had recovered when the tangle was sorted out and he could fire back. The last saw Catterall forcing hard early in the round and Taylor taking over and finishing stronger to take the round, but it was not enough. I had it 115-113 for Catterall, but the judges had it 117-111 twice and 116-113 for Catterall. There was no title on the line, but who needs one anyway? May 25 Mbilli wipes out Heffron in Canada Christian Mbilli wiped out Mark Heffron in 40 seconds. Heffron tried to use his longer reach to score with jabs, but Mbilli forced him to the ropes. Mbilli landed a couple of body shots and a right to the head, with Heffron sliding along the ropes. Mbilli followed him and then connected with a savage left hook to the body that sent Heffron down. He managed to get as far as putting his hands and knees on the canvas but then could go no further and crawled along the canvas whilst the referee counted him out. The Cameroon-born Frenchman made it 23 inside the distance wins. He was defending his WBC Continental and WBA International belts. Although not filling the No 1 position, he is rated in the top 3 by all four sanctioning bodies and a real dangerman to Saul Alvarez and David Benavidez. Englishman Heffron, a former British and Commonwealth title holder, was just blown away. Talk is that Mbilli will meet Sergey Derevyanchenko in August. Makhmudov returns strong after Kabayel defeat Arslanbek Makhmudov cut down Miljan Rovcanin inside two rounds. Rovcanin only just made it outside the first round. A right hand finished him off in the second. It was a typical display of brute strength with no real technical skills from Makhmudov. It has won him 18 fights by KO/TKO, but his faults were magnified in his fight against Agit Kabayel in December when he was floored three times and stopped in the fourth. Serb Rovcanin has built his record on questionable opposition and quick-time losses against Kabayel and Jared Anderson have shown his ceiling. Arslanbek Makhmudov (Vincent Ethier/Eye of the Tiger) May 24 Okolie destroys Rozanski in one Okolie demolished Rozanski in the first round to win the WBC Bridgerweight title. Okolie found the target with his jab and a left to the head appeared to shake Rozanski. Okolie landed an overhand right that sent Rozanski crashing to the canvas on his back. He immediately climbed to his feet, and after the eight count, Rozanski tried to come forward but was forced back to the ropes, and another right, which curled around the back of Rozanski’s ear, put him down again. Rozanski was a little slower getting up and complained the punch had landed to the back of his head, which was as much a case of Rozanski dropping his head forward as the punch was in transit as any intent from Okolie. After the count, Okolie drove Rozanski to the ropes and landed a crushing right cross and a brutal right uppercut that dropped Rozanski to his hands and knees. He climbed up at seven but was still badly shaken and the referee waived the fight over, making former cruiserweight champion Okolie a two-division champion. This was his first fight since losing his WBO belt to Chris Billiam-Smith. For Rozanski, it was a case of the biter being bitten as he had beaten both Artur Szpilka and Alen Babic in the first round of his last two fights. (Piotr Duszczyk/boxingphotos.pl)",

        "content": "While AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini have gained immense popularity for their conversational abilities, Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun believes these large language models have limitations and will never be as intelligent as humans. In an interview with Financial Times, LeCun said chatbots only have surface-level understanding and lack reasoning, planning and real- knowledge that distinguishes human intelligence. LeCun explained that although chatbots can answer prompts accurately based on their extensive training, they don't truly comprehend language or grasp logic and causation. Their responses are simply outputs triggered by certain inputs in the data, rather than inferences drawn from accumulated knowledge. He noted chatbots cannot apply learning to new situations or think hierarchically – essential traits of human-level general intelligence. Despite their use as helpful tools, LeCun warned against overestimating chatbots' potential. Unlike humans, they have no persistent memory, cannot adapt or plan ahead based on past experiences. Their safety also depends entirely on training data quality rather than an innate ability to determine right from wrong. Moving closer to human-level intelligence, Meta's new research group is taking a scientific approach through ‘world modeling'. This involves teaching AI systems to understand how the physical world functions in a common-sense manner, much like humans. However, developing artificial general intelligence poses immense scientific challenges beyond today's . While chatbots entertain and inform, LeCun's insights provide a realistic perspective on their limitations compared to human intelligence. Continued research holds the key to more capable, yet reliably safe AI systems in the future.",

A TST, com cerca de 900 trabalhadores, serve os concelhos de Almada, Seixal e Sesimbra. Os trabalhadores que já tinham realizado 24 horas de greve em 09 de maio decidiram, na segunda-feira, em plenário manter a paralisação agendada para hoje e marcar mais dois dias de greve, em 05 e 25 de junho. O plenário foi convocado pelo Sindicato dos Trabalhadores de Transportes Rodoviários e Urbanos de Portugal (STRUP), afeto à Federação dos Sindicatos de Transportes e Comunicações (Fectrans), e pelo Sindicato Nacional dos Motoristas (SNMOT) para dar a conhecer aos trabalhadores a proposta entretanto apresentada pela TST, que opera no distrito de Setúbal, numa reunião realizada no dia 20 de maio. Sara Gligó, dirigente da Fectrans, explicou em declarações à agência Lusa que a empresa apresentou algumas alterações à proposta inicial, deixando cair, por exemplo, a obrigatoriedade de o subsídio de refeição ser pago em cartão, uma das reivindicações dos trabalhadores, aumentando o valor para 7,30 euros a partir de 01 de junho. Por outro lado, adiantou, a empresa manifestou também disponibilidade para aplicar 5,89% de aumento em 2024, com um mínimo de aumento de 60 euros. Além disso, a empresa está também disponível para igualar em 31 de dezembro os salários dos trabalhadores da TST aos ordenados praticados pela empresa Alsa Todi (que opera nos concelhos de Alcochete, Barreiro, Moita, Montijo, Palmela e Setúbal), para que os trabalhadores da península de Setúbal fiquem com os salários nivelados. Contudo, explicou a sindicalista, os trabalhadores entendem que os valores propostos pela empresa ainda não chegam aos 80 euros de aumento e aos 9,60 euros de subsídio de refeição que reivindicam, pelo que ratificaram a greve marcada para terça-feira e marcaram mais dois dias de paralisação, em 05 e 25 de junho.

Rendas de deslocados em trabalho a mais de 100 km poderão ser deduzidas As pessoas que tenham de ir trabalhar para mais de 100 quilómetros e queiram rentabilizar a sua habitação vão poder deduzir a este rendimento a renda da casa junto ao novo emprego. A proposta de lei aprovada pelo Governo visa eliminar desincentivos à mobilidade laboral, criando uma neutralidade entre o que se recebe de renda da casa que se deixa e a renda que se paga pela casa que tenha de se arrendar. \" Quando alguém tiver de ir trabalhar para um local a mais de 100 quilómetros de casa e ao sair arrenda a sua casa a um terceiro e tenha de arrendar [uma nova] casa, permitimos que a renda paga seja deduzida à que se recebe na casa de origem \", referiu o ministro. Desta forma, o IRS pago pela renda recebida incidirá apenas sobre o que restar após a dedução da casa arrendada no novo local de trabalho, criando-se uma situação de neutralidade. O ministro referiu que não estão previstos limites aos valores que se podem deduzir uma vez que a medida tem como limite o valor da renda que se vai pagar e o rendimento gerado pela casa que se tem. Apoio à renda volta a abranger inquilinos com contrato alterado Há também uma mudança no apoio às rendas para que as pessoas que perderam este subsídio , por ter ocorrido alteração ao contrato, possam voltar a recebê-lo. Em causa está o cumprimento de uma das medidas previstas na nova estratégia para a habitação, aprovada pelo Governo no início de maio, em que se permite recuperar para o apoio extraordinário às rendas as pessoas que tinham um contrato anterior a 15 de março de 2023 e que o perderam por ter havido uma alteração e esta ter sido classificada como sendo um novo contrato de arrendamento. \" O que dizemos é que se havia um contrato antes de 15 março de 2023 e se [este se] mantém entre as mesmas partes e no mesmo imóvel, faz-se esta equiparação e permite-se corrigir esta iniquidade \", afirmou Leitão Amaro. Desta forma, mantendo-se as partes e o imóvel, o inquilino que teve o apoio vai voltar a recebê-lo mesmo que tenha havido uma alteração, renovação ou substituição do contrato existente antes de 15 de março de 2023, desde que a pessoa mantenha os requisitos como ter uma taxa de esforço com o pagamento da renda superior a 35%. Governo vai criar regime de uso de imóveis públicos devolutos O Governo vai criar um regime legal para \"injeção semiautomática de imóveis devolutos\" públicos no mercado, para habitação ou outros projetos relevantes, o que será feito em conjunto com os municípios , na sequência da decisão de pôr fim ao arrendamento coercivo previsto no programa Mais Habitação. \" Este é um regime novo, em que a iniciativa de base local permite acelerar, identificar e pôr, depois da recuperação, à disposição, quer para habitação, quer para outros fins públicos relevantes, tantas centenas de imóveis públicos do Estado que hoje estão parados, enquanto há tantas pessoas sem casa ou casas caras demais \", disse o ministro da Presidência. Leitão Amaro revelou que caberá aos municípios de \"forma voluntária\", por si ou com promotores privados, identificar os imóveis públicos devolutos ou subutilizados e apresentar depois ao Estado, nomeadamente através da Estamo, um projeto de utilização \"para um fim público que caiba dentro das atribuições do município e possa ser colocado em fruição pelas pessoas\". O governante destacou que esta \"via verde\" para as autarquias é voluntária e cada projeto desenhado \"tem de estar dentro das atribuições\" do município e ser dirigido a um fim público. Caso a gestão dos imóveis propostos caiba à Estamo, esta apenas se pode opor se o projeto apresentado pelo município não cumprir o interesse público ou caso já tenha um projeto público iminente para aquele imóvel. O novo regime, de iniciativa de base local, permite acelerar a utilização de milhares de imóveis públicos do Estado que estão atualmente sem utilização para habitação pública ou outros projetos, acrescentou. Aprovada proposta para revogar contribuição no Alojamento Local Foram aprovadas propostas de alteração às regras do alojamento local (AL) incluídas pelo anterior executivo no programa Mais Habitação, como a revogação da contribuição extraordinária, remetendo para os municípios a regulamentação da atividade nos seus territórios. \" Revogamos uma série de proibições regulatórias e alteramos outras, que tinham como consequências precarizar ou afetar licenças passadas de pessoas que tinham investido na década passada, esperando ter retornos no longo prazo e que esse retorno, essa confiança no investimento, tinha sido traído pela ação do Estado \", sublinhou. Uma das medidas, segundo o ministro, é a revogação de uma fixação do coeficiente de vetustez, \"que na prática tinha como consequência agravar o IMI dos imóveis em alojamento local\". O Executivo conta com a ajuda dos municípios, que poderão fazer as regras e fiscalizar a sua aplicação tendo em conta a realidade no seu território, para permitir \"encontrar situações diferenciadas, mas mais harmónicas\". Os municípios poderão ter um papel \"regulador, mas também mediador nos conflitos\" entre proprietários dentro de imóveis em propriedade horizontal e estabelecer quais as condições para emissão e registo de novas licenças. Leitão Amaro sublinhou que estas revogações, nomeadamente \"da situação das licenças\", não significam uma liberalização sem limites ou uma desregulação do mercado onde atua o alojamento local. Governo diz que está a acabar com visão punitiva no mercado da habitação O ministro da Presidência recusou que o Governo esteja a liberalizar e a desregular o mercado da habitação , contrapondo que o objetivo é equilibrar regras e acabar com uma visão punitiva que castigava o investimento. \" Substituímos uma visão punitiva, injusta e castradora do investimento por uma visão equilibrada moderada, que reconhece que há zonas de maior pressão urbanística e turísticas onde podem sentido regras mais equilibradas \", sustentou o governante. De acordo com António Leitão Amaro, o Governo, em primeira linha, nesta questão da regulação ao alojamento local, \"aposta nas autarquias e na sua capacidade de fazerem regras e serem elas a fiscalizar a sua aplicação e implementação, permitindo encontrar soluções diferenciadas mas mais harmónicas\".

        "description": "O futebolista Salvador Agra descreve com um misto de emoções a permanência do Boavista na I Liga, n...",
        "content": "\"D evido a tudo o que aconteceu no último jogo, a sensação que passa é de alívio. Foi um misto de emoções, de tristeza e de felicidade, no qual relembrámos vários momentos que passámos. No fim de contas, merecíamos isto, porque fomos uns verdadeiros campeões durante uma época inteira e o único clube que não conseguiu contratar ninguém nos dois mercados de transferências. Pelo contrário, houve uma saída importante do Tiago Morais [em janeiro]. Isto é só para os fortes\", ilustrou o avançado, em entrevista à agência Lusa. Um penálti de Miguel Reisinho, aos 90+11 minutos, permitiu às 'panteras' empatarem em casa com o já despromovido Vizela (2-2), na 34.a e decisiva jornada, e acabarem a I Liga no 15.o lugar, derradeiro de salvação direta, com os mesmos 32 pontos do Portimonense, 16.o e antepenúltimo, que seria relegado para o play-off por causa do pior saldo de golos. \"O Reisinho até pensava que era eu que iria bater esse penálti, mas o Bruno Lourenço é que os costuma marcar. Como ele já não estava em campo naquela altura, eu peguei na bola e entreguei-a ao Reisinho, até porque tinha plena confiança nele. É um jogador com muita qualidade, que sabe gerir bem os momentos e merecia ter uma alegria destas por tudo aquilo que já passou. É alguém de quem é difícil não gostar\", contou Salvador Agra. O último pontapé da temporada livrou o Boavista de uma eliminatória a duas mãos com o AVS, terceiro colocado da II Liga, retirando qualquer efeito ao triunfo do Portimonense na visita ao 'vizinho' Farense (1-3), numa tarde em que o Estrela da Amadora também selou a permanência, ao vencer em casa o Gil Vicente (1-0) e finalizar em 14.o, com 33 pontos. \"Sabíamos que a luta seria a três. Tínhamos a vantagem de que só dependíamos de nós, mas, em campo, estávamos apenas focados em ganhar o nosso jogo e não a pensar no resultado dos outros. Com o decorrer das coisas e o ambiente que estava [nas bancadas do Estádio do Bessa, no Porto], é normal que nos tivéssemos apercebido de que alguma coisa não estava bem no outro lado [na partida em Faro], nem nos era favorável\", admitiu. O Boavista cumpriu o principal objetivo pela 10.a época seguida, mas teve a classificação e pontuação mais baixas desde a sua reintegração administrativa na I Liga, em 2014/15, refletindo a constante turbulência sentida dentro e fora das quatro linhas, com sucessivas trocas de comando técnico, entre Petit, Ricardo Paiva e Jorge Simão, e a substituição de Vítor Murta pelo senegalês Fary Faye, ex-avançado dos 'axadrezados', à frente da SAD. \"Mesmo não tendo contratações, havia uma base forte da época anterior. Se calhar, isso permitiria não ter o desfecho [tão sofrido] que tivemos. Agora, sabíamos que ia ser difícil, duro e que só unidos e dando as mãos durante a época é que íamos atingir o objetivo da manutenção\", disse Salvador Agra, terceiro jogador mais utilizado pela equipa do Bessa, com 34 encontros, nos quais fez três golos e quatro assistências, registo igual a 2022/23. Além dos atuais impedimentos de inscrição de novos jogadores ditados pela FIFA, os constantes problemas financeiros causaram salários em atraso no Boavista, cujo melhor arranque do século XXI - período iniciado com um inédito título de campeão nacional, em 2000/01 - até permitiu o comando partilhado da I Liga à segunda, quarta e quinta rondas. \"Todos nós trabalhamos e temos obrigações ao fim do mês para cumprir, mas não houve confusão neste grupo acerca dos salários. É normal que comentássemos e não vou dizer que não é algo importante, mas, quando o apito inicial soava e a bola começava a rolar, abstraíamo-nos. Tentámos passar essa mensagem e a malta foi compreensiva\", reiterou. Partilhe a notícia PUB Transferência de crédito: Não teme a mudança?

        "content": "\"S abíamos aquilo que ele era e continua a ser nesta casa: uma pessoa muito importante, à qual já estávamos habituados e que sente o clube de forma especial. Tínhamos ali um segundo pai. Foi um choque para nós quando o 'mister' Petit tomou a decisão de querer sair. Tentámos que ele ficasse connosco, porque sabíamos que era uma força grande no nosso balneário, conhece esta casa melhor do que ninguém e é um excelente treinador. Aliás, os resultados estão à vista\", enquadrou o avançado, em entrevista à agência Lusa. Quatro vitórias e um empate deram ao Boavista o comando partilhado do campeonato à segunda, quarta e quinta jornadas, mas um ciclo de oito partidas sem ganhar - incluindo cinco derrotas seguidas - diluiu o efeito do melhor arranque 'axadrezado' no século XXI. O desaire na visita ao Estrela da Amadora (3-1), na 13.a ronda, precedeu a demissão de Petit, campeão nacional como jogador no Bessa, em 2000/01, que fechou uma segunda passagem de dois anos pelo clube no qual se estreara como técnico, entre 2012 e 2015. \"Seguiu o caminho dele e nós compreendemos a sua decisão. O futebol é isto mesmo e, por vezes, há que tomar decisões que, por muito que não se queira, são as melhores no momento. Seria hipócrita da minha parte estar a dizer que o Petit abandonou o barco. É totalmente mentira. Esse assunto ficou muito bem esclarecido entre todos. Ele disse-nos que estava a tomar aquela decisão por ser a melhor para a sua vida pessoal e para ver também se alguma coisa mudaria. Foi um verdadeiro campeão\", explicou Salvador Agra. Ricardo Paiva foi promovido dos sub-19 do Boavista para substituir o atual treinador dos brasileiros do Cuiabá, mas a queda progressiva na classificação seria inevitável para um plantel curto de opções, impedido de registar novos jogadores e com salários em atraso. \"Depois de uma temporada com esta história toda, este grupo tem de ficar marcado para estes adeptos. Pode ser não da maneira como aconteceu em 18 de maio de 2001 [dia da conquista do inédito título de campeão nacional], mas, num cenário totalmente diferente, deve-se dar valor a este grupo por tudo aquilo que passou. Se fosse com outro grupo ou clube, acho que muito dificilmente conseguiriam fazer o que nós conseguimos\", apontou. A saída do extremo Tiago Morais para o Lille, de Paulo Fonseca, em janeiro, numa altura em que era o segundo mais influente, com seis golos, a dois de Róbert Bozeník, agravou a contestação dos adeptos, motivo dado por Vítor Murta para renunciar à presidência da SAD em fevereiro, após a goleada do Sporting de Braga no Bessa (0-4), na 23.a jornada. Essa vaga foi preenchida pouco mais de dois meses depois pelo ex-avançado senegalês Fary Faye, que tinha representado o Boavista como avançado em duas fases (de 2003 a 2008 e entre 2012 e 2015) e juntava nove anos de experiência diretiva naquela estrutura. \"É uma pessoa importante, até porque conhece a casa, já passou por esta profissão [de futebolista] e sabe os momentos em que se tem de tocar no coração de um jogador. Está agora numa faceta diferente e temos a crença de que vai fazer um trabalho espetacular. Acima de tudo, e além de ser presidente, o Fary é nosso amigo\", pontuou Salvador Agra. Durante a mudança de ciclo na SAD, o Boavista voltou a trocar de treinador, com Ricardo Paiva a sair após a derrota em Arouca (2-1), na 29.a jornada, dando lugar a Jorge Simão, que retornou ao Bessa cinco anos depois da passagem inicial (de 2017 a 2019) e obteve três empates nas cinco partidas finais, suficientes para uma manutenção sofrida na elite. \"O currículo fala por si. Tem experiência e já conhecia a casa. Parecendo que não, ajuda. Ele sabia que vínhamos de uma época larga e muito desgastante e teve o intuito de nos ajudar e dar força. Ele próprio diz para fora que veio com uma mala cheia de entusiasmo. Não é que não tivéssemos isso, mas queria que desfrutássemos da profissão\", concluiu.

        "content": "\"É muito importante. Em primeiro lugar, todos os seis países dos PALOP têm potencialidade agrícola. São países que já têm algum laço com o Brasil e o Brasil traz aquilo que o nosso presidente [do Banco Africano de Desenvolvimento (BAD)] quer dar prioridade, que é desenvolvimento de capacitação profissional e desenvolvimento de competências\", explicou a responsável, à margem dos encontros anuais do BAD, que decorrem até sexta-feira em Nairobi. Assinado em novembro de 2018, o Compacto Lusófono é uma plataforma de investimento e uma parceria entre oito partes que se comprometem a contribuir para acelerar o crescimento do setor privado e o desenvolvimento de infraestruturas nos PALOP. O mecanismo resulta da parceria do BAD, Portugal e PALOP, tendo a adesão do Brasil - o único dos acionistas de língua portuguesa do banco africano que ainda não tinha assinado o Compacto Lusófono -- sido concretizada há cerca de um mês. \"O Brasil traz isso na área da agricultura, na área de transformação e também em termos de tecnologias para as energias renováveis. Como sabe, nós, o banco, temos esse setor como prioritário e aí é que nós vemos o Brasil como um parceiro interessante para dinamizar o Compacto Lusófono e também os países de língua oficial portuguesa\", acrescentou Neima Ferreira, no final de uma reunião, à margem dos encontros anuais do BAD na capital do Quénia, com os parceiros deste mecanismo de financiamento. O Compacto Lusófono conta ainda com uma garantia ao financiamento do Estado português, em que Neima Ferreira assume o objetivo de \"dinamizar mais\" a utilização, esperando a sua renovação por parte do Governo de Luís Montenegro. \"Portugal pôs à disposição uma garantia que nos permite dar mais apoio ao setor privado e, neste sentido, nós já estamos em processo de renovação e contamos com o novo Governo português. Nós vamos poder rapidamente pôr em prática a garantia\", garantiu. A parceria foi aprovada para cinco anos, de 2018 a 2023, e em dezembro chegaria ao fim, mas a orientação do comité diretor foi que gostaria de vê-lo continuar por 10 anos, e houve um acordo de princípio por parte do Governo de Portugal para continuar a apoiar, com a garantia financeira de 400 milhões de euros (percentual sobre a carteira de investimentos) para investimentos em projetos nos PALOP. \"Nós temos um projeto que foi apresentado do Banco, que foi apresentado ao Governo português, e houve pré-acordo. Agora cabe-nos a nós terminar as negociações com o setor privado, que beneficiou de 100 milhões de dólares de financiamento. Quando terminarmos essa negociação, vamos voltar ao Governo português para usar a garantia\", explicou, assumindo que o BAD conta neste processo com o apoio de Portugal: \"Claro, porque nós temos mais projetos\". Sobre a possibilidade de alargamento do Compacto a outros países, a responsável descartou essa possibilidade na perspetiva de beneficiários. \"Nós estamos abertos a receber outros países, mas como parceiros (...). O Compacto é uma iniciativa para promover a língua e a cultura que nós partilhamos em conjunto (...) e, neste sentido, só os países da língua oficial portuguesa podem ser membros do Compacto lusófono\", disse. Ainda assim, admitiu que \"outros países podem ser parceiros\", com \"instrumentos que possam ajudar no desenvolvimento do setor privado nos PALOP\": \"É neste sentido que nós queremos trabalhar e convidamos outros países para também fazerem parte dessa iniciativa que está a ter uma dinâmica muito forte\".

        "description": "O futebolista Salvador Agra estendeu recentemente contrato com o Boavista por mais uma temporada, a...",
        "content": "\"F alta-me ganhar [uma taça]. Depois de tantos anos, ganhar algo com este clube seria o maior troféu da minha carreira. É notório que todos queremos dar uma alegria grande a estes adeptos, tal como demos na última partida, mas com um sentimento diferente. É o objetivo que tenho enquanto cá estiver\", fixou o avançado, em entrevista à agência Lusa. Salvador Agra, de 32 anos, deixou o Tondela, então recém-despromovido à II Liga, para rumar ao Boavista no verão de 2022, juntando seis golos e oito assistências nos 69 jogos realizados nas últimas duas épocas, com o estatuto de habitual titular no corredor direito. \"Razões para ficar? O amor por este clube e a identificação com esta gente. Vejo por cá aquilo que me fez apaixonar por este trabalho. Quando assim é, estou feliz\", salientou o extremo, cujo vínculo terminava em junho, mas foi prolongado por mais uma temporada. Depois de terem finalizado a edição 2022/23 da I Liga na nona posição, os 'axadrezados' averbaram a classificação (15.o posto) e produção (32 pontos) mais baixas desde a sua reintegração administrativa na elite, em 2014/15, sofrendo até ao fim na fuga ao play-off. \"Este ano foi atípico e não queremos voltar a passar por isso, porque este clube tem de lutar por outros patamares e olhar para novos horizontes. Mudar [em 2024/25] passa por arrepiar caminho desde o início e manter esse nível. Como jogador, consigo controlar as minhas exibições, saber se estive melhor ou pior e efetuar uma análise quando as coisas nem correm bem. As outras situações deixo-as para quem as sabe tratar e bem\", disse o terceiro jogador mais utilizado esta temporada pela equipa do Bessa, com 34 encontros. Com passagens prévias no campeonato ao serviço de Olhanense (2011/12), Sporting de Braga (2013 e 2014/15), Académica (2014), Nacional (2015-2017), Desportivo das Aves (2017/18) e Tondela (2020-2022), Salvador Agra soma quase uma década e meia como futebolista profissional e admite ser um exemplo para a juventude do plantel do Boavista. \"Eles já me vão conhecendo e sabem que eu sou sempre mais um para ajudar. Também sei ver quais são aqueles momentos em que eles precisam de um carinho ou um grito. A malta que subiu da nossa formação sabe entender que tem de ter respeito para com um capitão. Há que manter essa mística, porque foi o que levou o Boavista a ter sucesso no passado e a ser o clube que é hoje\", notou o extremo, inserido no atual lote de capitães. Em função da escassez de opções do emblema do Bessa, Salvador Agra jogou algumas vezes adaptado a lateral direito, recuperando um papel desempenhado anteriormente na carreira, durante a qual chegou a constar dos quadros do Benfica (2017-2019) - sem ter somado minutos ao serviço do conjunto principal -, arrebatou uma Taça de Portugal pelo Desportivo das Aves (2017/18) e foi campeão da Polónia pelo Legia Varsóvia (2019/20).

        "description": "O experiente defesa central João Paulo, que passou por Sporting e FC Porto, terminou a carreira \"por...",
        "content": "\"E u deixo o futebol praticamente por questões familiares. Os meus colegas e a minha esposa estão tristes e queriam que eu continuasse -- e penso que teria ainda condições para continuar -, mas chegou a hora. Já tinha ponderado há alguns anos e acho que é o momento certo. Queria acabar bem, não a arrastar-me\", contou, em entrevista à Lusa. João Paulo colocou um ponto final a uma carreira de 25 anos enquanto sénior, iniciada no União de Leiria, com passagens por União de Tomar, Sporting, FC Porto e Vitória de Guimarães, atuando no estrangeiro, por Rapid Bucareste (Roménia), Le Mans (França), Omonia, Apollon Limassol e AEL Limassol (Chipre), antes de rumar ao futebol distrital. \"O sentimento é de dever cumprido. Tenho a noção de que me esforcei ao máximo em todos os clubes por onde passei, para os poder projetar da melhor forma. Deito todos os dias a cabeça na almofada com esse sentimento, sem dúvida nenhuma\", expressou. Prova disso foi nunca se ter deixado deslumbrar em plantéis repletos de 'craques', que acabaram por vingar no futebol, como os casos dos jovens Cristiano Ronaldo e Ricardo Quaresma, com quem alinhou nos 'leões' e, com o segundo, igualmente nos 'dragões'. \"Felizmente, sempre tive os pés assentes na terra. Fui dando um passo de cada vez e nunca meti as coisas muito altas. Como profissional levava as coisas muito a sério, mas também sabia a qualidade que havia nas equipas. Quanto maior fosse a equipa, mais qualidade havia. Não me arrependo de nada e foi tudo bom. Houve opções que podia ter feito de maneira diferente, com certeza, mas agora não dá para voltar atrás\", disse. Aos 36 anos, João Paulo saiu do principal escalão cipriota e retornou a Portugal devido a um problema de saúde da esposa, o que proporcionou um convite de um amigo para ir \"fazer umas brincadeiras\" ao Marinhense, do campeonato distrital de Leiria, no qual ficou três temporadas, a que se seguiram mais cinco no Castrense, da distrital de Beja. \"Ter ido para a distrital foi a melhor decisão que tive nos últimos tempos. Adorei jogar na distrital de Leiria e de Beja. Vai custar-me, mas tenho a vantagem de as pessoas de Castro Verde gostarem muito de mim -- e é recíproco -- e vão deixar-me estar algumas vezes no balneário, que é a parte que mais gosto. Já não desfrutava muito da parte do treino, tinha muitas dores. Foi a melhor altura, mas continuo a ir ao balneário\", frisou. Nestas 'aventuras' no futebol distrital, João Paulo chegou mesmo a trocar o centro da defesa pelo ataque, uma mudança que \"correu bem\", facilitado pela experiência e em saber \"como os centrais pisavam\", num escalão onde considera haver muita qualidade. \"Apanhei jogadores de qualidade que, por uma coisa ou outra, não tiveram as mesmas oportunidades que eu tive. Ainda agora no Castrense, há lá pelo menos dois jogadores que, se tivessem sido trabalhados, têm ali qualquer coisa de diferente. Podiam ter sido profissionais de futebol e isso encontra-se em várias equipas\", notou o veterano atleta. Finda a carreira, João Paulo pretende agora \"estar um pouco perto da família\" e usar o tempo em casa \"para dar um apoio\" à esposa, embora já tenha recebido convites por parte dos responsáveis do Castrense para continuar envolvido com a equipa principal. \"No clube convidaram-me para ser diretor desportivo, mas só me meto nas coisas de cabeça. Para ser diretor desportivo, tinha de acompanhar a equipa a toda a hora, mas para isso eu continuava a fazer o que queria, que era jogar. Nesta fase, tenho de estar um pouco perto da família e dar um apoio à minha esposa\", sentenciou o desportista. Partilhe a notícia PUB Seguro de vida: Não está seguro da sua decisão?

        "content": "\"O que faltou foi ter representado a seleção A. Infelizmente, não consegui. Estive na seleção B com o Scolari, na altura, mas nunca consegui ser internacional A. É o desejo de qualquer futebolista\", expressou o experiente defesa central, em entrevista à Lusa. Pela equipa das 'quinas', João Paulo alinhou nos Jogos Olímpicos Atenas2004 e no Europeu de sub-21, no mesmo ano, quando representava o União de Leiria, clube em que se destacou ainda em início de carreira, entrando nas cogitações de Luiz Felipe Scolari. \"Estava em Leiria, as coisas estavam a correr-me bem. Sei que o Scolari foi a Leiria ver-me jogar e eu não joguei esse jogo por acumulação de amarelos ou por alguma lesão. Era capitão na altura, fui ao balneário antes do jogo e, quando entro no elevador, qual não foi o meu espanto ao ver o 'mister' Scolari. O presidente não sabia que não podia jogar. Sei que estive prestes a ir, mas depois apareceu o Pepe. Foi na altura em que foi naturalizado e ele tinha mais qualidade do que eu, não dá para esconder isso\", contou. No ano seguinte, João Paulo foi para o FC Porto e ficou mesmo na 'sombra' de Pepe na primeira época, antes de o central, atualmente nos 'dragões', rumar aos espanhóis do Real Madrid, e apontou como pináculo da carreira jogar na Liga dos Campeões. \"Jogar na Liga dos Campeões é o ponto mais alto da minha carreira. Agora, em termos de número de jogos, não foi o que esperava, como é óbvio. Contudo, deu para sentir o clube que era e viver novas realidades que não tinha vivido até então\", frisou também. Já na segunda época nos portuenses, João Paulo aumentou o tempo de jogo, devido a uma lesão de Pedro Emanuel, recordando um momento \"ingrato\" que lamentou pela forma como voltou a ser afastado da equipa, apesar das boas prestações que efetuou. \"Joguei na Liga dos Campeões contra o Liverpool, marquei um golo em Leiria e, depois, vamos jogar a Fátima para a Taça da Liga, em que perdemos nos penáltis. Nos minutos iniciais, houve um canto a favor do FC Porto, o guarda-redes soca-me o nariz e fiquei a jogar com ele partido. Sou operado no fim do jogo e, quando regresso, quero treinar e não me deixaram. O futebol é um pouco ingrato e sei que o nome João Paulo não me fez jogar. Se o nome fosse diferente, eu tinha jogado, mesmo com a máscara\", realçou. Apesar de alguma 'mágoa', João Paulo lembrou ainda uma frase de Pinto da Costa, que lhe disse que provou ser \"um jogador à FC Porto\", e revelou ter recebido uma proposta de um clube inglês, antes de jogar os campeonatos da Roménia, de França e do Chipre. \"Joguei em países em que nunca pensei jogar. Fiquei com muita pena de não ter ficado no Rapid Bucareste. É uma cidade fantástica, adeptos fervorosos e gosto de pressão. Por isso é que adorei jogar no Vitória de Guimarães. Essa pena só durou meia dúzia de semanas, pois apareceu logo o campeonato francês, onde não há um estádio que não esteja completamente preenchido e as condições de trabalho, mesmo no Le Mans, são de equipa grande. Ao Chipre ainda costumamos lá ir todos os anos de férias\", resumiu. João Paulo, que, exceto o Sporting, integrou o leque de capitães em todas as equipas que representou -- União de Leiria, União de Tomar, FC Porto, Rapid Bucareste, Le Mans, Vitória de Guimarães, Omonia, Apollon Limassol, AEL Limassol, Marinhense e Castrense -, falou da passagem nos 'leões', com um miúdo chamado Cristiano Ronaldo. \"Eu, o Quaresma e o Ronaldo andávamos praticamente sempre juntos. Havia vontade, ele acabava os treinos e ficava com uma bola no campo. Esperava que os mais velhos tomassem banho para ficar a ver-se ao espelho, num trabalho de ginásio que já o fazia. Ele pedia ao treinador de guarda-redes para cruzar umas bolas, porque um dos pontos fracos dele na altura era o jogo aéreo. Evoluiu em tudo e tudo o que alcançou é mérito dele, pois trabalhou imenso para isso\", referiu, em relação ao 'astro' luso, de 39 anos.

        "content": "Ranchi: पीएम नरेंद्र मोदी ने दुमका में मंगलवार को एनडीए कैंडिडेट निशिकांत दुबे (गोड्डा), सीता सोरेन (दुमका) और ताला मरांडी (राजमहल) को लोकसभा चुनाव में जीत दिलाने की अपील की. दुमका में आयोजित महा विजय संकल्प सभा में अपने संबोधन में कहा कि कांग्रेस, झामुमो गठबंधन जब भी सत्ता में आया, आदिवासी समाज और उसकी संस्कृति खतरे में पड़ गयी. नक्सलवाद, तुष्टीकरण फलता फूलता रहा. होनहार बच्चों का जीवन बर्बाद होता रहा. नक्सलवाद की आग में सबसे ज्यादा आदिवासी परिवार जला. अब झारखंड में घुसपैठ बढ़ा है जिससे संकट भी बढ़ा है. खासकर संतालपरगना में यह ज्यादा है. कई इलाकों में आदिवासियों की संख्या घटी है जबकि घुसपैठियों की बढ़ी है. वे जमीन पर कब्जा कर रहे हैं. बेटियों की सुरक्षा खतरे में है. उनके 50-50 टुकड़े हो रहे. जिंदा जला दिया जा रहा है. मोदी ने सवाल करते कहा कि आखिर क्यों झामुमो सरकार इन्हें पाल पोस रही है. मौके पर दुमका, राजमहल और गोड्डा के कैंडिडेट के अलावा प्रदेश अध्यक्ष बाबूलाल मरांडी, नेता प्रतिपक्ष अमर कुमार बाउरी सहित अन्य भी उपस्थित थे. मोदी ने कहा कि 2014 में भाजपा को जनता का आशीर्वाद मिला था. 2014 से पहले तक कांग्रेसी शासन में रोज-रोज की लूट से जनता त्रस्त हो गयी थी. हर दिन घोटाले हो रहे थे. कांग्रेस गरीबों के नाम पर पैसे लूटने का काम कर रही थी. लेकिन जब भाजपा की सरकार बनी तो कांग्रेस की इस लूट पर पाबंदी लगा दी गयी. कहा कि उनके आने के बाद 4 करोड़ जनता का पक्का मकान बना, गैस कनेक्शन महिलाओं को दिया, गांव-गांव बिजली दी गयी. इन योजनाओं से सबसे ज्यादा लाभ गरीबों को हुआ. गरीबों के जीवन में बदलाव आया और उनकी परेशानी कम हुई. पिछले 10 वर्षों के काम को आगे बढ़ाना है. 3 करोड़ माताओं, बहनों को लखपति बनाने का लक्ष्य तय किया गया है. अगले 5 वर्ष में 3 करोड़ और पक्के मकान बनेंगे. उन्होंने कहा कि भाजपा के कार्यकर्ता जिस किसी भी गांव में जाये तो वहां एक- एक गरीब और कच्चे मकान में रहने वाले की जानकारी सीधा पीएम कार्यालय में भेज दे. आगे सबको पक्का मकान दिया जाएगा. उन्होंने कहा कि जनता को बिजली बिल न देना पड़े, इसके लिए पीएम सौर योजना शुरू की गयी है. इस योजना के तहत हर घर पर सोलर लगाने के लिए 75 हजार रुपये सरकार देगी. उससे जो बिजली पैदा होगी, उससे जनता का बिल शून्य होगा. ज्यादा बिजली होगी तो सरकार उसे खरीद कर जनता के खाते में सीधा पैसा देगी. कांग्रेस, झामुमो, राजद पर हमला बोलते कहा कि वे खुले आम धमकी दे रहे हैं कि मोदी को हटाना है ताकि फिर से उन्हें घोटाला करने का मौका मिल सके. झारखंड बहुत खूबसूरत है लेकिन इसकी चर्चा पहाड़ों के कारण नहीं बल्कि नोट के पहाड़ों के कारण हो रही है. वे स्वयं 13 वर्ष मुख्यमंत्री रहे. अभी पीएम हैं पर कभी नोटों का पहाड़ नहीं देखा था. पहली बार टीवी पर देखा था. कांग्रेस, जेएमएम के नेताओं के घर से जो पैसे मिल रहे हैं, वो पैसे खान खनिज घोटाला, शराब घोटाला, बालू घोटाला ट्रांसफर पोस्टिंग के माध्यम से आया है. झारखंड सरकार में शामिल लोग अपने पिता का नाम बदल कर जमीन घोटाला कर रहे. आदिवासियों ही नहीं, यहां तक कि सेना की जमीन तक पर कब्जा कर लिया है. झारखंड सरकार ने जल जीवन मिशन योजना, मुफ्त राशन योजना तक में घोटाला कर लिया. लेकिन इन पर कार्रवाई नहीं होती. लेकिन गरीब के अन्न, पानी मोदी सरकार किसी को लूटने नहीं देगी. पीएम ने कहा कि 4 जून के बाद भ्रष्टाचार पर कार्रवाई तेज होगी, ये मोदी की गारंटी है. भाजपा गरीब, दलित, वंचित, आदिवासी के लिए समर्पित है, सेवा भाव से काम करती है. आदिवासी विकास के लिए भाजपा ने 4 गुना फंड को बढ़ाया है. आदिवासी क्षेत्र में विकास हो, इसके लिए कानून बनाया है. लेकिन कांग्रेस ने आदिवासियों का नुकसान किया है. इंडी जमात ने आदिवासी बेटी को राष्ट्रपति बनने से रोकने को पूरी ताकत झोंक दी थी. भारत में रविवार को सार्वजनिक छुट्टी होती थी लेकिन झारखंड सरकार ने संथाल में शुक्रवार को सार्वजनिक छुट्टी कर दी है. इंडी गठबंधन अलगाववादी को संरक्षण दे रही है. मुस्लिम को आरक्षण दे रहे हैं. बाबा साहेब ने जो अधिकार संविधान के माध्यम से एससी, एसटी और ओबीसी को आरक्षण दिया है, उसे वे किसी को छीनने नहीं देंगे. कांग्रेस कहती है कि मोदी हिन्दू- मुसलमान कर रहा है. इन्हें लगता है कि मोदी पर कीचड़ उछालने से मोदी डर जाएगा लेकिन इंडी गठबंधन जितना कीचड़ उन पर उछालेगा, उतना कमल देश में खिलेगा. उन्होंने कहा कि इंडी गठबंधन लिखित में दे कि देश के एससी, एसटी, ओबीसी का आरक्षण नहीं खत्म करेंगे. मुस्लिम को ओबीसी नहीं बनाएंगे, लेकिन कुछ भी इस मामले पर इंडी गठबंधन नहीं कह रहा. पीएम ने कहा कि मोदी आपकी तरह ही गरीब परिवार में पैदा हो कर आपके बीच आया है. इसलिए जिस गरीब क्षेत्र में विकास नहीं हो रहा था, वहां विकास कर रहे हैं. झारखंड के संथाल परगना में विकास हो रहा है. देवघर में एम्स, साहेबगंज में गंगा पुल बन रहा है. युवाओं को नए अवसर मिलेंगे. विकास की यह क्रांति आप जनता के एक वोट से मिलेगी जो आपका और आपके बच्चों का भविष्य बदलेगा. इसलिए गोड्डा, राजमहल और दुमका लोकसभा से कमल पर वोट कर भाजपा को मजबूत करें.",

        "content": "El entrenador candidato al banquillo del Almería ha pedido tiempo a Turki antes de tomar una decisión para firmar el mejor contrato de su vida, a la espera de una llamada de Primera División que se antoja complicada ya que solo quedan tres equipos de la máxima categoría sin entrenador. Osasuna ya es pasado para el técnico catalán y salta la lista a Las Palmas, Real Mallorca, Sevilla y Rayo Vallecano . Son solo tres banquillos vacantes pero con condiciones ya que en Mallorca es Arrasate el mejor colocado para sustituir a Javier Aguirre. En las Palmas se busca un entrenador emergente para suplir la baja de García Pimienta y el Rayo no lo tiene claro con la continuidad de Iñigo Pérez. Lo del Sevilla requiere unos riesgos que igual no estaría dispuesto a sumirlos el firme candidato al banquillo del Almería. El tiempo que pide Rubi a Turki Al-Sheikh estaría en función de alcanzar el banquillo de uno de los clubes que están buscando relevo y no parece ser Rubi el mejor colocado a día de hoy. No se entiende que el preparador catalán se lo tome con calma ante el contrato de su vida. Turki no es de los que le gusta esperar pero tendrá tacto con el catalán ya que tiene buena sintonía con él y ha sido el elegido. El catalán lleva la Primera en la cabeza y lo mismo no sale bien firmar en Segunda con el Almería por aquello de las segundas partes y la presión que acarrea dirigir al club rojiblanco. El tiempo que pide Rubi al Almería juega a su favor ya que si alguno de los clubes de Primera le contratan igual sacrificaría dinero de Arabia por regresar a LaLiga. Es una decisión firme la del catalán que no parece inquietarle el poder económico del Almería y prefiere ser fiel a su decisión meditada a lo largo de toda una campaña viendo fútbol de Primera y menos de Segunda. Entrenar al Almería tiene sus riesgos y pese a que Rubi cobraría todo lo firmado, prefiere el catalán estar plenamente convencido antes de dar el OK. Espera Lo único claro a día de hoy es que Rubi es el entrenador pretendido por el Almería y que el catalán prefiere dirigir en Primera. Solo quedan cuatro banquillos libres y no ha sonado para ninguno de ellos. Los equipos sin entrenador tienen otros planes y lo mismo en los planes del catalán está lograr llamar la atención de estas entidades y que llegue una buena oferta para entrenar en Primera. Hay mucho en juego para Rubi a la hora de tomar una decisión y está en su derecho de tomarse tiempo por si llega la llamada de un Primera División. Dinero Queda claro que en la decisión de Rubi está por encima de todo el proyecto deportivo. El dinero no es lo principal ya que el Almería le ha valorado como si de un entrenador de Primera División se tratase y le pone encima de la mesa un contrato irrechazable. Nunca antes le han ofrecido tanto dinero al catalán por dirigir a un club y pese a ser irrechazable la oferta se lo quiere pensar ya que las segundas partes en los clubes no siempre salen y se le va a exigir mucho desde la primera jornada y se le va recordar todo lo que firme. Exigencia Si el catalán no ha dado aún el visto bueno a la oferta del Almería es por lo que implica entrenar a un club como el Almería. No es uno más de LaLiga y pese a que le darán galones para elegir a futbolistas (no todos) desde que firme su contrato tendrá todo el peso de la responsabilidad y la obligación de alcanzar un nuevo ascenso a Primera División. Entrenar en Almería no es tan bonito como parece y lo sabe de primera mano el entrenador catalán que pese a tener encima de la mesa el contrato de su vida, sabe que en fútbol nada te garantiza repetir éxitos pasados. Se juega mucho Rubi en su decisión.",

        "content": "Нападающий сборной Франции по футболу Килиан Мбаппе приобрел особняк в фешенебельном районе Мадрида, который ранее принадлежал бывшему игроку \"Реала\" валлийцу Гарету Бэйлу , сообщают Vesti.kz со ссылкой на Le Parisien. Ранее в СМИ писали, что Мбаппе купил дом в районе Ла Моралеха. В нем находятся резиденции экс-футболистов \"Реала\" Криштиану Роналду , Серхио Рамоса и Карима Бензема . Однако, по данным источника, Мбаппе отказался от идеи покупки особняка в данной местности и выбрал дом в Ла Финке, который ранее принадлежал Бэйлу, выступавшему за \"сливочных\" с 2013 по 2022 год. Район считается одним из самых безопасных в Мадриде, в нем проживают нынешние футболисты \"Реала\". Покупка Мбаппе оценивается в несколько миллионов евро. Ранее Мбаппе объявил об уходе из \"Пари Сен-Жермен\" по окончании сезона. При этом 25-летний футболист не сообщил, в каком клубе он продолжит карьеру. Ожидается, что француз перейдет в \"Реал\" и подпишет с мадридским клубом контракт сроком на пять лет, по которому будет зарабатывать от 15 до 20 миллионов евро за сезон. Мбаппе отказался переходить в \"Реал\" и выбрал другой клуб Напомним, Мбаппе выступал за ПСЖ с 2017 года. За это время он сыграл в составе парижан 308 матчей, забил 256 голов, сделал 108 результативных передач. Вместе с ПСЖ форвард шесть раз выиграл чемпионат Франции, четыре раза - Кубок страны, трижды - Суперкубок Франции и дважды - Кубок французской лиги.",

Таким мнением поделился с корреспондентом политолог , комментируя информацию о том, что в структурах Евросоюза обсуждается возможность «мирного саммита» с участием России по украинскому конфликту. Основанная на так называемой «формуле Зеленского» мирная конференция по украинской проблематике в Швейцарии, которая запланирована на 15–16 июня, почти никого в мире уже не волнует, убеждён эксперт. Ясно, что без участия России, учитывая реалии, это мероприятие бесперспективно. Более того, как указал политолог, на конференцию не приедут и первые лица США и других стран. , — прокомментировал Межуев. Сейчас единственным реалистичным вариантом выглядит «заморозка» конфликта по линии боевого соприкосновения, заметил собеседник . Но Россия по сути уже предложила такой вариант, и киевский режим его однозначно отверг, напомнил эксперт. Что же в таком случае может обсуждаться на «мирном саммите»? Очевидно, что реальный мирный процесс никак не может основываться на «швейцарском», без участия России, инициированном коллективным Западом. Ясно также, что обеспечить реальную перспективу серьёзного мирного урегулирования украинского конфликта может лишь дальнейшее синхронное давление армии России на поле боя и дипломатическое давление на международных площадках, убеждён политолог. Евросоюз хочет организовать в Саудовской Аравии осенью нынешнего года саммит, посвящённый , с участием России. Об этом сообщило агентство Bloomberg со ссылкой на свои источники. Уточняется, что министры иностранных дел стран ЕС обсудят 27 мая, как найти приемлемый исход для саммита в Швейцарии, намеченного на 15–16 июня, который пройдёт без участия российской стороны. При этом ЕС будет стремиться разрешить важную проблему перехода от этой конференции к возможной мирной встрече осенью уже с участием России. Как сообщало , 15–16 июня в Швейцарии пройдёт так называемая по ситуации на Украине. Швейцарская сторона пригласила по просьбе киевского режима более 160 делегаций. Россия на мероприятие не приглашена.

        "content": "Sally Nugent issues warning to Jon Kay on BBC Breakfast BBC Breakfast star Carol Kirkwood shut down Jon Kay during the latest instalment of the programme. On Tuesday (May 28) Jon returned to the red sofa, while Sally Nugent joined him following her absence on Monday. During the show, Jon and Sally discussed some of the \"wild activities\" which took place over the Bank Holiday weekend. This included the woolsack race which took place in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. The Tetbury Woolsack Races are an annual sporting event where competitors must race up and down the steepest street in the town carrying a full woolsack on their back, some of which weighed more than 60 pounds. Jon, 54, quipped: \"I wonder what's worse on your knees? I think coming down would be worse, wouldn't it?\" Sally declared: \"Both bad!\" READ MORE... BBC's Abbie Dewhurst announces departure after eight years as weather presenter [LATEST] Sally Nugent shut down Jon Kay's suggestion about taking part in a woolsack race (Image: BBC) This wasn't the only event taking place in Gloucestershire as there was also the annual cheese rolling race. This sees competitors chase a Double Gloucester down a steep hill - but often results in those racing falling and tumbling down. Earlier in the programme, Jon suggested he and Sally should tackle the event - an idea she immediately rejected. The news reader later said of the woolsack race: \"Shall we do that as well next year as well as the cheese rolling?\" The 52-year-old wasn't keen on the idea as she responded: \"No! Will you stop suggesting all these things that we might do, someone will pay attention and make us do it.\" Don't miss...

However, the meteorologist immediately shut down the idea. \"You are joking?\" she said. \"Not in a million years!\" Sally was replaced by Nina Warhurst following her unexplained absence on Monday (May 27). Viewers were quick to praise Nina as they begged bosses to make her role more permanent. One wrote: \"Hello @BBCBreakfast. I think you should give Nina Warhurst a full-time role on the programme, she’s too good and not on enough for my liking. #BBCBreakfast\". Another added: “Totally agree with you, she's so natural, a brilliant presenter.\" A third penned: \"Tuned into #BBCBreakfast this morning. Looks like Sally has decided she cannot work a bank holiday. Oh well!

При этом каждый четвертый хотел бы видеть в своей ленте больше постов с подобными роликами. Такие данные приводятся в исследовании «ВКонтакте». Опрос пользователей и анализ трендов потребления контента в клипах, видео, историях, музыке и других форматах постов показал, что поколение миллениалов чаще смотрит клипы в 7-8 часов утра, а зумеры — перед сном, в 9-10 часов вечера. Другие виды контента также сохраняют востребованность. Например, 64 процента пользователей смотрят посты с фото и картинками, 69 процентов — часто слушают музыку, 46 процентов юзеров ежедневно публикуют сторис. В них заметен тренд на «Бьютифай» — использование масок со сглаживающим эффектом, цифрового макияжа и загара. В разных форматах контента аудитория предпочитает разные темы. В коротких роликах люди отдают предпочтение пародиям на известных личностей, неудачным дублям и забавным танцам. При этом темы «юмор» и «животные» часто сочетаются друг с другом и порождают вирусные клипы. В длинных же видео любовью зрителей пользуются кино и сериалы. Среди изображений востребованы снимки в формате «Было/стало», фотографии звезд, мемы с красных дорожек, подборки красивых пейзажей, эстетика ностальгии по 90-м, а также уютные дома на природе. Во всех типах контента пользователей интересуют фудблогинг, путешествия, психология. Люди чаще всего рассматривают соцсеть в качестве основного источника информации о брендах, контенте, авторах. В среднем активный пользователь подписан на 121 сообщество, среди которых паблики по интересам и региональные порталы. При этом чаще всего пользователи не обращают внимания на размер аудитории понравившегося канала. Ранее координационный совет подвел итоги первого этапа грантовой программы VK.",

        "content": "Dortmund – Ein 26-jähriger Mann wurde gestern Abend (27. Mai) bei einer Auseinandersetzung auf der Kampstraße durch einen Messerstich in den Rücken schwer verletzt. Freunde des 26-Jährigen wurden gegen 18.10 Uhr auf der Kampstraße von dem Täter in arabischer Sprache angesprochen und bedroht, wobei auch der Einsatz eines Messers angedroht wurde. Der 26-Jährige, der ebenfalls Arabisch spricht, ging dazwischen und wurde daraufhin sofort mit Pfefferspray ins Gesicht gesprüht. Kurz darauf erlitt er einen Messerstich im oberen Rückenbereich. Der Täter flüchtete in unbekannte Richtung. Der 26-Jährige wurde schwer, aber nicht lebensgefährlich verletzt und mit einem Rettungswagen in ein Krankenhaus gebracht. Der flüchtige Täter wird wie folgt beschrieben: etwa 170 cm groß, 17-18 Jahre alt, weißes Oberteil, dunkle Hose, roter Schal als Kopfbedeckung und nordafrikanischer Phänotyp. Hinweise nimmt die Kriminalwache unter der Telefonnummer 0231/132-7441 entgegen. Dieser Text basiert auf einer offiziellen Behörden-Information und wurde mit Hilfe von KI erstellt.",

        "content": "MITRE heeft over het hack op het eigen netwerk. De aanvallers bleven maanden onopgemerkt en de analyse geeft meer inzicht in de werkwijze van de aanvallers om dit mogelijk te maken. Rogue VM’s Zo blijkt dat er rogue virtual machines (VM’s) werden opgezet. De VM’s bleken niet op de radars van beheerders te verschijnen doordat de aanvallers ze direct op de hypervisor aanmaakten en beheerden. MITRE gebruikt wel de beheeroplossing vCenter voor het beheer van VM’s, maar de hackers konden daar langs af gaan door de VM’s rechtstreeks op service-accounts op de hypervisor aan te maken. Het originele punt van toegang bleek een gecompromitteerd admin-account te zijn. Dat was mogelijk door de uitbuiting van twee zero-day-kwetsbaarheden in Ivanti Connect Secure. Op die manier omzeilden de hackers de multifactor authenticatie. De aanvallers kregen daardoor toegang tot VMware-infrastructuur. Toch verschenen de aangemaakte VM’s ook niet op de ESXi-webinterface. De analyse geeft daar dezelfde verklaring voor. MITRE geeft aan dat er speciale tools en technieken nodig zijn om rogue VM’s te ontdekken. Chinese hackers Het bedrijf heeft daarnaast officieel vastgesteld dat de hackers van Chinese origine zijn. Daar waren eerder reeds vermoedens over. De hackers zouden het gemunt hebben op de Amerikaanse overheid, waar MITRE als not-for-profitorganisatie op verschillende vlakken ondersteuning aan levert.",

        "content": "Франция направит в Украину своих инструкторов для подготовки украинских военнослужащих. Об этом сообщил главнокомандующий ВСУ Александр Сырский по итогам онлайн-встречи с министром обороны Франции Себастьяном Лекорню. По словам Сырского, он подписал документы, которые позволят первым французским инструкторам посетить украинские учебные центры и «ознакомиться с их инфраструктурой и персоналом». «Верю, что решительность Франции побуждает других партнеров присоединиться к этому амбициозному проекту», — говорится в телеграм-канале Сырского. Минобороны Франции в комментарии агентству Reuters сообщило, что обучение украинских военных на территории Украины — один из обсуждаемых проектов, который появился после конференции европейских государств 26 февраля 2024 года. «Это направление продолжает быть предметом работы с украинцами, в частности, для того, чтобы понять их точные потребности», — добавили в военном ведомстве. В Минобороны Украины после заявления Александра Сырского сообщили, что дискуссии с Францией и другими странами по вопросу отправки иностранных инструкторов «до сих пор продолжаются». «Минобороны совместно с Генштабом начали внутреннюю работу над соответствующими документами по этому вопросу, чтобы не тратить время на согласование бюрократических моментов, когда будет принято соответствующее решение», — говорится в сообщении украинского военного ведомства. В конце февраля президент Франции Эммануэль Макрон допустил возможность отправки европейских войск в Украину, отметив, что консенсуса по этому вопросу нет. Позже он пояснил, что «не исключать чего-то — не означает делать это». Генеральный секретарь НАТО Йенс Столтенберг после этого заявил, что союзники по альянсу оказывают Украине «беспрецедентную поддержку», но никаких планов по размещению боевых подразделений НАТО в Украине у них нет. В начале мая Макрон заявил: «Если бы русские прорвали линию фронта, если бы поступила просьба Украины — чего сегодня нет, — мы бы на законных основаниях должны были задать себе этот вопрос [об отправке войск]». Пресс-секретарь президента России Дмитрий Песков заявлял, что в случае отправки войск стран НАТО в Украину конфликт между РФ и альянсом станет неизбежным. Немецкая газета Welt am Sonntag писала, что в согласованных послами 27 стран Евросоюза гарантиях безопасности для Украины исключается прямое участие военных стран ЕС в боевых действиях против России.",

A cápákhoz pedig evoBuild termékcsaládjuk egyikét adták alapanyagul, mely maga is 10 százakban újrahasznosított alapanyagokból készült. Kolodko Mihály csaknem öt éve Kisvácon él, három szobra is fellelhető a város terein, a mostani projektjében azonban egészen újat alkotott.

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – It is a well-known fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been the ‘flavor of the month’ for every month of the past decade. From chat-bots and personalized shopping applications to autonomous vehicles and flying taxis, companies are trying their luck with AI everywhere. We however know this is just the beginning of AI. The full potential of AI for reshaping urban landscapes cannot be harnessed without a supportive government providing the right infrastructure and regulations, a co-operative and symbiotic relationship between public and private entities and a conductive AI start-up and scale-up ecosystem. Dubai stands out as a great textbook example to draw inspiration from. Since 2000, Dubai has become a global leader in the e-Government sphere, harnessing the power of technology to enhance and optimize efficiency and performance in the public sector. As a result of the adoption of the Government Resources Platform Systems platform for all government entities and reduced duplication of efforts, Dubai Government saved over USD 1.3 Billion between 2003 and 2015. In 2021, Dubai achieved its ambitions outlined under the Dubai Paperless Strategy as 100% of government transactions became digital and completely paperless generating savings of over 757 thousand tons of CO2 emissions for Dubai, and helps annually save 39,000 trees, 13 Million Man Hours and over US$ 270 million. Since then, Digital Dubai, the government entity tasked with developing and overseeing the implementation of policies and strategies that govern all matters related to Dubai’s information technology, data and digital ecosystem, has shifted its focus from building a digital government to building a digital city, embracing emerging technologies and private sector partners achieve their goals, with AI becoming a key focus and pillar of that vision. Launched in 2023, the Dubai Centre for Artificial Intelligence, The Centre is Dubai’s answer to the rapid technological change as the government adopts new systems to test innovative AI technologies and harness them for benefit of society with the aim of making a real impact. The Centre is creating a blueprint to propel the growth of generative AI applications in the city’s public sector. Taking Dubai’s AI ambitions one step further is DubaiAI, a ChatGPT powered digital city concierge, which is essentially the government’s flagship one-stop-shop app for all city services which hosts over 250 services from 35 government and semi government entities. Launched by Digital Dubai, DubaiAI provides valuable data about the city across variety of topics from both the government and private sector, including health, educations, tourism, investment and other sectors. The unique platform is creating a new model for fostering effective cooperation and futuristic ideas that will fast track sustainable economic growth and development in line with the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, which aims to contribute AED 100 billion (US$27.2 billion) annually to the city’s economy through digital transformation projects. Tasked with digitalizing life in Dubai and spearheading the AI-powered urban planning, Digital Dubai is also testing Robotic Process Automation tools in day-to-day administration tasks within the Human Resources, Finance and Procurement process of Dubai Government entities, ensuring greater efficiency and response times to government employees, citizens, residents and businesses. On a sector level, various government entities across Dubai are also embracing AI like never before as they adopt a predictive and progressive approach to enhancing efficiency and innovating. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), for example, has developed several innovations using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency of operations in Dubai’s water network, monitor cyberattacks, leaks and faults, and isolate and repair them immediately. On the other hand, robotics and automation are increasingly playing a bigger role in Dubai’s fast-growing healthcare sector, which is seeing a new wave of innovation-focused investment from public and private sector stakeholders. Notable use-cases include robotic-assisted surgeries, robotic pharmacy services, robotic telemedicine and AI-enabled biomedical research. Meanwhile, Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) is using new AI-powered tools to to monitor and assess the performance of delivery bike riders operating in Dubai, while it actively tests robotaxis and AI-powered police patrols and develops a prototype for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), all of which are expected to transform the city in the near future and elevate its status as a global smart city that is pioneering and embracing cutting-edge smart city technologies. As a city with its eye fixated on the future, Dubai has remained cognizant of the need to create a conducive and future-forward entrepreneurial ecosystem that enable young businesses to thrive and grow. Sandbox Dubai, among the key initiatives unveiled under D33, is a testament to Dubai’s vision of becoming a preferred market for innovative companies and entrepreneurs to test out and commercialize new technologies and cement the city’s status as a major innovation hub in the process. The growing number of accelerators surfacing across Dubai is an indicator of growing appeal and potential of the city’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. The Dubai Centre for AI’s Accelerator Programmes alone attracted 615 startups from 55 countries after its launch last year, supporting the development of AI-based solutions to current and future challenges. Meanwhile, Dubai International Financial Centre, Dubai’s financial free zone, launched a ground-breaking Artificial Intelligence (AI) and coding license in 2023 in cooperation with the UAE Artificial Intelligence Office. The license, which is a UAE first, will advance the country’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031, which aims to enhance the UAE’s reputation in this field by attracting AI companies and coders from around the world. Such progressive developments complement the competitive advantages that Dubai offers innovative AI startups and scaleups such as 100% foreign ownership, business-friendly regulatory environment, remote working visas and 5-year entrepreneurial visas, access to specialised tech talent and a maturing venture capital landscape, among many others. By prioritizing PPPs, building the regulations and policies for ecosystem growth, fostering AI scale-ups, and embracing the potential of AI and IoT, Dubai is not only shaping its own future but also offering a roadmap for other cities around the world that seek to leverage AI technologies and data as building blocks of hyper connectivity to connect government, business and all segments of society to expand its innovation ecosystem.",

        "content": "( ) shares have been having a tough time over the last 12 months. During this time, the supermarket giant's shares have lost about 18% of their value. This means that a $10,000 investment in Woolworths would now be worth approximately $8,200. Whereas over the same period, the ASX 200 index has risen by almost 8%. This would have turned a $10,000 investment into $10,800. That's a disappointing opportunity cost of $2,600 from investing in Woolworths shares. But could the worst be over? Is now the time for investors to snap up the retailer's shares while they are cheap? Well, Goldman Sachs certainly thinks it is. The broker sees significant value in its shares at the current level and has named a few reasons why it thinks investors should be investing today. 3 reasons Woolworths shares could be cheap One of the reasons that Goldman Sachs believes investors should be buying the company's shares is its customer loyalty. It notes that Woolworths has some of the highest consumer stickiness and loyalty among its peers. The broker expects this to drive market share gains. Another reason it is positive is the company's ability to pass on cost inflation. It believes this will protect Woolworths' margins more than the market currently anticipates. Finally, the broker highlights that Woolworths shares are trading at levels well below historical averages. Given its positive sales growth outlook, it feels this is unwarranted and has created a compelling buying opportunity. Goldman summarises: WOW is the largest supermarket chain in Australia with an additional presence in NZ, as well as selling general merchandise retail via Big W. We are Buy rated on the stock as we believe the business has among the highest consumer stickiness and loyalty among peers, and hence has strong ability to drive market share gains via its omni-channel advantage, as well as its ability to pass through any cost inflation to protect its margins, beyond market expectations. The stock is trading below its historical average (since 2018), and we see this as a value entry level for a high-quality and defensive stock. The broker currently has a conviction buy rating and $39.40 price target on its shares. Based on its current share price of $31.54, this implies potential upside of 25% for investors over the next 12 months. In addition, the broker is forecasting 3.4%+ from Woolworths shares through to at least FY 2026.",

        "content": "Waterford boss Davy Fitzgerald confronts referee Liam Gordon after their defeat to Clare on May 19. Photo: Inpho Davy Fitzgerald is facing a proposed four-week ban, arising out of his confrontation with referee Liam Gordon at the end of their Munster SHC round robin game with Clare in Ennis last Sunday week. Waterford received notification of the penalty last week ahead of their final Munster round-robin game against Limerick in the Gaelic Grounds. It is believed Clare have also received notice of a similar penalty for one of their backroom members who was involved in the exchanges. It follows an investigation by the Central Competitions Controls Committee (CCCC). The proposed penalty comes under Rule 7.2 (c), category 11a which covers abusive language towards a match official or disruptive conduct. If it's accepted or proved, it will make little difference to Fitzgerald with Waterford making their exit from the championship. If he stays on for a third year, he would have to sit out the opening game of next year's Munster Championship as a one-game suspension from the same competition is part of the penalty, even if that game falls outside the four weeks. But Fitzgerald is adamant that his words were not abusive towards Gordon as the official came off the field and that the confrontation was about the number of steps the Clare player Mark Rodgers took in the lead-up to his goal rather than a dispute over the 65 awarded to Clare late on that Rodgers converted to win the game. In a weekend interview with the Irish Times, he stressed that point. On a point of principle, he may elect to seek a hearing and challenge the proposed penalty. Fitzgerald was non-committal about staying on with Waterford after Sunday's defeat in the Gaelic Grounds. After failing to make the top flight in next year's seven-team Division 1A league, Waterford turned their season around with a win over Cork, but they let a lead slip against Tipperary for a draw that ultimately cost them advancement in the championship.",

        "description": "George never woke up, but he got to lie with his baby girl before his life support was turned off",
        "content": "This heartbreaking last photo shows a new dad meeting his baby daughter for the first time in hospital just before his life support machine was turned off. George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being injured on a night out in Blackpool, Lancs. His partner Beth Turner, 23, was heavily pregnant at the time and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died. While he never regained consciousness, he was able to meet his daughter in hospital and George's heartbroken mum Melissa captured the touching moment. Melissa, 53, said: \"Looking back now, I’m not sure how we all got through it, the range of emotions we had to go through was horrendous. Beth wanted Clara to meet George and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and she had a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she saw him everyday. “It was important that she did that because we’ve got memories, we’ve got pictures. The hospital did a lot, we’ve also got little prints of Clara’s and George’s hands together.” Police were called at around 2am on August 15 last year to a report of an assault at The Strand in Blackpool. They found George, a bartender at Revolution Bar, had suffered serious head injuries. He was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital and put on a life support machine but tragically died in hospital on November 22. An inquest opening heard George collapsed and lost consciousness. A post-mortem found his cause of death was complications of blunt head trauma. Melissa said of the ordeal: “We were all in shock, we weren’t sure what was happening. \"It was one of his friends who phoned, he said something had happened but no one was sure what. Then we heard George had gone to Royal Preston Hospital and we didn’t know why but when we got more information, we found out he had a serious head injury so Preston was the best place for him. “His girlfriend was six or seven months pregnant at that time so we were all just in shock and when we saw him it was pretty horrific.” Six months after his death, Melissa is now hoping to create a lasting legacy for her 'fun-loving' son. She has organised a fundraising event in July called ‘The Fenlon Football Funday’ in Stanley Park in the resort, featuring a football tournament and kids entertainment. Melissa said of George: “He just wanted to make people laugh, he was a fun loving guy and very easy going, nothing really fazed him to be honest. \"Clara’s favourite TV show is Teletubbies and he was like a big Teletubby I suppose, just daft and it’s sad that Clara will never experience that. So the fun day is for Clara and all of George’s friends, to keep his memory alive. \"George was just so popular that it’ll be nice for the youngsters of Blackpool not to be sad, but instead remember George through Clara. If it’s a success this year, I’m hoping it will be an annual event. It’s just what George was, he was a fun loving guy who loved his football, so it’s what George would have wanted - for everyone to have a nice day.” Revolution Bar, where George worked, are continuing the celebrations in the evening and will be creating a cocktail in his name. All proceeds will go towards Elliot’s place, a local charity dedicated to supporting young men with their mental health and well being. Melissa added: “George’s friends have been struggling with his loss so the charity just spoke to me, it made sense.”",

        "content": "Mit ihm muss man mitleiden! Fortunas Takashi Uchino (23) ist mit seinem entscheidenden Elfer-Fehlschuss im Relegations-Rückspiel gegen Bochum (5:6 n. E.) unfreiwillig zum tragischen Helden geworden – und war nach dem verpassten Bundesliga -Aufstieg untröstlich. Denn nach dem Elfer-Drama saß der Japaner auf der Treppe in den Katakomben der Düsseldorfer Merkur-Spiel-Arena, wo er minutenlang bitterlich weinte! Lesen Sie auch Wen der Fortuna-Manager meinte : „Die haben alle keine Ahnung!“ Emotionale Szenen nach dem Relegations-Krimi. Fortuna-Manager Allofs spricht Klartext. Bobic-Kündigung nicht rechtmäßig : Millionen-Pleite für Hertha vor Gericht Jetzt ist es amtlich! Die außerordentliche Kündigung von Bobic war unrechtmäßig. Tränen-Drama um Düsseldorfs Uchino! Düsseldorf -Trainer Daniel Thioune (49): „Es herrscht eine totale Leere. Die Mannschaft hat so ein unfassbares Jahr gespielt. Ich habe so viele Tränen gesehen, das hat sie nicht verdient.“ Am meisten Tränen dürfte Uchino vergossen haben! Denn dem Pechvogel versagten als insgesamt 14. Schütze vom Punkt die Nerven. Die Folge: Er jagte die Kugel über die Latte des Bochum-Kastens. Der folgenschwere Fehlschuss: Uchino (l.) jagt die Kugel über den Bochum-Kasten, Fortuna-Kapitän Kastenmeier (vorne) schaut zu Foto: picture alliance / RHR-FOTO Ex-Nationalspieler und Fortuna-Boss Klaus Allofs (67): „Wir waren wirklich kurz davor, in die Bundesliga aufzusteigen. Aber da haben die Nerven nicht mitgespielt.“ Thioune: „Dieses Drama nach 120 Minuten und dann den kleinen Takashi da sitzen zu sehen, das fasst mich richtig an.“ Auf den TV-Bildern war zu erkennen, dass Thioune Uchino auf dem Rasen noch sehr lange umarmt hatte. Ausgerechnet Uchino! Denn der Rechtsverteidiger (350 000 Euro Marktwert, Quelle: transfermarkt.de ) spielt eigentlich kaum eine Rolle bei Fortuna. In der abgelaufenen Zweitliga-Saison durfte er nur viermal von Beginn an ran. Auch am Montag kam er erst in der 83. Minute in die Partie. Was für ein Wahnsinn!

Er und Ao Tanaka (25/Japan) gelten als Mentoren für Uchino. Bei Fortuna wird „Taka“ von allen geliebt, ist total bescheiden, schüchtern und hat immer ein Lächeln auf den Lippen. Nun erlebt er seinen absoluten Horror-Moment. Dabei hat er sich vor ein paar Wochen noch einen großen Traum erfüllt! Denn Ende April/Anfang Mai packte er mit der japanischen U23 die Quali für die Olympischen Spiele! Uchino kam mit 17 Jahren nach der Schule alleine nach Deutschland, spielte in der A-Jugend des 1. FC Düren, dann bei Alemannia Aachen. Anders als viele andere Japaner hatte Uchino bei den unterklassigen Klubs keinen Dolmetscher, musste deswegen schnell Deutsch lernen, was er auch schnell geschafft hat. In den sozialen Medien – vor allem bei Instagram – bekommt er aktuell einen Mega-Zuspruch, wird von zahlreichen Fans aufgebaut statt angefeindet. Hoffentlich hilft ihm das dabei, den Horror-Moment schnellstmöglich zu vergessen ...",

        "content": "Huawei has launched a new smartphone in China. The Enjoy 70s targets the budget market and offers a large battery for heavy use. In this article, we will delve deep into the specifications, features, and pricing of the newly launched phone. Before we dive into other details, let’s look at the Huawei Enjoy 70s design. Design The Huawei P60 series was last year’s flagship lineup from the company. Now, the P-series has been replaced by the Pura lineup. However, the P-series devices always brought a unique design language. Similar is the case with the Huawei P60, which features a unique camera module. With the launch of Huawei Enjoy 70s, the company has brought a similar design to its budget offering. It features the same unique camera module. The Huawei Enjoy 70s measures 168.3 mm in length, 77.7 mm in width, and has a thickness of 8.93 mm, with a weight of approximately 207 grams. The phone comes in a variety of color options including Gold Black, Snow White, and Ice Blue. Hence, the flagship design at this price segment is surely a big highlight of the Huawei Enjoy 70s. Huawei Enjoy 70s Specifications & Features Huawei Enjoy 70s features a 6.75-inch IPS LCD Panel. It features an HD+ resolution, but the 90Hz refresh rate is a plus, offering a smoother experience. The display has a teardrop notch which is acceptable in this price segment. Gizchina News of the week In the camera department, the phone features a 50MP primary sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. While on the front, an 8MP shooter is present for selfies and video calls. The camera offers various modes including night mode, macro shots, and sports capture mode. Talking about the performance, the phone gets a Kirin 710A chip. This chip has 8 cores and is based on a 14nm architecture. In other words, the Enjoy 70s does not primarily focus on performance. While it can handle everyday tasks, it isn’t designed for intensive use. Now let’s move to another big highlight of the phone. The Enjoy 70s has a 6,000mAh battery. This is a huge battery as currently the phones usually offer 5,000mAH capacity. This big battery makes the Enjoy 70s stand out. Moreover, it also has 22.5W fast charging support. In the software department, the phone rocks Harmony OS 4. Another highlight of the device is its dedicated Enjoy X physical button. With this button, users can access their favorite apps with ease. It is fully customizable, and will surely benefit users. Pricing & Availability The Huawei Enjoy 70s is currently available in China. Global availability is not confirmed yet. For China, the phone comes in two variants: 8/128GB and 8/256GB. They are priced at 1,199 Yuan (~$165) and 1,399 Yuan (~$193), respectively. More information can be explored on",

        "description": "George never woke up, but he got to lie with his baby girl before his life support was turned off",
        "content": "This heartbreaking last photo shows a new dad meeting his baby daughter for the first time in hospital just before his life support machine was turned off. George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being injured on a night out in Blackpool, Lancs. His partner Beth Turner, 23, was heavily pregnant at the time and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died. While he never regained consciousness, he was able to meet his daughter in hospital and George's heartbroken mum Melissa captured the touching moment. Melissa, 53, said: \"Looking back now, I’m not sure how we all got through it, the range of emotions we had to go through was horrendous. Beth wanted Clara to meet George and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and she had a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she saw him everyday. “It was important that she did that because we’ve got memories, we’ve got pictures. The hospital did a lot, we’ve also got little prints of Clara’s and George’s hands together.” Police were called at around 2am on August 15 last year to a report of an assault at The Strand in Blackpool. They found George, a bartender at Revolution Bar, had suffered serious head injuries. He was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital and put on a life support machine but tragically died in hospital on November 22. An inquest opening heard George collapsed and lost consciousness. A post-mortem found his cause of death was complications of blunt head trauma. Melissa said of the ordeal: “We were all in shock, we weren’t sure what was happening. \"It was one of his friends who phoned, he said something had happened but no one was sure what. Then we heard George had gone to Royal Preston Hospital and we didn’t know why but when we got more information, we found out he had a serious head injury so Preston was the best place for him. “His girlfriend was six or seven months pregnant at that time so we were all just in shock and when we saw him it was pretty horrific.” Six months after his death, Melissa is now hoping to create a lasting legacy for her 'fun-loving' son. She has organised a fundraising event in July called ‘The Fenlon Football Funday’ in Stanley Park in the resort, featuring a football tournament and kids entertainment. Melissa said of George: “He just wanted to make people laugh, he was a fun loving guy and very easy going, nothing really fazed him to be honest. \"Clara’s favourite TV show is Teletubbies and he was like a big Teletubby I suppose, just daft and it’s sad that Clara will never experience that. So the fun day is for Clara and all of George’s friends, to keep his memory alive. \"George was just so popular that it’ll be nice for the youngsters of Blackpool not to be sad, but instead remember George through Clara. If it’s a success this year, I’m hoping it will be an annual event. It’s just what George was, he was a fun loving guy who loved his football, so it’s what George would have wanted - for everyone to have a nice day.” Revolution Bar, where George worked, are continuing the celebrations in the evening and will be creating a cocktail in his name. All proceeds will go towards Elliot’s place, a local charity dedicated to supporting young men with their mental health and well being. Melissa added: “George’s friends have been struggling with his loss so the charity just spoke to me, it made sense.”",

        "content": "Mike Tyson (57) plant in weniger als zwei Monaten ein Comeback im Ring. Während eines Fluges musste er wegen eines wiederaufgeflammten Magengeschwürs medizinisch versorgt werden. Tyson tritt am 20. Juli gegen Jake Paul im AT&T Stadium an, der Event wird auch auf Netflix live gestreamt. Der ehemalige Schwergewichtsweltmeister Mike Tyson (57) will in weniger als zwei Monaten wieder in den Ring steigen. Während eines Fluges von Miami nach Los Angeles ist es jetzt aber zu einem Zwischenfall rund um den Boxer gekommen, wie mehrere US-Medien übereinstimmend berichten. Tyson habe medizinisch versorgt werden müssen. Ein Sprecher deutet an, dass für den Sportler das Schlimmste jedoch wohl überstand ist. «Glücklicherweise geht es Mr. Tyson gut», habe der Vertreter des Profiboxers dem US-Magazin «People» bestätigt . Etwa 30 Minuten vor der Landung des Flugzeugs sei Tyson demnach aufgrund eines wiederaufgeflammten Magengeschwürs schwindlig und übel geworden. Dem medizinischen Personal, das ihm an Bord der Maschine geholfen habe, sei Tyson dankbar. Mike Tyson tritt gegen Youtuber-Boxer Jake Paul an Der Zwischenfall hat sich nur wenige Wochen vor einem viel diskutierten Kampf ereignet, der am 20. Juli im AT&T Stadium im texanischen Arlington steigen soll. Tyson tritt dann gegen den Youtuber und Boxer Jake Paul (27) an. Beide sorgten in der Vergangenheit abseits des Rings für Kontroversen und Skandale. Nicht nur im Heimstadion der Dallas Cowboys, das 80'000 Plätze bietet, wird das Aufeinandertreffen dann zu sehen sein, es wird auch via Netflix live gestreamt. «Er hat sich im Laufe der Jahre als Boxer erheblich weiterentwickelt», zitiert das Branchenmagazin «Variety» Tyson . Es werde Spass machen zu sehen, was die Ambitionen und der Wille eines «Kindes» gegen seine Fähigkeiten und seine Erfahrung ausrichten könnten. Sich selbst bezeichnete er demnach als «GOAT», also als «Greatest Of All Time» (dt. «Bester aller Zeiten»). Wirst du dir den Kampf zwischen Tyson und Paul anschauen?

        "content": "NEW DELHI, May 28: LIC chairman Siddhartha Mohanty has said that the insurer would enter into the health insurance segment and can explore inorganic options if such an opportunity arises. There are expectations that composite licences may be permitted by amending the Insurance Act. As per the Insurance Act, 1938, and the regulations of the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI), composite licensing for an insurer to undertake life, general, or health insurance under one entity is not allowed. LIC is not an expert in general insurance like fire and engineering but it can do health insurance, he said while sharing financial numbers for FY24. ”Internal work is going on...we will explore inorganic growth in health insurance,” he said. In February, a parliamentary panel suggested the introduction of a composite licence for an insurer to undertake life, general, or health insurance under one entity to increase the penetration of insurance in the country. The panel headed by BJP leader Jayant Sinha had suggested the government to introduce a provision of composite licensing for insurance companies and make the related amendment in legislation at the earliest. Observing that allowing composite licensing could provide further impetus to the insurance sector, owing to its various benefits, the report had said it can cut costs and compliance hassles for insurers, as they can run different insurance lines under one roof. It can also offer customers more choice and value, such as a single policy that covers life, health, and savings, the report tabled in Parliament had said. It can boost insurance reach and awareness in India, as customers can get one insurance from one provider, with lower premiums and easier claims. The committee are aware that to enable composite licensing in India, the government and the IRDAI are planning to bring amendments to the existing insurance legislation, it had said. Meanwhile, insurance behemoth LIC on Monday posted a marginal 2 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 13,763 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 2024 as the corporation made provisions for wage hikes. The insurer had earned a profit of Rs 13,428 crore in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. The total income of the insurer during the reporting quarter rose to Rs 2,50,923 crore from Rs 2,00,185 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal. LIC’s income from first-year premium also improved to Rs 13,810 crore in the latest January-March quarter against Rs 12,811 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal. The income from renewal premiums in the reporting period rose to Rs 77,368 crore compared to Rs 76,009 crore a year ago. During the entire financial year ended March 2024, the insurer earned a profit of Rs 40,676 crore as compared to Rs 36,397 crore in the previous fiscal. The total premium income for the year ended March 2024 was Rs 4,75,070 crore as compared to Rs 4,74,005 crore in the year ended March 2023. A total of 2,03,92,973 policies were sold in the individual segment in FY24 as compared to 2,04,28,937 policies sold previous fiscal. The board recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share for 2023-24 subject to approval of shareholders, Mohanty said. Earlier, during the year an interim dividend of Rs 4 was declared and paid to shareholders of the corporation. Therefore, he said, the total interim and recommended final dividend aggregates to Rs 10 per share. (PTI)",

        "content": "Im \"Polizeiruf 110: Funkensommer\" spielt Gerhard Wittmann den Wachmann Andreas Busch, der den Brand in einem Gebäude entdeckt. Der Schauspieler ist im Krimi-Genre längst kein Unbekannter mehr. Der unglückselige Wachmann Andreas Busch führt gleich in den ersten Minuten des neuen \" : Funkensommer\"(26. Mai um 20:15 Uhr im Ersten) äußerst drastisch auf das Thema hin: Er beobachtet panisch, wie ein Haus abbrennt. In seinen Brillengläsern spiegeln sich nicht nur die lodernden Flammen des brennenden Gebäudes, sondern vor allem die Hilflosigkeit und Angst in seinen Augen. Auch im weiteren Verlauf des Krimis stellt der Busch-Darsteller Gerhard Wittmann (60) sein schauspielerisches Talent eindrucksvoll unter Beweis. Wittmann gelingt es, den labilen Wachmann perfekt abzubilden. Er sorgt mit seiner verschwiegenen und verschämten Art von der ersten Minute an für Spannung und trägt so durch den Krimi. Seine Darstellung der Einsamkeit erregt Mitleid beim Zuschauer, ohne danach zu heischen - sein tragisches Ende, das die Charaktere im Film und die Rezipienten gleichermaßen berührt, stellt den Wendepunkt der Ermittlungen dar. Hartgesottene Krimi- und Bayernfans dürften den Herrn Busch sicher gleich erkennen: Seit 2013 verkörpert er in den \"Eberhofer\"-Krimis nach den Buchvorlagen von Rita Falk (59) Leopold Eberhofer. Der schnöselige Buchhändler ist bei seinem Bruder, dem Niederkaltenkirchener Dorfpolizisten Franz Eberhofer (Sebastian Bezzel, 52), zwar verhasst - das Publikum konnte Gerhard Wittmann mit dieser Rolle umso mehr für sich gewinnen. Der 1964 im bayrischen Aindling geborene Wittmann begann seine Schauspielkarriere auf der Theaterbühne. Seit dem Ende der 1990er-Jahre ist er regelmäßig im Fernsehen zu sehen, unter anderem bei den \"Rosenheim-Cops\" und \"SOKO München\". Er hat jede Menge bayrische Sonntagskrimis in seiner Filmografie: Bereits 2000 stand er im Münchner \"Tatort: Kleine Diebe\" gemeinsam mit den Ermittlern Ivo Batic (Miroslav Nemec, 69) und Franz Leitmayr (Udo Wachtveitl, 65) vor der Kamera. Zuletzt spielte Wittmann im April im \"Tatort: Schau mich an\" an ihrer Seite. Auch hier begeisterte er in seiner Rolle als neugieriger Hausmeister mit Blockwart-Mentalität. Gerhard Wittmann trifft im jüngsten \"Polizeiruf 110\" gleich auf mehrere \"Eberhofer\"-Kollegen. Stephan Zinner (49), der den Kommissar Dennis Eden verkörpert, gehört ebenfalls zur Stammbesetzung in der bayrischen Einöde. Er ist seit der ersten Verfilmung als Niederkaltenkirchener Dorfmetzger Simmerl zu sehen, Franz Eberhofers engstem Freund. Frederic Linkemann (43), in \"Funkensommer\" der cholerische Junior-Chef der Firma Hechtle, spielte in mehreren Filmen den loyalen Polizisten Franz Stopfer. (eyn/spot)",

Quelle: Daniel Karmann/dpa/Symbolbild Menschen sollen auf einem Schützenfest rassistische Parolen gesungen haben. Nun hat sich der Vorstand des Schützenvereins dazu beraten. Die mutmaßlichen Täter verlassen den Verein. Löningen (dpa/lni). Nach dem Bekanntwerden von rassistischen Gesängen auf einem Schützenfest in Löningen bei Cloppenburg haben mehrere mutmaßliche Täter den Schützenverein verlassen. Sie würden somit weiteren Schaden von dem Verein abwenden wollen, wie der Vorstand des Schützenvereins Bunnen nach einer Vorstandssitzung in der Nacht auf Dienstag mitteilte. Die Beteiligten hätten sich zudem selbst mit der Polizei in Verbindung gesetzt. «Der Vorstand unterstützt diese Entscheidung und nimmt den Austritt an», hieß es. Darüber hinaus habe der Verein keine weiteren Mitglieder ausgeschlossen. Weitere Mitglieder, die auf Videos von den rassistischen Gesängen zu sehen waren, hätten dem Vorstand versichert, dass sie aufgrund der Lautstärke nichts von den Parolen mitbekommen haben. Sie hätten den regulären Liedtext gesungen. Sollten durch Ermittlungen des Staatsschutzes weitere mutmaßliche Täter bekanntwerden, würde erneut über Vereinsausschlüsse beraten werden. Der Vorfall auf dem mehrtägigen Schützenfest war am Freitag bekanntgeworden. Am Pfingstmontag sollen rassistische Parolen wie «Ausländer raus» und «Deutschland den Deutschen» zu dem Lied «L'amour toujours» von Gigi D'Agostino gesungen worden sein. Der Schützenverein Bunnen hatte sich unmittelbar nach dem Bekanntwerden von dem Vorfall distanziert. Der Vorstand betonte nun noch einmal, dass die meisten Festbesucher die Parolen nicht gesungen hätten. Verein will Verantwortung übernehmen Der Verein wolle aber auch Verantwortung übernehmen. «Wir nehmen die Sache ernst, bitte vertrauen Sie uns», schrieb der Vorstand in der Mitteilung. Mit jungen Mitgliedern des Vereins und Freiwilligen solle im Rahmen von Beratungsangeboten über den Umgang mit Rechtsradikalismus gesprochen werden. Dazu habe der Verein bereits Kontakt mit dem Staatsschutz aufgenommen. Zudem sei bei der Vorstandsitzung ein Verhaltenskodex erarbeitet worden, «den sämtliche Mitglieder unseres Vereins akzeptieren und leben sollen». Mehr zum Thema Kostenpflichtig ﻿ Nazi-Parolen zu Partyhit auch auf Schützenfest in Niedersachsen Weiter kritisierte der Verein allerdings auch die Berichterstattung in den Medien und sozialen Medien. So würden falsche Angaben gemacht, nach denen vermeintlich das gesamte Festzelt die Parolen gesungen habe. Oder es würden unverpixelte Aufnahmen von der Veranstaltung verbreitet. «Bei uns zerbrechen aktuell Familien, Freundschaften, Nachbarschaften und Seelen junger Menschen», teilte der Vorstand mit. Er betonte zudem, dass die Verdächtigen, gegen die der Staatsschutz ermittele, zum Teil noch minderjährig seien. «Wir appellieren an die Medien, auch die sozialen Medien, den Druck aus der Berichterstattung zu nehmen», so der Vorstand.

Israel ha reaccionado con ira al reconocimiento oficial del Estado palestino hecho por España, Irlanda y Noruega e incluso ha prohibido al Consulado español en Jerusalén prestar servicios consulares a los palestinos residentes en la Cisjordania ocupada como represalia.

Uno de los destinos con mejores indicadores de calidad de vida, con una excelente planta hotelera y una gastronomía rica y saludable. Un lugar donde desconectar en un ambiente de tranquilidad, bienestar y exclusividad . Testigo de todo ello ha sido Erin McCafferty, periodista del periódico londinense 'The Times' , quien describe Navarra como \"una joya fuera de lo común\". En una publicación de más de 1100 palabras, Erin McCafferty hace que sus lectores recorran las calles de Navarra y descubran la riqueza cultura que la caracteriza. Una información que dedicando un espacio privilegiado a, como no podía ser de otra forma, San Fermín . Además de hablar del origen de la festividad y de la trascendencia que tiene la misma, el periodista resalta que se trata, nada más y nada menos que, del \"evento más prestigioso\". Además de San Fermín, McCafferty destaca a Ernest Hemingway como el otro gran reclamo de Pamplona. Tal y como el propio periodista describe, la novela 'The Sun Also Rises' de Ernest Hemingway, publicada en 1926, se desarrolla en medio de la fiesta de San Fermín y se basa en personas que conoció el autor en Pamplona para crear los personajes. Erin McCafferty dedica una serie de líneas a Ernest Hemingway y a su conexión con el territorio navarro . Centrando su atención en la parte más geográfica, el redactor señala que, por la noche, la Plaza del Castillo , repleta de bares y restaurantes, está repleta de gente joven. \"Durante el día, los lugareños se sientan en los bancos del parque, toman el sol y escuchan a los músicos callejeros tocar la guitarra\", describe McCafferty Los halagos del periodista de 'The Times' hacia el territorio navarro no se quedan ahí. \"Es fácil ver por qué Hemingway se enamoró de Pamplona. Carece de la pretenciosidad de las grandes ciudades españolas como Madrid o Barcelona, ​​pero conserva una elegancia pasada de moda . El norte de España es la región más rica del país, dados sus vínculos industriales, y se nota. Es una ciudad atractiva y habitada, con arquitectura del viejo mundo, iglesias y una gran cantidad de fuentes para beber\", afirma Erin McCafferty. Erin McCafferty recorre, junto con sus lectores, la Selva de Irati , las Bodegas Máximo Abete, el Palacio Real de Olite , las Bardenas Reales , disfruta de una selección de tapas locales y concluye así: \"regresamos a Pamplona, ​​maravillándonos ante la diversidad y la belleza intacta de la región de Navarra \".",

        "content": "Double peine pour les Franciliens. En Île-de-France, 9,7 millions d'habitants (sur un total de 12,3 millions) sont exposés simultanément à des « pollutions sonores et atmosphériques à des niveaux qui excèdent de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) », d'après une première étude croisée d'Airparif et Bruiparif publiée ce mardi. Soit près de 80 % de la population d'Ile de France qui est exposée simultanément à une et à des niveaux importants de bruit. Une grande partie de ces collectivités sont situées dans le coeur dense de l'agglomération parisienne, notamment Paris, les collectivités de petite couronne et particulièrement celles situées à proximité des aéroports, souligne Airparif. A l'inverse, dans 316 collectivités, la quasi-totalité de la population est relativement épargnée et par la pollution de l'air et par les nuisances sonores, avec des concentrations de polluants de l'air et des niveaux de bruits proches des seuils recommandés par l'OMS. Il s'agit pour la plupart de communes situées au sein des départements de la grande couronne et qui ne sont pas concernées par des survols d'aéronefs à moins de 2.000 mètres d'altitude. Dans Paris intra-muros et ses communes limitrophes, on observe une forte corrélation entre la pollution atmosphérique et sonore, notamment près des grandes artères circulatoires comme le boulevard périphérique. Certains espaces verts majeurs ou quartiers centraux souffrent d'une pollution de l'air qui se situe à des niveaux élevés mais une pollution sonore liée aux transports peu présente. À noter également, certains lieux, tels que les boisements de Vincennes et Boulogne ainsi que dans certains quartiers du sud-ouest de Paris, où la situation est « légèrement meilleure ». D'autres zones sont concernées par la pollution sonore, mais peu par la pollution de l'air, notamment celles situées à proximité des voies ferrées dans la moitié sud de la région Île-de-France, ainsi que celles qui sont affectées par les survols à destination et en provenance des aéroports de Paris-Orly et de Paris-CDG et qui sont situées en dehors du coeur dense de l'agglomération parisienne. Cette double exposition représente un vrai danger pour la santé. Les nuisances sonores peuvent troubler le sommeil, augmenter les risques de maladies cardiaques et de diabète, et réduire les capacités d'apprentissage. Ce qui génère un coût social élevé estimé à 43 milliards d'euros en Île-de-France, selon une étude de BruitParif datant de 2021. La pollution atmosphérique contribue également à l'apparition de maladie comme le diabète ou de troubles cardiovasculaires, respiratoires et même du cancer du poumon. Ce qui réduit l'espérance de vie et est à l'origine d'environ 7.900 décès prématurés chaque année dans la région. Samir Touzani",

        "content": "Laut IFO-Institut entwickelt die deutsche Exportwirtschaft zwar \"noch keine große Dynamik\", mittlerweile hat sich die Stimmungslage aber dennoch deutlich gebessert. Mehrere Branchen erwarten einen deutlichen Zuwachs. Schwieriger wird allerdings das Geschäft mit China. Die deutsche Industrie blickt so optimistisch auf ihr Auslandsgeschäft wie sei über einem Jahr nicht mehr. Das Barometer für ihre Exporterwartungen stieg im Mai auf Plus 0,3 Prozent, nachdem es im April noch bei minus 1,5 Zählern gelegen hatte, wie das Münchner IFO-Institut zu seiner Unternehmensumfrage mitteilte. Das ist der höchste Wert seit April 2023. \"Positive und negative Antworten gleichen sich fast aus\", ordnete der Leiter der IFO-Umfragen, Klaus Wohlrabe, das Ergebnis ein. \"Die Exportwirtschaft entwickelt insgesamt noch keine große Dynamik.\" In den einzelnen Branchen ist die Entwicklung sehr unterschiedlich. Einen deutlichen Zuwachs beim Exportgeschäft erwarten etwa die Getränkehersteller. \"Ähnliches gilt auch für die Möbelindustrie sowie für die Produktion von Glas und Keramik\", so das IFO-Institut. Einen merklichen Dämpfer mussten dagegen die Hersteller von Datenverarbeitungsgeräten verkraften. Dort ließen sich die sehr optimistischen Erwartungen aus dem Vormonat nicht aufrechterhalten. \"Im Maschinenbau und im Autosektor zeigt sich im Moment wenig Bewegung\", fanden die IFO-Forscher zudem heraus. Mit einem Rückgang ihrer Exporte rechnen die Textil- und Bekleidungswirtschaft, die Drucker sowie die Metallbranche. Der Außenhandel hat die deutsche Konjunktur im ersten Quartal angeschoben. Die Ausfuhr von Waren legte von Januar bis März um 2,1 Prozent zum Vorquartal zu - nicht zuletzt wegen der starken Nachfrage nach Waren \"Made in Germany\" aus den USA. Das trug dazu bei, dass das Bruttoinlandsprodukt im ersten Quartal um 0,2 Prozent wuchs und damit eine Rezession in Europas größter Volkswirtschaft verhindert wurde. Die Deutsche Industrie- und Handelskammer (DIHK) rechnet für 2024 insgesamt allerdings nur mit einem stagnierenden Geschäft. So ist etwa der chinesische Markt schwieriger geworden. \"China ist auf der Leiter der Wertschöpfungskette aufgestiegen und stellt vermehrt komplexere Güter selbst her, die es früher aus Deutschland importiert hat\", sagte Commerzbank-Ökonom Vincent Stamer. \"Zudem produzieren deutsche Unternehmen zunehmend vor Ort, anstatt die Waren von Deutschland nach China zu exportieren.\"",

        "content": "News | Crime I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . A watch dealer put in a chokehold during a robbery at his west London store has been found dead. Two men stole a number of high-value watches from the shop in Kew Road, Richmond on Saturday afternoon. CCTV shows the member of staff being assaulted after initially being asked to fix a timepiece for them. The victim, who is from Surrey, died hours later and his next of kin have been informed, the Metropolitan Police said. A spokesman added: “We are aware of the death of a man in Surrey on Sunday, May 26. “This is being investigated by officers from Surrey Police and is not being treated as suspicious at this time. “The man who died was the victim of a robbery at a jewellers in Richmond on Saturday, May 25. “We ask that the privacy of his family is respected at this difficult time.” The pair of robbers fled with a large loot of watches during the raid at 2.50pm. Footage shows one suspect put the employee, who was not seriously injured, in a headlock while the other ransacks the shop. The dealer is held by both arms and violently pushed across the room on his chair into a corner. He looks on helplessly as a robber stuffs watches into a bag. One of the men wore a grey hoodie and ripped blue jeans. The second, with a distinctive neck tattoo, had blue jeans, a blue and white T-shirt and sunglasses on his head. Richmond is one of the most affluent residential areas in the country - with five-bed properties on Kew Road selling for more than £4.5 million. The area is home to celebrities including broadcaster Sir David Attenborough and singer Rick Astley. Anyone who recognises the men or has information that could assist police is asked to call 101, quoting CAD4555/25May, Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

        "content": "Oriente Próximo Israel Katz, ministro de Exteriores de Israel. / EP EP El ministro de Exteriores israelí, Israel Katz , ha acusado este martes al presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez , de ser \"cómplice de incitar al genocidio judío \" por reconocer al Estado palestino y por no cesar a la vicepresidenta Yolanda Díaz cuando dijo que \"Palestina será libre desde el río hasta el mar\". En un mensaje en la red social X, tanto en español como en hebreo , Katz acusó a Díaz de buscar la eliminación de Israel y el establecimiento de un \"Estado terrorista\" palestino y la commparó con el líder supremo iraní, Ali Jameneí, y con el líder de Hamás en Gaza, Yahya Sinwar . Sánchez defiende el reconocimiento del Estado palestino: \"Busca contribuir a la paz. No es una decisión contra Israel\" La vicepresidenta Díaz matizó posteriormente sus palabras y dijo que cuando aseguró que \"Palestina será libre desde el río hasta el mar\" se refería a que los dos Estados, Israel y Palestina , deben \"compartir un futuro de paz y prosperidad\", después de que la embajadora israelí en Madrid, Radica Radian-Gordon, le acusara de emplear \"un lema de Hamás\" . \"Presidente @sanchezcastejon - al no despedir a @yolanda_diaz_ y anunciar el reconocimiento del Estado palestino - es c ómplice de incitación al asesinato del pueblo judío y de crímenes de guerra \" escribió hoy el ministro israelí de Exteriores, etiquetando además la cuenta del líder del Partido Popular, Alberto Núñez Feijóo. Israel ha reaccionado con ira al reconocimiento oficial del Estado palestino hecho por España, Irlanda y Noruega e incluso ha prohibido al Consulado español en Jerusalén prestar servicios consulares a los palestinos residentes en la Cisjordania ocupada como represalia. Está previsto que más tarde el Consejo de Ministros español apruebe el reconocimiento de Palestina como Estado, sin aceptar cambios en las líneas fronterizas de 1967 que no sean acordados por las partes.

        "content": "Roads were reopened and the Mthatha Airport is set to resume its service on Tuesday after a taxi protest disrupted traffic and flights , car rental and other supporting services suspended on Monday. The Mthatha region descended into chaos on Monday with main roads blockaded and trucks looted. Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane said on Monday afternoon the confiscation of guns from taxi operators had prompted \"anarchy\" in the region. He briefed the media along with the MEC for transport and community safety, Xolile Nqatha, and the MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs, Zolile Williams. DispatchLIVE reported that police had confiscated almost 50 firearms, mostly from guards and taxi owners at Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital in Mthatha last week. The guards were protecting Border Alliance Taxi Association (Bata) taxi bosses wounded when their convoy was ambushed between Nqanqarhu and Tsolo on Wednesday. Most of the weapons were returned to the association on Monday afternoon, halting the protest action, the newspaper reported. \" Those guns had to be taken through the ballistic tests and police had to do their work because hospitals are gun-free zones. There was no way that there would be special treatment to anyone when there is a law in this country that governs,\" said Mabuyane. \"We are looking at this issue with interest in terms of the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority [PSiRA] — exactly what PSiRA says on those issues of the high-calibre guns, rifles that are in public places. \"As the provincial government we condemn these acts of anarchy characterised by blockages of the national roads leaving commuters stranded and unable to go to work, with learners also unable to go to school, disruptions of healthcare services and other places of interest.\" He said the protests had also hindered the first day of the special votes in the OR Tambo district municipality. \" Law enforcement agencies have been deployed across the province to monitor the situation and ensure safety and security of our citizens.\" On Tuesday the spokesperson for the department of transport and community safety in the province, Unathi Bingose, said normality had returned with a resumptions of services. He said the suspension of service at the airport was hastened after five gunmen wearing balaclavas had stormed the airport, threatening to burn it if it did not close. He said the five men were later stopped in their tracks by the police, who shot and wounded two of the men after they allegedly opened fire on the police. \"The police retaliated and a shootout ensued. By the end of it, two men were injured and all five suspects were rounded up and arrested. Two of them are under police guard in hospital,\" he said. Nqatha said the invasion and forced closure of the airport was an irresponsible act and a direct provocation of the state. He commended the police for protecting the strategic point and welcomed the resumption of services at the airport on Tuesday. Bingose said Mthatha welcomed the arrival of SA National Defence Force members who are bringing more boots on the ground to restore and maintain law and order. National police commissioner Gen Fannie Masemola on Monday also announced the deployment of extra police officers to the province, to ensure that voting takes place in a safe and secure environment.

        "content": "On Tuesday, JPMorgan commenced coverage on Viking Holdings (NYSE:VIK) shares, assigning an Overweight rating on the stock and establishing a price target of $34.00. The firm's analysis suggests that Viking is well-positioned to capture a significant portion of the $1.9 trillion global vacation market. Key factors contributing to this optimistic outlook include the company's focus on an affluent and rapidly growing demographic of individuals over 55 years old who hold 70% of US wealth, a strategy that avoids yield cannibalization through destination-focused offerings, and a scalable business model that has already achieved a 51% market share in river cruises and 26% in ocean luxury cruises. Viking's commitment to educational and destination-centric experiences is expected to foster sustainable customer loyalty, evidenced by past guests accounting for over 60% of bookings for inaugural seasons of new products. The company also boasts a high guest repeat rate, which has increased from 26% in 2015 to approximately 51% today, underscoring the effectiveness of its \"One Brand\" marketing strategy. JPMorgan's projections for Viking Holdings include an approximate 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue through 2026, which is double the average for the cruise industry. This optimistic forecast is supported by an 11% anticipated growth in capacity—nearly triple the industry's average of about 4%—and a conservative estimate of 3.6% net yield growth, compared to the pre-pandemic CAGR of over 5%. The analysis concludes with an expectation of a 38% EBITDA margin for Viking Holdings and an approximate 20% growth in EBITDA dollar terms, reinforcing the company's strong financial outlook. InvestingPro Insights As Viking Holdings (NYSE:VIK) sails towards an ambitious growth trajectory, InvestingPro data highlights several key financial metrics that investors may find valuable. With a market capitalization of $12.81 billion, the company's revenue growth impresses, having surged by 48.32% over the last twelve months as of Q4 2023. This is further complemented by a robust gross profit margin of 40.82%, reflecting efficient operations and a strong pricing strategy. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Viking Holdings is a prominent player in the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry, with a strong return over the last month, indicating investor confidence. Analysts predict the company will be profitable this year, which could be a harbinger of future financial stability.

Puhelinnumeron avulla toimivat nopeat rahansiirrot Tanskan, Norjan ja Suomen välillä tulevat mahdollisiksi ennen juhannusta, kertoo maksupalveluyritys Vipps Mobilepay . Palvelu lanseerataan 19. kesäkuuta, vahvistaa Vipps Mobilepayn toimitusjohtaja Rune Garborg SVT:lle . Suomen ja Tanskan Mobilepayn sekä Norjan Vippsin yhdistyminen käynnistyi vuonna 2022, ja yhtiöt siirtyivät yhteiseen maksualustaan vuoden 2024 ensimmäisellä neljänneksellä. Uuden alustan ansiosta käyttäjät voivat lähettää ja vastaanottaa rahaa pelkän puhelinnumeron avulla maiden rajojen yli. Ruotsissa palvelu tulee saatavilla ensi syksynä. Siellä mobiilimaksusovellus Swish on kuitenkin niin suosittu, että Garborg sanoi SVT:n haastattelussa, ettei yhtiö aio ryhtyä Swishin kilpailijaksi Ruotsissa, vaan pyrkii sen kanssa yhteistyöhön. Nopeat mobiilimaksut Pohjoismaiden välillä eivät kuitenkaan ole ilmaisia. Asiakkaat joutuvat maksamaan pankin veloittaman kulun sekä Vipps Mobilepayn perimän maksun, mutta tarkat hinnat eivät ole vielä selvillä. Vipps Mobilepaylla on yhtiön mukaan jo 12 miljoonaa käyttäjää ja sen palveluiden välityksellä Suomessa, Norjassa ja Tanskassa oli tapahtunut yli 1,2 miljardia transaktiota vuoden 2023 loppuun mennessä. Aiemmin tänä vuonna Vipps Mobilepay kertoi liikevaihtonsa vuonna 2023 kasvaneen fuusion myötä noin 137 miljoonaan euroon, mutta samalla toiminta tuotti vielä tappiota noin 96 miljoonaa euroa. Yhtiö aikoo puolittaa tappionsa tänä vuonna muun muassa sulkemalla Vilnan toimistonsa, vähentämällä konsulttien käyttöä Norjassa ja pienentämällä transaktiokustannuksia Suomessa.

Но може би по ключово е, че подадените поръчки са били за едва 357 млн. лв., което дава коефициент на покритие от едва 1.19, докато при предишните два аукциона търсенето надвишаваше предлагането над два пъти. \"За съжаление ентусиазмът от първите два аукциона бързо угасна и даде път на прагматизма и предпазливостта. Вял интерес от пазарните участници и респективно много по-ниско покритие. Политическата несигурност и неяснотата дали и след изборите ще продължи ударното емитиране на вътрешния пазар по-скоро прави големите институционални инвеститори внимателни наблюдатели на този пазар с оглед и на нелошите алтернативи като ДЦК на страни в региона със сходен рисков профил като България\", коментира Мартин Търпанов, ръководител на отдел \"Дългови инструменти\" в \"Делтасток\". Почти само банки Друг важен момент е, че в голямата си част влошаването на постигнатата доходност идва отвън и всъщност спредовете спрямо аналогичните германски облигации се свива. При първото пласиране на емисията през април той беше 45 базисни пункта, докато сега е 39 базсини пункта, но самите германски тригодишни ДЦК се търгуват на по-високи нива. Няма и 10% от нужното \"Числата в бюджета предполагат страната в един момент да излезе и на международните пазари с по-голяма емисия, което също допринася за предпазливостта на местните инвеститори и изискването на малко по-висока доходност. Задържането на бенчмарковите лихви на сравнително високи нива също не помага на емитента за постигане на по-добра цена на финансиране\", обясни Търпанов. Априорно беше ясно, че такива количества са непосилни за вътрешния пазар и България ще излиза и с емисия еврооблигации. Задъхването на търсенето от местните инвеститори и изравняването на доходностите с тези по международните емсии може да наклони планирания миск във финансирането от МФ повече към външния пазар. Там страната има предимството да е приемана като рядък, слабо задлъжнял емитент с перспектива да влезе в еврозоната, което представлява добра добавка към портфейлите от дълг на развиващите се пазари. Засега все още няма публикуван емисионен календар за юни, от който да се види дали правителството планира да продължи с аукционите на вътрешния пазар. Етикети",

La mayoría de las víctimas mortales pertenecían a una misma familia y fallecieron al ser alcanzadas por un proyectil que cayó sobre su tienda de campaña en el campo de desplazados, situado en el oeste de Rafa, según informaciones de la agencia palestina de noticias WAFA, que apuntan a que el campamento se encuentra situado en las inmediaciones de una sede de la Agencia de Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados de Palestina en Oriente Próximo (UNRWA). Posteriormente, al menos un palestino ha muerto en otro ataque perpetrado contra el Hospital Indonesio , en la misma ciudad. Mientras, en el centro de la Franja de Gaza se han registrado bombardeos, que también se han saldado con varias víctimas mortales. El ataque perpetrado el lunes contra el campamento de Barakasat ha despertado una oleada de críticas y condenas a nivel internacional y ha llevado al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU a convocar para este mismo martes una reunión de emergencia a petición de Argelia para abordar la situación. El Ejército de Israel confirmó entonces el bombardeo y señaló que logró neutralizar a dos altos cargos de Hamás , si bien reconoció que «como consecuencia del ataque y un incendio desatado a posteriori en la zona varias personas resultaron heridas». Así, ha afirmado que se está «revisando» el incidente. Israel comenzó una ofensiva contra la Franja de Gaza a raíz de los ataques de Hamás, que se saldaron con 1.200 muertos y 240 rehenes. Desde entonces, las autoridades gazatíes han notificado la muerte de más de 36.000 palestinos , a los que se suman más de 510 en Cisjordania y en Jerusalén Este como consecuencia de las acciones de las fuerzas de seguridad y los ataques de colonos israelíes.

        "content": "Stati Uniti e Unione Europea stanno cercando di rafforzare le produzione domestica di chip con nuove legislazioni e grandi investimenti, con anche una serie di restrizioni alla vendita di chip e strumenti di fascia alta in Cina , come ben sappiamo. Non sorprenderà quindi che è arrivata a stretto giro una risposta della nazione asiatica. Secondo quanto riportato da Reuters, il China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, sostenuto dallo Stato, ha dichiarato di aver raccolto fondi per 344 miliardi di yuan (poco meno di 44 milioni di euro), che saranno utilizzati per promuovere lo sviluppo e raggiungere l'autosufficienza dell'industria cinese dei chip. Il Ministero delle Finanze cinese è il maggior contribuente del fondo con una quota del 17%, mentre la China Development Bank Capital è il secondo azionista con una quota del 10,5%. Il resto del fondo è composto da altri diciassette contribuenti, tra cui cinque grandi banche cinesi. Questa è in realtà la terza fase di finanziamento di quello che è conosciuto localmente come il \"Grande Fondo\". Il primo round del 2014 ha raccolto circa €20 miliardi, mentre il secondo round ha raccolto circa €28 miliardi nel 2019. La terza fase deve però essere applicata in modo più rapido in seguito all'intensificarsi di una serie di sanzioni e divieti sulla vendita di chip e attrezzature alla Cina. Reuters riporta che la terza fase degli investimenti del \" Grande Fondo \" si concentrerà sullo sviluppo di attrezzature utilizzate per la produzione di chip. Come sapevamo inoltre, la Cina si prepara ad abbandonare i chip Intel e AMD .",

        "content": "La vicepresidenta segunda y líder de Sumar , Yolanda Díaz, ha acusado al ala socialista del Gobierno de actuar «con falta de lealtad» hacia su socio de coalición con su «opacidad» por el envío de armas a Ucrania y ha exigido que deje de «actuar en solitario» y no impida el debate sobre esta medida en el Congreso. En declaraciones a TVE, recogidas por Europa Press, ha subrayado que la falta de transparencia con la que ha operado el PSOE en este asunto es «muy grave», dado que en dos ocasiones Sumar presentó en el seno del Gobierno observaciones sobre el destino de los 1.130 millones de gasto militar aprobado en abril y «no se le contestó», hasta que ayer conoció por la prensa de que el destino era armas para Ucrania. « Es muy grave por una falta de lealtad con el socio de gobierno, pero es más grave por la falta de lealtad con los españoles . La política de defensa es muy importante en el país y la ciudadanía tiene derecho a que exista un debate público sobre si este proceder es correcto o no», ha enfatizado Díaz. Rebate a Sánchez: Esto se debe debatir en el Congreso Así, ha rechazado el argumento del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, de no llevar el acuerdo bilateral con su homólogo ucraniano, Volodímir Zelenski , al ser un memorándum de entendimiento. Concretamente, Díaz ha sentenciado que ese envío implica cantidades «elevadísimas» en un contexto sin nuevos Presupuestos Generales, por lo que el PSOE debe recapacitar y hacer este debate democrático para que los grupos se pronuncien. Cuestionada sobre si va a hablar con el presidente del Gobierno para expresarle su malestar, la líder de Sumar ha señalado que siempre actuará con discreción sobre sus conversaciones con Sánchez , para insistir en su formación ya manifestó su postura crítica sobre la aprobación de ese gasto militar en abril, que se efectuó con «total opacidad». «La política de defensa española que tiene que estar sometida democráticamente al debate del Congreso para que lo conozca la ciudadanía, pero que para también, lógicamente, en una democracia, los partidos políticos tienen que opinar», ha zanjado.

        "content": "Dies gelte auch für das Gerücht, er sei ein Kandidat für den CEO-Posten bei Bär: «Ich bin seit über 20 Jahren für die EFG-Gruppe tätig, und ich habe einen ziemlich guten Job hier», so Pradelli an einer Telefonkonferenz. Julius Bär soll laut Nachrichtenagenturen ein Auge auf EFG geworfen haben. Die Bank habe in den letzten Wochen vorläufige Gespräche mit EFG über die Möglichkeit eines Zusammenschlusses geführt, schrieb die Nachrichtenagentur Bloomberg am Freitagabend. Laut Reuters sind diese Gespräche jedoch abgebrochen worden. Julius Bär und auch EFG hatten am Freitag keinen Kommentar abgegeben. Mit den ersten vier Monaten des Geschäftsjahres von EFG ist Pradelli mehr als zufrieden. «Wir hatten einen sehr guten Start ins Jahr», sagte er. In den ersten vier Monaten betrug der Neugeldzufluss den Angaben zufolge netto 3,6 Milliarden Franken. Die verwalteten Vermögen kamen derweil per Ende April bei 157,5 Milliarden Franken zu liegen - nach 142,2 Milliarden Ende 2023. Der Anstieg von 11 Prozent wurde mit den Nettoneugeldern, Wechselkursschwankungen und einem günstigen Marktumfeld begründet. Unter dem Strich habe der Reingewinn den Wert von 110 Millionen Franken übertroffen, teilte das Unternehmen weiter mit. Ein Vorjahreswert wurde in der Mitteilung zwar nicht genannt. Es wurde aber auf den Jahresgewinn 2023 von 303,2 Millionen verwiesen.",

Об этом пишет «Интерфакс» со ссылкой на председателя правления Союза экспортеров зерна Эдуарда Зернина. «Сомнений в рекордном экспорте уже ни у кого не возникает», – сказал он. Зернин отметил, что текущий показатель превысил уровень прошлого сезона на 10 млн т. Кроме того, наблюдается опережение по пшенице более чем на 5 млн т. Столько же в текущем сезоне прибавили ячмень и кукуруза. Зернин также сообщил, что доля новых рынков стран Азии, Африки и Латинской Америки в поставках заметно выросла. По его словам, Россия заново открыла для себя рынок Индонезии, Марокко, Эритреи, а также значительно нарастила поставки в Китай. При этом доля стран Ближнего Востока и Северной Африки в поставках снизилась до 65% – до этого показатель был на уровне 80%. 26 марта в пресс-службе Минсельхоза России сообщили о распределении между экспортерами дополнительных тарифных квот на вывоз пшеницы, меслина, ячменя, ржи и кукурузы объемом около 107 467 т. Таким образом, завершилась первая часть выдачи допквот на 2,4 млн т. С 8 по 14 мая Минсельхоз РФ снизил пошлину на экспорт пшеницы и меслина до 3277,7 руб., а также установил нулевую пошлину на ячмень и кукурузу.",

Kangana is contesting against Congress stronghold of Mandi against Vikramaditya Singh, the son of late former CM Virbhadra Singh.

She wrested the seat for the Congress in the bye-election that was held following the demise of then-BJP MP Ram Swaroop Sharma.

However, you could be entitled to a refund on the cost of your TV Licence if you do not watch or record live TV, and don’t stream BBC iPlayer either. You can apply for a refund if you won’t need your licence again before it expires, and you have at least one complete month left on it, due to not watching or recording live TV.

Any refund will be paid by cheque or a BACS transfer directly into your bank account. The amount you will be due in a refund will be worked out by TV Licensing , the organisation that issues TV licences.

        "content": "A woman has taken her image to a new extreme level by inserting horns on her head. Australia's self-proclaimed \"most tattooed woman\" has hit the headlines a lot in the past due to her unique look. She was previously left without sight for a whopping three weeks after getting her eyeballs inked . Recently, she even had the \"agonising\" procedure done again. Amber Luke, known as \"Dragon Girl\" online, has splashed out an eye-watering £144,000 on tattoos and body modificaitons. But now she's revealed to her Instagram followers that she's mixed up her image even more, as she's had horn implants inserted. The blonde beauty shared a number of close-up snaps of the new facial additions online. When you look at her forehead you can see that two sections are highly raised to make horns above her eyes. You can also see the stitch marks where the skin as been tacked back together. Since she revealed her latest treatment, people have been asking lots of questions, though some didn't seem surprised by the move. It seems as though her fans are just really excited to follow her journey and see what she does next.

Making me wanna book my next mod seeing you get all this fun stuff recently.\" Another wrote: \"Your look just keeps getting better and better! Saw you at chermside a few weeks ago and wanted to say hi but got shy.\" A third wrote: \"Amazing. You continue to be such an inspiration.\" Meanwhile, a fourth commented: \"Mega beautiful implants.\" Even though many were quick to praise her new look, some did have questions. It looks as though some may have never seen the body modification before. One asked: \"I'm confused what exactly you had done???\" Another also chirped in with: \"What holds them in place under the skin?\" It may seem an extreme look to some, but Amber boasts a huge following thanks to the thousands of people who love her creative look. Bold and beautiful – it's fair to say she lives a colourful life while under and away from the needle. She's spent thousands on transforming her look ( Image: @amberluke666/Instagram) Amber's fans seem to love the latest addition to her look ( Image: @amberluke666/Instagram) As well as her tattoo addiction, the 27-year-old model, from Brisbane, is also a big fan of body modification . She has stretched ears, a split tongue and dermals, which are piercings placed under the skin. To hone her look even further, Amber has splashed out on plastic surgery. She's braved a boob job and butt lift, as well as cosmetic procedures like lip filler. She opened up about her epic transformation previously, and said: \"Pictured on the left – a girl; at that stage feeling lost – feeling disconnected from herself. Pictured right – a woman; at that stage feeling turmoil; although resilience radiates. \"These two women had a choice. To be the person on the left and be miserably ignorant to my own wants and needs in life and was projecting hatred onto others - for the inner pain was too confrontational to stand. \"Or be the woman on the right - someone who dominates their brain and emotions and embraces charismatic traits. I am someone who takes accountability and responsibility. \"I am Amber Luke. You will either love it or f***in despise it.\" I'm a beauty lover and swear by these 6 Urban Decay products I've used for years",

        "content": "Recently, rumors were circulating on the web regarding the removal of PTA taxes on mobile phones. However, in a recent statement, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) clarified that there has been no official decision to remove taxes on mobile phones in Pakistan. Moreover, the national telecom regulator highlighted its role in verifying the technical standards of mobile phones for registration via after the payment of FBR taxes. It also clarified that the onus of implementing and collecting the mobile phone taxes lies with the Federal Board of Revenue, not the PTA. PTA also emphasized that non-PTA mobile users can temporarily register their mobile devices for 60 days while the relaxation for overseas Pakistanis is 120 days. Last year, the government launched a facility that enabled overseas Pakistanis to register their mobile phones tax-free through the Temporary Registration System for 120 days during each visit. This, however, is a temporary facility and does not illustrate a broader removal of FBR taxes on mobile phones. In addition, the telecom regulator advised the public to rely on official sources for updates to curb the spread of misinformation. It would lead to a decrease in the spread of fake news. For authentic updates on mobile taxes, citizens are urged to consult the FBR directly. PTA Taxes Portal Find PTA Taxes on All Phones on a Single Page using the PhoneWorld PTA Taxes Portal",

        "content": "According to , the Premier League champions have made up their mind to cut down on their losses and recoup some of the money they paid for the former Leeds United midfielder. The 28-year-old, who joined Pep Guardiola’s team in the summer of 2022, is two years into a six-year deal, and his future appears to be unresolved. He joined West Ham United on a loan deal in January but his move to the London Stadium has not worked. He made a number of high profile errors while playing for the Hammers and the fans did not approve of his performances during his time at the club. A permanent move to West Ham is unlikely for the midfielder. If Leeds United had got promoted to the Premier League, they would have targeted a move for their former player having received the financial backing of playing in the Premier League. However, they failed to get promoted after losing the Championship play-off final to Southampton. Another report from the revealed that the Premier League champions are looking to get £40million for the midfielder in the transfer window. His limited playing time during his spell at the Etihad Stadium has seen him lose his place in Gareth Southgate’s England team. Phillips was not included in the provisional England squad for the Euros announced by Southgate. Kalvin Phillips has struggled since joining Man City It is a huge decline in the career of the player, who was England’s Player of the year just a few years back. Leeds United will find it difficult to sign the fan favourite after failing to win their place back in the Premier League and Man City can now find it difficult to attract buyers for Phillips who would be willing to match their asking price. The midfielder’s future is uncertain and staying at the Etihad Stadium will hamper his progress as a player and put his career in further misery.",

En el ataque, los ebrios lograron herir a tres elementos, un oficial con el grado de comisario, un clase de Policía y un agente. Ante esta situación de alto riesgo y en un acto de legítima defensa, los funcionarios se vieron obligados a defenderse y proteger su vida en el momento en que los sospechosos intentaron desarmar a los agentes del orden. Como respuesta, los agentes abatieron a uno de los agresores de nombre Daniel Cristóbal Torres Turcios (58), resultando herido de bala otro civil, cuya identidad hasta ayer tarde no se había precisado. Minutos después los uniformados lograron someter a los otros atacantes. Después de la refriega, varios de los policías resultaron con heridas de gravedad con cortes de machete en los brazos, manos y torsos. Incluso, uno de ellos sufrió herida cortante en una pierna. Los policías fueron trasladados de inmediato a centros asistenciales en la capital, donde su condición sigue reservada. Lamentablemente uno de los policías corre el riesgo de perder la mano debido a la gravedad de las lesiones cortantes causadas por machete. “Este incidente resalta el alto precio que los miembros de la Policía Nacional pagan diariamente en su valiente labor de confrontar la delincuencia común y los peligros asociados a controlar a individuos violentos y armados bajo los efectos del alcohol”, explicó el jefe de comunicaciones y estrategias de la Secretaría de Seguridad, Miguel Martínez Madrid. “La valentía y sacrificio de nuestros funcionarios policiales reflejan el compromiso inquebrantable de la institución por mantener la seguridad y el orden en nuestras comunidades”, afirmó. La Policía Nacional reitera su llamado a la ciudadanía para colaborar en el mantenimiento del orden público y evitar situaciones de violencia que ponen en riesgo tanto a los ciudadanos como a los agentes encargados de su protección, instó. A la zona donde se dio el violento enfrentamiento entre fuerzas del orden y campesinos llegaron enardecidos parientes de los atacantes quienes alegaron que lo sucedido fue culpa de los policías. Varias mujeres indicaron que los uniformados instalaron el retén con la intención de exigir dinero a motoristas o las personas que regresaban en estado de ebriedad de la celebración municipal. “Ellos (policías) sabían cómo andaban estos muchachos, unos tomados y con armas, por eso los estaban esperando aquí en este retén”, señaló una de las féminas. “Si Daniel les salió con ese machete por qué no le dispararon a los pies, aunque se los hubiesen quebrado, sino que dispararon a matar”, repetía la enojada mujer.

        "content": "The 18-year-old attacking midfielder looks like a huge prospect and Romano has written for about the long list of clubs showing an interest in him this summer, even if it’s too early to be talking about anything concrete. Doue has been strongly linked with the likes of Man Utd and Arsenal by the , but it remains to be seen if we’ll definitely be seeing him making the move to a Premier League club. Romano says Doue is considered an exciting talent after his performances in Ligue 1, and there’s interest from a lot of different countries, so it seems this one remains open for the time being. “Staying with United, we’ve seen them linked, along with many other clubs, with Rennes wonderkid Desire Doue, who is doing fantastic with his performances in Ligue 1,” . “Honestly, though, I could mention six or seven clubs interested in Doue – interest is strong, but it’s really early. So we have to be patient on this one. For sure, interest is there from several countries as he’s considered a top, top talent.” Doue transfer: Should he pick Arsenal or United? If it does come down to a choice between Arsenal and United, one imagines choosing to link up with Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium would be a no-brainer. The Frenchman could be taking a huge risk going to the Red Devils right now, as so many top players have gone backwards at Old Trafford in this challenging post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Arsenal, by contrast, mostly seem to improve every player they sign at the moment, so they could be ideal to help Doue in his development, while there’s also the bonus of them having Champions League football on offer next season.",

It serves as an ideal haven for relaxation and summer enjoyment, complete with poolside dining. As we made our entrance, the hospitable marketing manager, along with Tulum’s Ariana, greeted us warmly. The pool looked inviting as Ariana handed us towels and bracelets, signifying that we were free to enjoy a dip in the pool whenever we wished. And even before we could take the plunge, we were treated to , which brought out the child within me. The Summer Club weekday menu features refreshing dishes and drinks to transport guests to a tropical paradise, from light and healthy options to indulgent treats. We started with their homemade guacamole and nachos, which is my ultimate comfort food – so satisfying that I could contentedly sit all day with just this and a beverage in hand. This delightful beginning was followed by a with black-eyed beans and avocado, topped with a hibiscus flower reduction, and the , a delectable mix of tender and savoury flank steak, crispy tortilla, avocado, beans, and cheese. Ariana handed us the beverage menu, but we requested a surprise, specifying a preference for little or no sugar. Soon after, two tiki glasses arrived: one with , a blend of hibiscus, cinnamon, rice milk, and raspberry puree, and the other with , combining pineapple, passion fruit puree, tarragon syrup, yuzu, and ginger ale – both drinks were perfect for the summer heat. Then it’s time for the main course: savoury , tender chicken encased in soft corn tortillas, accompanied by black beans, avocado, and sour cream, and the , a succulent grilled flank steak presented with halloumi cheese, sautéed corn, and Mexican rice, rounded out with pieces of tortilla. You can enjoy the dish on its own or create your own wrap with the steak. After such a hearty meal, a swim felt like the perfect choice. Hours later, refreshed from our time in the water, we returned to our table for the grand finale – a creamy and a , all while a live DJ set the vibe. Tulum is open to guests every day from noon until midnight.

В социальных сетях появилось видео, на котором несколько граждан в военной форме, а также сотрудники правоохранительных органов силой задерживают мужчину. По словам очевидцев, инцидент произошел в районе «Караваевых дач». Как сообщал сотрудник ТЦК Владимир Гренюх, на Украине по повестке в военкомат приходят только два процента граждан. По этой причине, добавил работник территориального центра комплектования, он поддерживает жесткие меры по мобилизации. Ранее о терроре сотрудниками военкомата населения в подконтрольном Киеву Херсоне рассказывал губернатор Херсонской области Владимир Сальдо. По его словам, работники ТЦК ловят людей «как зверей на улицах, на блокпостах, в квартирах и отправляют на убой».",

        "content": "Stand: 28.05.2024, 10:11 Uhr Von: Marian von Hatzfeld Gibt es bald eine neue Pflichtversicherung? NRW-Ministerpräsident Hendrik Wüst (CDU) drängt aktuell auf eine Regelung für Naturkatastrophen – warum? Dortmund – Flutkatastrophen, zerstörte Häuser und überschwemmte Straßen: Vielen in NRW dürften die Hochwasser-Bilder aus dem Ahrtal oder anderen Städten in NRW noch präsent sein. Nach dem aktuellen Vorfall im Saarland schlägt NRW -Ministerpräsident Hendrik Wüst jetzt Alarm. Er kritisiert die Bundesregierung und fordert eine Pflichtversicherung. NRW-Ministerpräsident Wüst will Pflichtversicherung für Millionen Bürger „Eine Pflichtversicherung für Elementarschäden würde nicht nur vielen Menschen Sicherheit geben und sie im Ernstfall vor dem wirtschaftlichen Ruin bewahren“, sagte er dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland. Wüst fügt hinzu: „Wir würden damit auch im Sinne des Steuerzahlers handeln, der nach den jetzigen Regelungen immer wieder für Milliarden-Schäden geradestehen muss. Das kann einfach nicht sein.“ Dann übt er scharfe Kritik. „Ist einfach nur fahrlässig“ – NRW-Ministerpräsident kritisiert Bundesregierung wegen Hochwasserkatastrophen „Dass wir sie zwei Jahre später immer noch nicht haben, ist einfach nur fahrlässig“, sagt Wüst über die Pflichtversicherung gegen die Folgen von Naturkatastrophen. Der Bundesrat hätte vor mehr als einem Jahr die bundesweite Einführung einer solchen Versicherung gefordert. Die Bundesregierung hätte die Regelung seinerzeit aber abgewehrt und eine zu hohe Belastung privater Haushalte befürchtet. Der NRW-Ministerpräsident sieht das anders und bescheinigt Tatenlosigkeit. Eine Belastung im Schadensfall könne vielfach höher und sogar existenzbedrohend sein. Hochwasser in NRW: „Länder haben Bund einstimmig aufgefordert rechtliche Grundlagen zu schaffen.“ Laut Wüst hätten die Länder den Bund einstimmig aufgefordert, rechtliche Grundladen für eine Pflichtversicherung zu schaffen. Dies sei auch eine Lehre aus der Hochwasserkatastrophe 2021. Jetzt scheint die Diskussion aber erneut Fahrt aufzunehmen (hier weitere News zu Geld und Finanzen aus NRW bei RUHR24 lesen). Laut der Deutschen Presseagentur (dpa) beraten sich die Länderchefs und Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD) am 20. Juni. Dabei geht es dann erneut um die Pflichtversicherung für Schäden durch Naturkatastrophen. Ministerpräsident Hendrik Wüst dürfte auch dann auf die Einführung hoffen. In NRW zeigt derweil eine Karte aktuelle Warnungen für die durch den Klimawandel steigende Hochwasser-Gefahr an.",

Stratégiai megállapodást kötött a Szerencsejáték Zrt. és az Ökumenikus Segélyszervezet A nagy nyereményhalmozódások nagyot lendítettek az állami szerencsejáték-vállalat bevételein: míg 2022-ben nem volt extrém főnyeremény-halmozódás, 2023-ban több is előfordult. Áprilisban kihúztak egy 4,57 milliárd forintos jackpotot, és ezt követően hamar elindult egy újabb halmozódás, ami 2024 februárjában, 29 hét halmozódás után minden idők legmagasabb, több mint 6,5 milliárd forintos ötöslottó-jackpotját eredményezte. Mager Andrea a nagy nyertesekre vonatkozó kérdés kapcsán elárulta: \"Én sem személyesen, sem írásban, azaz semmilyen módon nem találkoztam a nyertesekkel, nem is ismerhetem meg a kilétüket. Van lehetőségünk viszont arra, hogy anonimizált kérdőíven kérdezzük a nagynyerteseket, de ez esetben is az a tapasztalat, hogy nagyon szűkszavúak. Önkéntesen megadott válaszaik alapján tudjuk csak, hogy a legszűkebb körben tartják az információt, vagyis jellemzően csak a családdal osztják meg a nyeremény hírét. Játékszervezőként akkor járunk el felelősen, ha tiszteletben tartjuk ezt az igényt. A nyereményeket hazai bankszámlára utaljuk, és ebből is látszik, hogy a magyar bankrendszer kiválóan teljesít. Sehonnan ilyen hír nem került ki soha, ami a nagy nyertesre vonatkozott, és ehhez tartani fogjuk magunkat a jövőben is\" - magyarázta a Szerencsejáték Zrt. elnök-vezérigazgatója, aki azt is elárulta, 2024-ben a megjelenésükben is próbálnak változtatni, és hamarosan megnyitják a MOM Parkban az új típusú üzletüket, amely a jövő lottózója lesz. Emellett a trendeknek megfelelően frissítik az értékesítési modellt, és továbbra is fontosnak tartják az üzlethálózatot, a fizikai megjelenést. BLIKK DOSSZIÉ Szerencsejáték Zrt.",

        "content": "„Izgradnja dva bagera i pratećih sistema koja je u toku u „Kolubari“ jedan je od najvažnijih projekata u energetskom sektoru, a ukupne investicije u novu rudarsku opremu u EPS-u trenutno iznose više od 450 miliona evra. Ulaganja u rudarsku mehanizaciju treba da omoguće da otvaramo nove kopove, da dolazimo do novih količina uglja i boljeg kvaliteta ovog energenta. To je od vitalnog značaja za energetski sektor kako bismo imali i veću energetsku bezbednost i stabilnost proizvodnje uglja, a samim tim i naših termoelektrana“, rekla je ministarka nakon obilaska montažnog pogona Kalenić gde je u toku izgradnja rudarske opreme i novih bagera. Ona je dodala da se investicije odnose na nabavku nove i revitalizaciju postojeće rudarske opreme, otvaranje zamenskih proizvodnih kapaciteta, a sve sa ciljem obezbeđivanja neophodnih preduslova za nesmetanu eksploataciju uglja iz površinskih kopova. „Stavljanje u rad novih sistema za eksploataciju otkrivke, obezbediće dodatni proizvodnju u visini od 16 do 19 miliona kubika otkrivke na godišnjem nivou, čime se stvaraju uslovi da od 2026. godine započne eksploatacija uglja sa kopa Radljevo”, rekla je ona. Đedović Handanović je rekla da je ove godine proizvodnja uglja na nivou Kolubare veća za tri odsto u odnosu na isti period prethodne godine, dok je u proizvodnja otkrivke veća za 11 odsto na nivou Elektroprivrede Srbije. „Stav Vlade Republike Srbije je da želimo da održimo i osnažimo naš rudarski sektor i da obezbeđujemo bolje uslove za radnike na kopovima, a od svih zaposlenih očekujemo trud i rad u podizanju stepena proizvodnje“, dodala je ona. Ministarka je ukazala da ne očekuje probleme sa snabdevanjem električnom energijom u letnjim mesecima, ali da je potrebno da se nadgledaju remonti u EPS-u. „Deponije uglja su na nivou popunjenosti od 1,8 miliona tona, što uz dobre akumulacije vode treba da obezbedi sigurnost snabdevanja električnom energijom u narednom periodu. Činjenica je da je i leti potrošnja energije sve veća, zbog hlađenja, a događa se da imamo i pikove koji su veći nego tokom zime, zbog ekstremnih temperatura i rada industrijskih postojenja. EPS mora da nastavi da prati odvijanje svih remonta da bi se minimizirali rizici u vezi sa proizvodnjom i snabdevanjem električnom energijom”, rekla je ministarka.

Během rozhovoru s partnery ve vysílání Putinův propagandista Vladimir Solovjov sdělil, jak by si představoval útok na New York City. Odkazuje na konkrétní cíl. Od samého počátku války na Ukrajině „talk show“ ruské státní televize systematicky šíří propagandu proti NATO, Západu a všem údajným nepřátelům Ruska. Mezi nejznámějšími tvářemi, které podporují jsou , Olga Skabejevová, Olesya Loseva a . Na nové poselství ruské propagandy upozornil magazín . V rozhovorech se Solovjov obvykle vymezuje proti , vyzývaje opakovaně Putina, aby poslal tanky do západních hlavních měst a způsobil, aby Spojené království kleslo do moře díky jadernému útoku. Nedávno v jedné ze svých talkshow oznámil, jak by si představoval úder proti USA, jak už bylo popsáno v úryvcích zveřejněných ve službě X (dříve Twitter). \"Navrhuji poslat nad pevninu USA hypersonickou raketu, ale nepoužít ji proti USA, ale poslat ji přes ni,\" uvedl v rozhovoru se Solovjovem ruský politolog Dmitrij Evstafiev. Solovjov na tuto myšlenku reagoval s pobavením a předložil svůj vlastní ironický protinávrh: \"Ale zničit Sochu svobody, že?\" Další ruský politolog Dmitrij Kulikov však navrhl alternativu: \"Co kdybychom otestovali odpálení rakety z Atlantiku do Pacifiku a uvidíme, co se stane?\" a v současnosti zabírá přibližně pětinu sousední země. Ukrajina opakovaně zdůrazňuje, že stažení ruských vojsk z jejího území je podmínkou trvalého míru. Vladimir Putin tehdy označil tuto otevřenou válku za speciální vojenskou operaci a jeho jednotky pronikly za ukrajinsko-ruské hranice, čímž Kreml završil rusko-ukrajinskou krizi datující se od roku 2013. Tehdy v listopadu odmítl proruský prezident podepsat plánovanou Asociační dohodu s EU a naopak se chtěl zasloužit o rozšíření spolupráce s Ruskem. Odmítnutí ale vyvolalo masivní demonstrace na Majdanu a v roce 2014 za pomocí hnutí Euromajdan vedlo až ke státnímu převratu a útěku Janukovyče ze země. K moci se dostala prozápadní vláda, což Rusko neslo jen těžce, a ještě téhož roku .

Kiekvienas ras vietą Šaulių sąjungoje „Helsinkyje gyvenu penkerius metus ir puikiai matau suomių pasiryžimą ginti savo šalį. Noriu tikėti, kad visuotinė gynyba ir pasirengimas ekstremalioms situacijoms greitu metu taps savaime suprantamu dalyku ir Lietuvoje. Apsisprendžiant tapti šauliu ne paskutinėje vietoje buvo ir noras palaikyti stipresnį ryšį su Lietuva. Manau, kad dalyvavimas Šaulių sąjungos veikloje leis ne tik įgyti naujų įgūdžių, bet ir užmegzti naujus kontaktus su šauliais Lietuvoje ir kitose valstybėse“, – sako praėjusį penktadienį šaulio priesaiką davęs Mykolas Malskis. Architektu dirbantis vyras prisipažįsta, kad noras tapti šauliu neatsirado prieš savaitę ar mėnesį. Jis jau ir anksčiau domėjosi galimybėmis prisijungti prie Lietuvos šaulių sąjungos arba Krašto apsaugos savanorių pajėgų. „Kartais gyvenime viskas labai natūraliai stoja į savo vietas. Lietuvos Respublikos ambasada Suomijoje pranešė apie įvadinius mokymus norintiems prisijungti prie išeivijos šaulių. Sudalyvavau pirmose paskaitose, ir abejonių neliko. Labiausiai imponuoja tai, kad kiekvienas, nepaisant amžiaus, profesijos ar išsilavinimo, gali atrasti savo vietą Šaulių sąjungoje“, – pastebi naujasis šaulys, turintis įkvepiančių pavyzdžių ir artimoje aplinkoje tiek Lietuvoje, tiek Suomijoje. Mykolas nusiteikęs su broliais ir sesėmis šauliais pasidalyti savo žiniomis bei įgūdžiais, taip pat ir pats užsidegęs išmokti naujų dalykų. „Tikiu, kad rasiu sau tinkamą nišą Šaulių sąjungoje, nes veiklų spektras labai platus, – įsitikinęs vyras. – Vis paraginu savo draugus Lietuvoje tapti šauliais. Manau, kad ateityje ir Suomijoje gyvenantys tautiečiai labiau susidomės šauliškomis veiklomis.“ Šaulių tinklas užsienyje didėja „Šaulių sąjunga yra viena, kad ir kur būtum. Svarbiausia – piliečio noras stiprinti savo Tėvynę, nepamiršti savo gimtosios šalies istorijos ir tradicijų. Duodi šaulio priesaiką ir dirbi Tėvynės labui. Veikti tikrai yra ką, ypač dabar“, – sako Lietuvos šaulių sąjungos vadas plk. ltn. Linas Idzelis. Anot jo, užsienio šalyse gyvenančių lietuvių susidomėjimas Lietuvos šaulių sąjunga ypač suaktyvėjo Rusijai pradėjus karinę agresiją Ukrainoje. Lietuvos šaulių sąjungos paramos padalinys Ukrainoje įkurtas 2022 m. rudenį, netrukus susibūrė Liuksemburgo šaulių būrys, pernai – Belgijos ir Nyderlandų karalystės atskirasis šaulių būrys.

Itin aktyviai veikia šauliai Norvegijoje. Liepą daugiau kaip 20 lietuvių ruošiasi šaulio priesaikai Danijoje. JAV ir Kanadoje Lietuvos šaulių sąjunga išeivijoje veikia jau 70 metų – 1954 m. už Atlanto buvo atkurta Lietuvoje sovietų likviduotos Lietuvos šaulių sąjungos tradicijas ir veiklą tęsianti organizacija. Plėstis, telkti protus ir paramą Pagrindinis išeivijos šaulių siekis – būti integruotiems į šalies gynybos planus, kryptingai ruoštis ir, iškilus poreikiui, efektyviai prisidėti tiek teikiant pagalbą savo rezidencijos šalyse, tiek siunčiant paramą, ar net parengtų šaulių grupes į Lietuvą. Užsienio šalyse gyvenantys ir veikiantys šauliai siekia apjungti lietuvių bendruomenes, puoselėti lietuviškumą, skleisti informaciją apie Lietuvą bei patriotiškai ugdyti jaunuolius, gyvenančius ne tėvynėje. „Šaulių plėtra Europoje – ne tik nauji iššūkiai, bet ir naujos galimybės Lietuvos šaulių sąjungai. Daug lietuvių pasklidę po pasaulį, siūlydami naujas veiklas, pavyzdžiui, informacinių technologijų, dronų sektoriuose, tikimės pritraukti išeivių. Taip pat ketiname daugiau dėmesio skirti jaunųjų šaulių iki 18 metų pritraukimui ir lavinimui“, – planus atskleidžia Lietuvos šaulių sąjungos vado patarėjas LŠS padalinių užsienyje veiklai koordinuoti Laurynas Gerikas. Skirtingose Europos šalyse gyvenantys ir veikiantys šauliai jau dabar dirba su kibernetiniu saugumu besirūpinančios LŠS kuopos šauliais, dalyvauja bendrose pratybose, aktyviai remia Ukrainos laisvės kovotojus medicininėmis priemonėmis ir dronais bei jų detalėmis. Šiemet Europoje gyvenantys šauliai bei kiti aktyvūs lietuviai susibūrė į iniciatyvą „Wings for Europe“ („Sparnai Europai“) – įkūrė dronų surinkimo dirbtuves ir telkia paramą Ukrainai, siekdami įtraukti kuo daugiau europiečių. Be to, išeivijos šauliai braižo logistinius planus, kurie, iškilus poreikiui, padėtų tiek atsakingoms institucijoms dirbti išeivijoje, tiek apsaugotų vadovaujančių asmenų šeimas ar padėtų emigrantams. „Mūsų tikslas – plėstis išeivijoje, mokytis, telkti protus ir paramą viskam, kas didintų Lietuvos gynybinę galią“, – teigia L.

        "content": "Konečné poradie tímov na MS 2024 v Česku zmenilo postavenie jednotlivých reprezentácií v rankingu Medzinárodnej hokejovej federácie (IIHF). Česi sa ako čerství majstri sveta posunuli o štyri pozície, aktuálne im patrí štvrtá priečka. Slovensko po 7. mieste na MS 2024 zostalo na deviatej priečke. Na čele rankingu je Kanada so ziskom 4100 bodov. Druhé je Rusko, ktoré má po začatí vojenskej invázie na Ukrajine rovnako ako Bielorusko zákaz štartovať na medzinárodných turnajoch. Zborná napriek tomu v rebríčku stúpa. Môže za to nastavený systém IIHF. \"Rusom sa pripisujú body podľa jednoduchého kľúča. Namiesto reálneho umiestnenia na turnaji sa rieši iba ich „nasadenie“ podľa platného rebríčka. Ak sú pred štartom šampionátu v poradí IIHF na treťom mieste, ako tomu bolo napríklad v minulých dvoch rokoch, dostanú rovnako bodov ako skutoční bronzoví medailisti,\" vysvetľuje systém portál iDnes.cz . Z uvedeného vyplýva, že Rusi tento rok dostali rovnaký počet bodov ako tretie Švédsko, ktoré v súboji o bronz zdolalo Kanadu. Ak zostane nastavený systém v platnosti a Kanada na budúcoročných MS, ktoré sa uskutočnia v Dánsku a vo Švédsku, nezíska zlato alebo striebro, Rusi ju preskočia a dostanú sa v rebríčku na prvé miesto. Nastavenie systému kritizovali na sociálnych sieťach viacerí fanúšikovia. „Cirkus IIHF. Rusi vedú vojnu, zabíjajú Ukrajincov a napriek tomu stúpajú v rebríčku,“ napísal jeden z hokejových priaznivcov. „Hanba IIHF. Aktuálne ranking je smiešny, Rusi dostávajú body zadarmo,“ znela ďalšia z reakcií. Rebríček IIHF je dôležitý nielen pre nasadzovanie do skupín MS, ale aj pre priamy postup na zimné olympijské hry. Na ZOH 2026 v Miláne a Cortine d’Ampezzo sa už dávnejšie priamo kvalifikovalo najlepších osem tímov podľa vlaňajšieho rebríčka, plus Taliansko, ktoré má ako organizátor hier isté miesto. Slováci, aj v predchádzajúcom období ako deviaty tím rebríčka, sa tak zatiaľ chystajú hrať kvalifikáciu. Dostali právo organizovať turnaj záverečnej fázy, v D-skupine (29. augusta – 1. septembra na Zimnom štadióne Ondreja Nepelu v Bratislave) by sa mali stretnúť s Kazachstanom, Rakúskom a Maďarskom. Ak by IIHF rozhodla, že Rusko nemôže štartovať ani v Miláne, Slováci by sa na olympiádu kvalifikovali priamo. Lenže svetová federácia bude o tejto otázke debatovať až na budúci rok. Informáciu včera potvrdil šéf slovenského hokeja Miroslav Šatan. „O Rusoch sa bude debatovať na budúci rok vo februári. Čiže dlho po kvalifikácii, ktorú odohráme v auguste. Ak by Rusi v Miláne neštartovali, dostane sa tam najlepší tím z druhých miest v kvalifikácii,“ potvrdil Šatan.

        "content": "In occasione della solennità del Corpus Domini , nella serata di giovedì 30 maggio si terrà a Cremona la tradizionale celebrazione cittadina presieduta dal vescovo e al termine della quale si terrà la processione eucaristica per le vie della città. L’appuntamento quest’anno è a Borgo Loreto , nella chiesa della Beata Vergine Lauretana e S. Genesio, quale occasione per valorizzare ulteriormente il 4° centenario del Santuario lauretano di Cremona. Alle 21 nella chiesa parrocchiale di Borgo Loreto, la celebrazione eucaristica presieduta dal vescovo Antonio Napolioni e concelebrata dai sacerdoti della zona pastorale 3 e, dopo le comunioni, per le vie del quartiere si snoderà la processione eucaristica: dietro alla Croce i fedeli, seguiti dai religiosi, i ministranti, i sacerdoti concelebranti e, sotto il baldacchino, il vescovo Napolioni con il Santissimo Sacramento; infine le autorità cittadine con il Gonfalone della città. La processione percorrerà via Legione Ceccopieri, via Rosario, via Emanuale Sardagna, piazza Patrioti, via Carlo Cattaneo e di nuovo per via Legione Ceccopieri fino a raggiungere nuovamente la chiesa parrocchiale dove il vescovo impartirà la solenne benedizione eucaristica. “La proposta di celebrare il Corpus Domini a Borgo Loreto, nell’unità pastorale “Madre di Speranza”, – spiega don Pietro Samarini , vicario zonale della zona pastorale 3 – arriva direttamente dal vescovo, che ha chiesto che una delle due processioni cittadine annuali fosse fatta in periferia, per dare un segnale di una Chiesa “in uscita”. Da qui la scelta del quartiere di Borgo Loreto, anche per un’ulteriore motivazione. “Non solo potrà essere una concreta testimonianza di una Chiesa vicina alle realtà sociali e parrocchiali che si interfacciano con le fragilità delle situazioni di periferia – continua don Samarini –. È stata scelta la chiesa di Borgo Loreto, intitolata alla Beata Vergine Lauretana proprio nell’anno in cui ricorre il quarto centenario dalla costruzione del Santuario lauretano di Cremona”. La celebrazione è organizzata dalla Zona pastorale 3 e promossa con il supporto dell’unità pastorale “Madre di Speranza”, con l’intera comunità coinvolta nella preparazione e nella gestione dell’evento cittadino. Ad animare la Messa e la processione saranno, infatti, i cori delle parrocchie dell’unità pastorale.",

        "content": "Przykre wieści nadeszły zza oceanu. W wieku 71 lat zmarł Bill Walton, dwukrotny mistrz NBA, poinformowała ta organizacja. Były koszykarz, który od wielu zmagał się z chorobą nowotworową, odszedł w otoczeniu rodziny. Walton swoje pierwsze mistrzostwo zdobył w 1977 roku z Portland Trail Blazers, a następnie w 1986 roku z Boston Celtics, w tamtym momencie najlepszą drużyną ligi. \"Bill Walton był naprawdę jedyny w swoim rodzaju\" - stwierdził komisarz NBA Adam Silver w oświadczeniu, w którym przypomniano jego liczne osiągnięcia. \"To, co zapamiętam jednak najbardziej, to jego radość życia\" - dodał. Bill Walton był gwiazdą na swojej uczelni. Razem z Uniwersytetem Kalifornijskim wywalczył dwa mistrzostwa NCAA w latach 1972-73. Mierzący 211 cm koszykarz do NBA trafił w 1974 roku wybrany z pierwszym numerem przez Trail Blazers. Trzy lata później zdobył jedyne w historii zespołu mistrzostwo, a sam został wybrany najlepszym zawodnikiem finałów . W 1979 roku przeszedł do San Diego Clippers, pięć lat później przeniesionych do Los Angeles. Tam miał jednak problemy zdrowotne, opuszczając trzy z czterech kolejnych sezonów. W 1985 roku trafił do Celtics, z którymi od razu zdobył mistrzostwo NBA, drugie w karierze, a sam został wybrany najlepszym rezerwowym ligi . Mimo iż był graczem bardzo podatnym na kontuzje, szczególnie stóp, i z tego powodu nie w pełni wykorzystał swój potencjał, uchodzi za jednego z najwybitniejszych środkowych w historii ligi. W 1978 roku otrzymał tytuł MVP dla najlepszego zawodnika sezonu zasadniczego . Karierę zakończył w 1987 roku. Natomiast w 1996 znalazł się wśród 50 najlepszych graczy występujących kiedykolwiek w NBA. Po karierze sportowej odnalazł się mediach, zostając komentatorem. Był także konsultantem różnych sieci telewizyjnych, w tym CBS, NBC i ESPN. Jego syn Luke grał w NBA w latach 2003-2013 i również zdobył dwa tytuły mistrzowskie - z Los Angeles Lakers (2009, 2010). \"Nikola Jokić jest uważany za najbardziej utalentowanego środkowego, ale Walton był pierwszy. Był jednym z najbystrzejszych graczy. Bill był wspaniałym ambasadorem koszykówki uniwersyteckiej i NBA\" - hołd zmarłemu koszykarzowi złożył Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson , były gwiazdor Los Angeles Lakers.

        "content": "La conduttrice radiofonica Erica Bain è alla vigilia delle nozze con il suo fidanzato, il dottor David Kirmani. Una sera la coppia sta portando a spasso il cane nel parco cittadino quando si imbatte in tre balordi che li aggrediscono violentemente : ad avere la peggio è l’uomo che, in seguito alle ferite riportate, muore su un letto d’ospedale . Erica sopravvive e qualche settimana dopo fa ritorno a casa ma è profondamente scossa, con il terrore di uscire che la attanaglia. Dopo averlo superato, prende una drastica decisione e compra una pistola illegalmente , con l’intenzione di usarla per eliminare dalla città i criminali. Il suo battesimo del fuoco è in un minimarket dove lei si trovava per puro caso, nel quale uccide un ladro che aveva appena sparato al proprietario. Sarà soltanto l’inizio della sua segreta attività da vigilante , mentre nel frattempo le indagini della polizia, affidate al detective Sean Mercer, brancolano nel buio. Definito come una sorta di liberissimo remake di un grande classico del cinema di genere come Il giustiziere della notte (1972), il film diretto nel 2007 da Neil Jordan vede nei panni della spietata e implacabile giustiziera un’intensa Jodie Foster , principale punto di forza di una visione sicuramente non banale ma al contempo imperfetta. Il regista irlandese di Intervista col vampiro (1994) e Michael Collins (1996) si approccia al tema della vendetta sacrificando la città di New York all’altare della denuncia, con i frequenti voice-over della protagonista che ci ricordano come la Grande Mela , dietro il lusso dei grattacieli e di Wall Street, nasconda un sottobosco criminale che si agita nelle periferie e nei vicoli poco bazzicati. Quando la gente non si sente più sicura ecco che prende in mano le armi, con l’intento di ripulire la metropoli dalla feccia: ne Il buio dell’anima Erica ha una causa scatenante, quel drammatico pestaggio, del quale lei è stata co-vittima e testimone, nel quale ha perso la vita il suo grande amore. Nelle due ore di visione si cerca di coniugare l’anima più tensiva e adrenalinica con l’aura melodrammatica, un tentativo riuscito soltanto a metà. Indubbiamente alcune sequenze sono ad alto tasso di suspense , capaci di lasciare con il fiato sospeso lo spettatore che si identifica, volente o nolente, con questa anti-eroina sui generis , ma in generale la pellicola soffre di una certa disomogeneità narrativa , con alcuni tempi morti e un paio di figure secondarie non sfruttate abbastanza. Allo stesso modo il detective di Terrence Howard avrebbe meritato una miglior caratterizzazione per poter risultare anche credibile. Ne Il buio nell’anima – disponibile su Netflix – la morale dell’occhio per occhio, controversa e non sempre condivisibile, finisce qui nelle mani di una donna comune, cittadina modello fino a quel traumatico evento che ha irrimediabilmente rovinato il suo mondo. Veicolo empatico o antitetico a seconda dei punti di vista, ma sguardo sicuramente interessante sul tema anche se approcciato come detto in un film non privo di difetti. Dal paradiso all’inferno nell’arco di una notte, con quel brutale pestaggio che le ha tolto per sempre la sua dolce metà. E quando il dolore e la paura sembrano una costante, la vendetta riaccende nella protagonista l’istinto di vivere, trasformandola in un vigilante sui generis pronta a diventare l’incubo dei criminali di una New York senza speranza. Non è un film perfetto Il buio nell’anima , a tratti fin troppo esplicativo nel suo approccio giustizialista, ma la tensione palpabile in molti frangenti e la struggente performance di Jodie Foster permettono di chiudere un occhio su una sceneggiatura non sempre coesa e a tratti verbosa, che tramite i voice-over mette a nudo le ombre di una metropoli che non dorme mai .",
