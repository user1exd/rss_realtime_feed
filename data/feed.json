        "content": "Voting at one of the busiest voting stations in Nelson Mandela Bay proceeded at a snail's pace during the special voting sessions on Monday. At Sherwood NG Kerk, in Gqeberha, the voting station was still packed an hour after the gates closed at 17:00, with close to 200 cars still parked on and outside the premises. For a visibly upset Johan Theron, 59, the \"nightmare\" was too much. \"We spent four-and-a-half hours waiting to vote,\" he said, pointing to his watch. \"This whole process was a nightmare because the people here are pathetic. They don't have their ducks in a row and wasted precious time.\" According to Theron, some voters who arrived when the voting station opened at 09:00 only left around 17:00. He said there were several delays, one of which was a voters' roll not in alphabetical order, leading to a chaotic search for voters' names. \"They tried to search for people's names and went through 79 pages to find it, but were unsuccessful anyway. At one point, the machines were offline, and they just sat there and did nothing.\" READ | Elections 2024: Smooth start to the casting of special votes, says IEC Theron said at 16:00, an hour before the voting station was supposed to close, there were still around 200 people waiting in the queue. \"We registered for special voting, thinking it would go quicker, but not at all. If I had to describe this day in one sentence, I would say it was a waste of time.\" Valerie Theron added: \"We heard that things went better at other voting stations but, at this one, there were too many names on the list that they couldn't find. \"They had three ballot boxes, and only added two more around 14:00.\" For Sonja York, the situation was made worse as her children were waiting for her. She said she had arrived at the voting station around 16:00 and, two hours later, she had still not entered the building. \"I have no choice, but to stay in the queue until my turn because I can't come tomorrow. I'm just worried about how long it will take since my children are at home waiting for me.\" York said she looked forward to voting and having her voice heard, but when it came to \"poor planning\", it did not feel worth it. \"I was at Sunridge [voting station], and it was empty there, but I can't vote there because I live here in Sherwood.\" ROLLING COVERAGE | Elections 2024: Anticipation builds as all stations prep for voters making their mark York said she had parked her car across the road at the shopping complex, thinking she would be back soon. However, she rushed to her car as soon as it became dark otherwise the complex's gate would close, leaving her stranded. \"The long wait was irritating. I have a family and kids at home. I have responsibilities to take care of.\" No party agents were present outside the voting station. News24 was not allowed inside the venue after 17:00. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) reported a smooth start to the casting of special votes on Monday, despite some glitches resulting in voting stations opening late in parts of the country. The first official day of voting inside the country was marred by isolated protests - in the Eastern Cape and parts of Gauteng - and there were reports of voting stations failing to open, but the IEC indicated that only 0.1% of those casting their votes experienced problems doing so. Special votes continue on Tuesday, ahead of the election day for the rest of the country on Wednesday, with polls opening at 07:00.",

        "content": "SHOPPERS have announced a new list of demands as a grocery store threatens to shut down and leave residents in a food desert. Customers are continuing to protest the closure of a Hy-Vee location in Ceder Rapids, Iowa , following the grocer's announcement that it would be coming up with alternatives to ease the transition. A dozen people were seen protesting the closure, which would leave the town in a food desert. Shoppers were holding signs that said \"You deserted us,\" and \"Boycott Hy-vee\" in front of the Oakland Road location. “By educating our entire community of Cedar Rapids we’re hoping more people will show up for those who are directly impacted by the first avenue Hy-Vee closure,” Angelina Ramirez, the vice president of Advocates for Social for Justice, told local ABC affiliate KCRG. Hyvee announced that its 1st avenue store will be one of three that will be shutting down in Iowa. The announcement has left many residents in the are nervous, as they could possibly become a food desert. This occurs when there are no nearby stores for people to get healthy, fresh food. To help shoppers in the area, Hy-Vee announced that it will be providing a shuttle service from the closed location to the nearest location three days a week until September 1 The location will also continue to offer free pharmacy deliveries and free grocery deliveries to those located within a mile radius from the store. However, protesters are still not happy with the change. They have demanded the store stay open until September, pay the local activist to canvas the surrounding area, and guarantee another grocery store will go into the Hy-vee location. As of now, the grocery store has not commented on the group's recent demands. The store will officially shut down on June 23, and the company has released a statement ahead of the closure. \"No business wants to close a location and that certainly includes Hy-Vee,\" a spokesperson for the company wrote. \"Over the past several weeks, we have listened to community leaders and residents about the impact of our store closures After a meeting with the Mayor, Hy-Vee has announced how it could help the community moving forward. \"Unfortunately, these three stores have each been losing significant amounts of money for several years, and they are simply not feasible for us to operate any longer.” Community leaders have applauded Hy-Vee for how it handled the closure. \"Our meeting with community leaders last week identified priorities to ensure residents can continue to access essential services after the store closes,\" Mayor Tiffany O’Donnell said in a statement \"We brought these concerns to our meeting with Hy-Vee, focusing on things like grocery delivery charges, no-cost pharmaceutical deliveries, and partnerships with transportation providers and local food-access services for additional assistance during the transition. \"It was a positive meeting. We will continue to support efforts to address these challenges and meet our community’s needs.” City Manager Jeff Pomeranz also praised the company for its collaborative efforts. \"They focused on supporting our community members during the transition, and the discussion led to several promising solutions,\" Pomeranz said in a statement. \"Hy-Vee also indicated they are working with the property owner to avoid vacancy after the store’s closure and they will not place any use restrictions on the location, which is a positive sign. \"We are encouraged by their cooperation and hope we can continue working with them to ensure a smooth transition for our residents.”",

        "description": "Getty ImageJohn Mayer has had some very Bill Walton moments with the late basketball icon and Grateful Dead enthusiast.",
        "content": "The sports world was met with sad news today, May 27: Bill Walton, basketball hall-of-famer and NBA legend, after a battle with cancer. This is a noteworthy loss for the music world, too: If you know two things about Walton aside from his basketball achievements, one is that he had an unceasingly optimistic and offbeat personality. The other is that he was perhaps the world’s biggest (both in terms of enthusiasm and physical size) Grateful Dead fan. Naturally, when — an offshoot band featuring some original Grateful Dead members, , and others — launched nearly a decade ago, Walton was all in. This means Mayer has gotten to know Walton a bit, and back in 2023, he spoke about his experiences with the sports icon. Mayer was Walton’s guest on an interview-style NBA broadcast in January 2023, and he reminisced about Walton speaking to him before taking the stage for a Dead & Company show. It was very Bill Walton. Mayer said, “You know, it’s really just him being very laser-sharp. When Bill gives you advice, he looks you dead in the eye and everything stops, and he speaks with this cadence: ‘Go out there, give it your absolute all. Don’t be shy, they are here to watch you play. Go play to the greatest of your ability.'” \"Some of the greatest compliments I've ever been given were from Bill Walton.\" John Mayer on the advice and support Bill has shared with him over the years. 📲 — NBA (@NBA) Mayer also noted that Walton gave him “some of the greatest compliments I’ve ever been given,” including “some very nice things that sent me on stage with a lot of confidence.” Dead & Company, by the way, is in the midst of . Check out the Mayer/Walton clip above and revisit more of the broadcast below. Basketball fans have also been sharing their favorite clips of Walton, so find some of those .",

        "content": "JAZZ Jennings has shown she's confident in her body as she flaunted her body transformation in new photos. The TLC star posted a couple of snapshots on Instagram of her donning a swimsuit while enjoying the warm weather. In one pic, Jazz, 23, captured an up-close shot of her sporting a plunging black bathing suit while basking in the sunshine. She stared directly at the camera with her long brunette locks flowing down her back. A second pic showed Jazz smiling alongside her friend, Sam, while seemingly at a playground. Sam also rocked a black outfit and her brown hair fell to her shoulders. \"Radiate Love,\" Jazz wrote in her caption before giving a shoutout to her \"best friend.\" \"Oh god u r magnificent,\" one fan commented, while another gushed over her \"beautiful\" appearance. The YouTuber has been regularly flaunting her thinner figure on social media since dropping 70 pounds. Last month, the Florida native showcased her smaller waistline , by sharing a full-body photo of her sporting tiny shorts and a t-shirt. She noted in her caption that she was \"improving every day,\" which fans, including her older brother Sander, praised in the comments. \"Looking amazing! So proud of you for reaching towards your progress goals and continuing to work to be the healthiest and happiest version of you,\" her 26-year-old sibling wrote. The I Am Jazz star has been vocal about her health journey after gaining weight due to binge eating. Jazz previously revealed she packed on more than 100 pounds after turning to food to deal with her depression battle. \"I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today,\" the TV personality said during a 2021 confessional interview on her show. \"I do experience fat-shaming from my family,\" she admitted, and added that it made her \"feel really humiliated.\" I gained weight and more weight and more weight. And now, almost 100 lbs. heavier, here I am today. Earlier that year, Jazz opened up on Instagram about her \"addiction to food\" and how she would typically \"eat in large quantities.\" The TV star appears to have a much better relationship with her body . In January, she beamed in another Instagram pic that she was \"feeling sexy\" while wearing a revealing black and white top. Shortly before, Jazz confessed to her followers that she was ready to be in a relationship after being single for five years. \"I'm so open to finding love, and I know it'll come,\" she shared after a fan inquired about her love life. \"I'll continue to be patient in the knowing that it'll happen when I'm ready,\" the spokesmodel added. Jazz rose to fame after starring in TLC's reality series, I Am Jazz, which documented her navigating through her teenage years as a transgender female. She also wrote about her experiences in her memoir, Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen, and is an LGBT rights activist.",

Following the win, players and staff celebrated in the dressing room, with footage showing the post-match scenes. In a video shared to the club's official Instagram, Marcus Rashford can be seen smiling and jumping up and down. He also joined team-mate Lisandro Martinez in song to the delight of supporters. The local lad has been linked with an exit this summer but there have been plenty of calls for him to stay. Paris Saint-Germain have previously held interest in the United academy graduate. The forward has been omitted from Gareth Southgate 's provisional 33-man Euro 2024 squad. It will give him time to rest and reset ahead of Manchester United's next campaign.",

        "content": "KUWAIT: Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdullah Al-Yahya on Monday held in-depth discussions with Chinese officials dealing with means of boosting relations in execution of mega development ventures. The minister, according to a statement released by the foreign ministry, received Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Zhang Jianwei, with the attendance of the head and members of a Chinese government delegation tasked with completing consultation on joint development projects. The meeting with the visiting Chinese officials was held at the ministry headquarters, the official statement said, noting that the two sides explored the close bilateral relations and strategic cooperation between Kuwait and China, where they also broached “frameworks of boosting and promoting the relations in various sectors and at diverse levels”. The two sides held in-depth discussions, focusing on the necessity to cement technical, development and economic ties in the realm of executing mega development projects in Kuwait. Moreover, they addressed the need to offer proposals and the aspired perceptions for attaining aspirations of the supreme political leadership to press ahead with laying the foundations of a future plan to launch common strategic ventures, namely Mubarak Al-Kabeer Port. — KUNA China will host a number of other Arab leaders in Beijing this week, its foreign ministry said Monday. The leaders will from Tuesday to Saturday “pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. Among the delegation will be Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li said President Xi Jinping would attend the forum and deliver a keynote address on Thursday. Xi would also “hold talks with the four heads of state respectively to exchange views on bilateral relations and regional and international issues of common concern”, Deng said. The forum would aim to deepen “consensus between China and Arab countries”, Deng said, and would be co-chaired by top diplomat Wang Yi and his Mauritanian counterpart. They would also “issue a common voice between China and Arab countries on the Palestinian issue”, he said. China has sought to build closer ties with Arab states in recent years, and last year brokered a detente between Tehran and its long-time foe Saudi Arabia. The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China seeks to position itself as a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and the Zionist entity. China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict. And Xi has called for an “international peace conference” to resolve the fighting. – Agencies",

        "description": "Love Island star Ekin-Su Culculoglu was one of the stars taking part in ITV's 2024 season of Celebrity Big Brother - but things did not turn out well for her during her time on the show",
        "content": "Ekin-Su Culculoglu has addressed the fact she failed to turn up to the grand final of ITV ’s revived Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year. The 29-year-old Love Island star was one of the 13 celebrities that entered the Most Famous House In Britain in March and she had high hopes of being able to show a new side of herself to fans. Plans backfired somewhat, however, as Ekin-Su sparked bitter arguments in the house, appeared obsessed with not being recognised for her Love Island fame, and clashed with show hosts AJ Odudu and Will Best after she was voted out of the house as she tried to blame producer’s editing the show to make her look bad. Now Ekin-Su has opened up about her disastrous turn on the series and says she couldn’t make it to the live final as she was struggling to cope with bombshell news that ex-boyfriend Davide Sanclimenti, 29, had cheated on her. The British-Turkish actress has conceded that her time in the house was nothing short of a disaster, but has rejected the suggestion that this was the reason behind her finale no-show. In the last episode of the season, where Ibiza Weekender star David Potts , 31, was crowned winner, former housemates were invited to return to review their time on the show. Businessman Gary Goldsmith was also absent from the finale, but there is speculation his decision to not appear was down to his niece, Catherine, Princess of Wales , battling cancer. Ekin-Su's time on the reality show was tarred by bitter arguments ( Image: ITV1) Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Speaking to The Sun, Ekin-Su said: “I should never have gone into the Big Brother house. I was angry, hurt, maybe a bit bitter, definitely insecure – Big Brother is not where you go to heal heartache, let me tell you. I went into the show thinking that I could rebuild myself after everything that happened with Davide, but I came off worse. My guard was up.” She continued: “I blame myself for making a poor choice in my career. People could see that I wasn’t myself, and I can understand why they thought I was being fake.” And she added: “I never wanted to believe the allegations against Davide but people would tell me I was being cheated on all the time. I was so scared of being alone, and I didn’t know who the hell Ekin-Su was meant to be without him.” Cheating accusations have ruined the once strong romance on both sides. As fans will already be aware, Ekin-Su and Davide won the eighth season Love Island in 2022 and their romance flourished outside of the house. However, their relationship turned sour after 11 months and they broke up. Davide has accused Ekin-Su of cheating on him with a fellow contestant on the USA version of The Traitors which sees celebrities taking on tasks and trying to avoid betrayal. It has been alleged that Ekin-Su developed a romance with The Bachelorette star Peter Weber on the show - an accusation she has fiercely rejected. Hitting out at the suggestion on Monday, Ekin-Su said: “It’s absolutely not true. I made friends with a lot of people I was with on Traitors. I’ve always been a faithful to Davide.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ola Olukoyede, has expressed sadness over the passing of one his predecessors, Ibrahim Lamorde, a retired deputy inspector general of police. In a statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, Mr Olukoyede said Mr Lamorde, who led the EFCC from 2012 to 2015, passed away at the age of 61 in Egypt on Saturday. “The loss of this distinguished law enforcement officer whose ideals and accomplishments we have long respected, is painful coming at a time the EFCC and indeed Nigeria still needed his wealth of experience to deal with emerging challenges in the law enforcement environment,” he said. He said Mr Lamorde made significant contributions to the EFCC and the Nigeria Police, where he spent his most productive years. “Mr Lamorde’s demise comes at a time when the EFCC and Nigeria greatly needed his wealth of experience to tackle emerging law enforcement challenges,” Mr Olukoyede noted. He said Mr Lamorde’s tenure at the EFCC included roles as director of operations, acting chairman, and substantive chairman. The statement explained that he was instrumental to establishing EFCC’s investigation machinery and mentoring the corps of officers who are now pivotal to the commission’s investigative activities.

He was also a reformist, and his legacy in the Commission includes the establishment of the Department of Internal Affairs, recently renamed the Department of Ethics and Integrity, and the Department of Public Affairs to drive the Commission’s corruption prevention mandate,” Mr Olukoyede stated. The EFCC chairman said Mr Lamorde renamed the EFCC’s Training and Research Institute in Karu to EFCC Academy, expanding its mandate to train all cadres of officers from the EFCC and other law enforcement agencies across Nigeria and Africa. He said the EFCC Academy has become a central hub for anti-corruption training in West Africa. The EFCC Chairman noted that Mr Lamorde’s lifetime of service as a police officer and statesman would remain a legacy of inspiration. “All of us in the EFCC feel deeply the loss of this soldier of anti-corruption. Our hearts are with his family and all those whose lives he impacted in his remarkable career. We share your bereavement in the loss of this icon. You can be assured that our thoughts and prayers are with you in your grief,” he stressed. The commission prays for the repose of Mr Lamorde’s soul and comfort for his family, the EFCC, and the entire nation. President Bola Tinubu, earlier on Sunday, expressed condolences to the family of Mr Lamorde. In addition to offering sympathies to the family, President Tinubu extended his condolences to the associates of the former anti-graft czar as well as to the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the government and people of Adamawa State.

        "description": "In response to an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, Japan is looking for ways for humans and animals to co-exist.",
        "content": "On 18 October 2023, in Kita-Akita, a regional city 700km north of Tokyo, local candy store owner Keiji Minatoya was starting his day when a young woman came running from his backyard screaming: \"There's a bear!\" \"I’d lived here for many decades but never seen a bear inside town,\" 66-year-old Minatoya thought and went back inside to continue working on making his butter mochi (a sweet treat). But when he finished work for the day and opened his garage door, he found himself face-to-face with an Asiatic black bear. Staring into the eyes of the 1.8m tall animal, Minatoya's survival instinct kicked in. He ran as fast as he could, but the bear caught up to him and pinned him to the ground before clawing at his face and body. \"I thought I was going to die,\" Minatoya recalled. \"The attack was vicious, so fast, so powerful — it was terrifying.\" Then suddenly the bear stopped its attack, and Minatoya was able to get into his house and call for help. On the same day, a record six people were attacked in Kita-Akita, sending shockwaves across the country. Most frightening of all was that these attacks were not isolated incidents. Source: SBS / Dateline Japan is experiencing an unprecedented surge in bear attacks, with the highest number reported in more than a century. Last year alone, 212 people were attacked by Japanese black or brown bears resulting in six deaths. The Akita prefecture has been particularly hard-hit, with 70 attacks recorded last year, more than anywhere else in the country. The alarming rate of attacks has authorities scrambling to find solutions to keep communities safe. Professor Koji Yamazaki from the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology is one of Japan’s leading experts on bears. His team has been tasked by the government with determining why there were so many attacks in 2023. He says unseasonably high temperatures in autumn last year caused a dramatic decrease in the harvest of the acorns and fruits that bears need to survive in winter. \"With bears, usually the most vital time of year is September. It is a very important period when they consume a lot of food to accumulate their body fat before hibernation,\" Yamazaki explained. Desperate and starving, bears travelled unusually close to towns and villages in search of food. \"If bears eat food scraps that are left near human dwellings, they come back.\" \"Bears also want an easy life like humans. Once they learn an easy way, they won’t give it up.\" Source: Getty / Petesphotography/iStockphoto Another factor contributing to the increasing encounters between bears and people is Japan’s population decline. The Japanese term 'satoyama' refers to areas between mountains and arable flatlands, traditionally used for rice cultivation and forestry. But as more people abandoned agricultural practices and moved away, it has become easier for bears to come closer to villages and towns. \"Mountainous regions, in particular, have seen progressive depopulation and aging population. As a result, bears have more space for their activities,\" Yamazaki said. As the borders between humans and bears blur, the Japanese government has responded by launching a nationwide bear safety program. From public safety videos teaching people how to survive bear attacks to utilising AI technology to monitor bears’ movement patterns, Japan has committed to a variety of measures to inform and keep citizens safe. However, one of the more controversial courses of action is the Japanese government’s new mass culling campaign. In April this year, black bears were placed on the animals designated for control list in the Akita prefecture, meaning hunters can kill bears without restriction and for a bounty. The government has also introduced subsidised ammunition and carcass removal for bear hunters. While the initiative has been welcomed in towns like Kita-Akita, where bear encounters have become particularly common, other communities are searching for solutions that embrace humans and the natural world living in harmony together. Source: SBS / Dateline In Karuizawa, a town 150km west of Tokyo, Picchio Wildlife Research Center has introduced an innovative bear dog program that allows bears and humans to coexist in their respective territories. First developed at the Wind Bear Institute in the United States, the bear dog program aims to make bears afraid of humans by tracking bear movements and when they get close to human dwellings use the dogs to chase the bear away by barking. \"Because humans and bears live so close, in order to coexist, we need to separate our respective territories,\" said dog handler Junpei Tanaka. Tanaka works with Tama, his Karelian Bear Dog, a breed native to Finland known for its ability to hunt brown bears. \"With the help of dogs, we teach bears that humans are dangerous so that the bears that live here stay away from humans.\" Source: SBS / Dateline Since the program’s launch in 2004, it has reported an extraordinary reduction in the damages and incidents involving bears. There have been no bear attacks in town for over a decade, according to Amelia Hiorns, a researcher from Picchio. \"Our management system involves a variety of mitigation techniques. So, the bear dogs, electric fences, bear-proof bins and a community engagement program so that people can understand how to kind of interact and coexist with nature as well,\" Hiorns said. \"We have to accept the bears as much as we can. And obviously [bears] have to accept humans to an extent as well. \"Then I think it is possible to coexist. It's not necessarily going to ever be like perfect harmony, more of a compromise. And that's probably the best way we can do it,\" she said. Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Dateline is an Australian award-winning international documentary series.

'Can you pinpoint it on Google Maps?'\" she told Insight. \"I realised I was sort of creating a roadmap for tourists and influencers.\" While she may have taken the photo with a drone, having got all the right permissions, the average person trying to replicate such a picture could be putting their lives in danger, she said. \"Photographers like me were taking photos and geotagging and hashtag tagging them, which was creating a wave of popularity in certain locations with tourists or others who wanted to go and capture those images. \"I was part of the problem.\" Monique Sherar knows all too well the perils of accessing dangerous places to take a photo. One beautiful day after lots of rain she was at Empress Falls in the NSW Blue Mountains. She wanted to capture the view but didn't plan to take a selfie. In the end she fell before she even had the chance to take a photo. \"One minute I was walking on the track and the next minute I was tumbling through the air,\" she told Insight. \"I just remember hitting the ground and having this full-body burning sensation. Just like a pain that I never felt before.\" After an eight to 10-metre fall, Monique landed in water at the base of a waterfall. \"It was this compounding pain, water, cold, fear and just anxiety of this overwhelming thing that had happened in a split second.\" Monique had friends with her who were able to get help quickly. While she miraculously avoided any internal bleeding or head injuries, she sustained multiple fractures. She had to have a hip replacement and now has only 50 per cent movement and strength in her left arm. Source: Supplied She says she's become more cautious since the accident. \"I think that I'll always still want to get those photos and get that nice view but now I have a calculated approach to adventure. That thrill-seeking nature of me has left.\" Sergeant Dallas Atkinson, who leads the Police Rescue team in the Blue Mountains, says he's noticed an increase in the volume of people getting out in nature. “I guess it’s a by-product of COVID and being locked away for so long. People are pushing the boundaries a bit more and going into remote locations, without the full appreciation of the dangers,\" he told Insight. Atkinson says the internet and social media now make it easy for people to get directions, though many are ill-prepared for what they may find. “Unfortunately, some people who are going down that path don’t have adequate experience or knowledge ... Nature is also unpredictable so if things go pear-shaped people can be stuck in the middle of nowhere without a lifeline, waiting and hoping to be rescued.\" Source: Supplied / Dani Watson Last year, Samuel Cornell from the University of NSW published the first Australian study of selfie-related deaths, with 379 recorded between 2008 and 2021. \"There's a strong allure on social media for people to get content ... and there's an intrinsic reward for doing so,\" he said. \"Many of these places are in beautiful locations, but also quite hazardous locations. They're hard to rescue people from.\" Cornell believes taking selfies in dangerous places isn't just foolish, it's a public health hazard in the same category as smoking or road traffic accidents and needs to be taken seriously. He has researched the effectiveness of using location-based social media safety messaging to reduce injuries and fatalities at certain locations, and suggests social media influencers could also be useful in sharing the risks. \"We might need to look at using social media influencers to convey safety messages on TikTok and other platforms,\" he said. Photographer Dani's realisation that she was part of the problem led her to start a research project at Melbourne's RMIT University called InstaFame. In it, she documented the risks photographers and tourists were taking in the quest for the perfect pic. As part of her project, she was photographed in dangerous locations, including at the Grampians National Park in Victoria. “Even though weather conditions were perfect, there was no wind and I had a rope nearby ... I remember saying to the friend who was with me that I don’t think I’ve ever felt so uneasy about something. There was nothing under me. I don’t think that enters some people's minds.\" Dani also recognised the toll that so-called selfie tourism was taking on nature. “When I re-visited a location at Trentham Falls in Victoria where I’d taken photographs two years earlier, it was evident the entire spot was decimated. All the lush ferns were gone and walking paths had been carved through the landscape.\" Source: AAP / PR IMAGE But one of the more \"horrific\" things Dani witnessed was at the Sea Cliff Bridge, a popular tourist attraction in the NSW Illawarra region that has become a notoriously dangerous selfie spot and the scene of numerous rescues over the years. \"This guy had rented a minibus and was doing selfie tours. He just parked at the bottom of Sea Cliff Bridge, pointed the way up, and these tourists with no knowledge of the area walked up this goat track to take selfies. \"They walked back down the same way, slipping and sliding, some were only wearing thongs or barefoot. It seemed to me that the tourist operator was profiting from this selfie culture”. A group of photographers took Dani up the same way through the steep cliffs. \"Once I got to the top I was like, 'why?' It’s a great view, but why would you take that risk?\" 22/02/2024 01:00 Share facebook twitter instagram youtube Insight is Australia's leading forum for debate and powerful first-person stories offering a unique perspective on the way we live. facebook twitter instagram youtube 6 min read",

He was inaugurating the award presentation ceremony of ONV Sahitya Award organized by ONV Cultural Academy on the occasion of ONV's 93rd birthday. \"Both of them who won the Jnanpith Award have depicted the miseries of women and stood for their upliftment. Both spoke for the environment as well. I am proud to present the award named after ONV, a staunch advocate of the progressive movement, to a writer who has brought her mother tongue Odia to the world,\" said the Chief Minister. Adoor Gopalakrishnan, film director and president of the academy, presided over the function. Pratibha Ray was awarded the Literary Award by the Chief Minister for her original contribution to the field of literature. The award consists of three lakh rupees, a sculpture and a citation. Durga Prasad received the Yuva Sahitya Award, which includes Rs 50,000, a sculpture and a citation. Poet Prabhavarma read the citation. Balan Nambiar, who made the sculpture, was given Ponnada by the Chief Minister. ONV's wife Sarojini Amma, family members, Aparna Rajeev, Cultural Academy office bearers Karamana Hari, G Rajmohan, EM Najeeb, MB Sanilkumar and others were present. Kerala is like my second home: Pratibha Ray Pratibha Ray, who received the award, said that Kerala, the birthplace of writers who have made unique contributions to the field of literature, is her second home. \"ONV was a man among poets and a poet among men. He came to honour me at a function in the past. He came as a sign of respect for me despite having many physical disabilities. From there he went straight to the hospital. A writer has no free language, love is his language,\" said Pratibha Ray.",

        "content": "HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “ Special Hearts in the Arts ” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Trevino has been selected as the first Most Valuable Philanthropist of the year by the MLBPA Players Trust and is receiving a $5,000 grant for Special Hearts. Trevino was selected for the award over more than a dozen other applicants by a panel of four former players. Amy Hever, the director of the Players Trust, said its focus is to help players create more impact for causes in their communities. “So, this is a way to not only recognize them, but it also raises tremendous awareness for these causes, especially these hyper-local causes and organizations that some would argue are doing the greatest work in their local communities,” Hever said. Davis raved about Trevino’s generosity and the special bond he’s built with the group. Trevino often visits Special Hearts in the offseason and the students rave about meeting him and covet the pictures he’s taken with them. “You’ll never have anyone say anything bad about Jose,” Davis said. “I think he just makes people feel worthy of whatever they do. That’s a Jose thing that he does.” At Special Hearts, students, who range in age from 12-80, take classes in a variety of the arts including dance, theater, music and art. The group performs around the city and has become a favorite of Corpus Christi mayor Paulette M. Guajardo, who invites them to participate in the Fourth of July celebration each year. On Saturday morning, about three dozen Special Hearts performed a sign language version of the song “Love Can Build A Bridge.” Students beamed as they did the number, which they’ve adopted as their theme song. Arts are the focus of the center, but perhaps more important is the confidence participation builds and the community that is forged through the classes. “We don’t say special needs in here,” Davis said. “We say Special Hearts. We never say disabilities. We always say special abilities.” Before each of their performances Davis leads the group in a back-and-forth affirmation. “I always ask them: ‘Who are you?’ And they say: ‘Special Hearts.’ And I say: ‘What do you have? Special abilities?’” Victoria Hinojosa has been a Special Heart for about three years and is the center of the group’s ballet folklorico performances, plays the guitar and takes art classes. When she first joined the group, she told Davis she couldn’t dance because she’s in a wheelchair. “I said: ‘don’t say, I can’t do, say do what you can, how you can,’” Davis said. “And boy, can she swing that skirt.” Hinojosa, who recently began volunteering to help others at the center, can’t overstate the importance of Special Hearts in her life. “I don’t know where I would have been if it wasn’t for Special Hearts,” she said. “It has really made me feel confident in what I do and how I look at things and I love the way I draw now, and it inspires me to do more.” Though he’s often almost 2,000 miles away in New York City, Trevino’s presence is a huge part of Special Hearts. A big photo of him hangs in Davis’ office and posters featuring pictures of him and the students adorn the center. Davis sends him videos of their performances and she recently sent a picture of the group holding a Yankees banner they made with his name on it. “It’s amazing what he’s doing for Special Hearts,” Hinojosa said. “He has really made us all happy, made us really look at ourselves and think we can do whatever we want. We can go out there and perform... and show people what we can do.” Though Davis and the students credit Trevino for his support, he’s quick to point out that the most special heart in the organization is the one belonging to his former teacher. “That’s what it is, it’s her heart,” Trevino said. “Her heart — it’s ginormous. She has a big heart and she’s always looking out for other people.” Idali Duarte Montes, another former student of Davis who now works with her at Special Hearts, agreed. “Without Sherri, of course, this wouldn’t even be here,” she said. “It came completely from her 100%. And all her hard work was what started it. And then everybody, all the love that she exudes and gets from others that want to support and help has brought all that to Special Hearts in the Arts.” Wiliam Rucizka, is another student who is known around Corpus Christi as “Will The Thrill” for his ability to hype up the crowds before performances. Constantly smiling and upbeat, Rucizka enjoys a variety of activities at the center. “We do art, music, theater, dance and ... we do ‘Love Can Build a Bridge’ every day,” he said. “We do celebrating every day.” And because of Trevino’s recent gift, Special Hearts will add a new program. Called “The Remarkables,” the group will dress as superheroes, each with their own special power, and perform at children’s hospitals and nursing homes. Though he’s been out of high school for more than a decade, Trevino still leans on things Davis taught him. An important one is a breathing technique that the Gold and Platinum Glove winner uses to slow things down and “really be in the moment” before games. “It’s really cool what Ms. Davis is doing, and I have a lot of respect for her, and I appreciate everything she’s doing,” Trevino said. “I think anybody who’s around Ms. Davis is lucky because she’s just a great person.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name (required) Your email (required) Report a typo or grammatical error (required) Submit Δ Suggest a Correction",

(AP) — An 81-year-old man who investigators say terrorized a Southern California neighborhood for years with a slingshot has been arrested, police said. While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40 km) east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group. He was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Advertisement",

Speaking after she inspected the worksites, Dr Noura Al-Mashaan, also Minister of Municipality, said 92.2 percent of the project has been executed, affirming that the venture is in line with the state’s approach to provide citizens with top-notch public services. “This is a bright stage in our efforts to attain the objective of providing an excellent infrastructure,” said Mashaan, referring to the Cairo Street project that covers the construction of three tunnels and six causeways. It also includes building seven pedestrian bridges, water and rain networks, phone communications, lighting, traffic signs and urban greenery. Mashaan, who also examined works for developing the Second and Third Ring Roads, said that up to 97 percent of the renovation works have been accomplished in these locations. She also praised efforts exerted by the personnel of the Public Authority for Roads and Transportation. Cairo Street links several residential districts and regions. Kuwait’s domestic transport network is distinguished, with up to seven ring roads accessible to all residential districts and workplaces. — KUNA",

        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "content": "It’s rarely ever easy when fans must say goodbye to a beloved sports icon, and today is such an occasion. We have confirmation that legendary NBA center Bill Walton has sadly died at the age of 71. Per the news, the beloved athlete passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer and was surrounded by family and friends at the time. Since the news of Walton’s death broke, numerous fans, sports pundits, current and former players alike have reached out and paid tribute to the hall of famer. And among them are the likes of Magic Johnson Julius “Dr. J” Erving. Magic Johnson, one of the NBA GOATS , is certainly someone who’s had a fair amount of encounters with Bill Walton during his lifetime. The revered athletes played each other more than a few times throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s. And, even after their NBA stints ended, the two remained good friends. Upon learning of his comrade’s passing, Johnson took to X to pay tribute: Rest in peace to a friend, 2X NBA Champion, Hall of Famer, and one of the most skilled centers we’ve ever seen Bill Walton! His NCAA Championship performance as a UCLA Bruin against Memphis is by far the most dominate NCAA Championship performance ever - he shot 21 for 22 and had...

He was ultimately drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. As a Blazer, he became an NBA champion in 1977, even earning Finals MVP honors. Additionally, he was named league MVP, made two All-Star teams and reached other benchmarks while in Portland. After leaving the team in 1979, Bill Walton would have a six-year stint with the San Diego Clippers and spend three seasons with the Boston Celtics, where he’d win his second championship. The center retired in 1988 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Since then, many continue to admire his heroics on the court, his work ethic and character. ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith, who’s known to reach out amid personal matters involving NBA players, shared his own tribute to Walton on X. Take a look: Incredibly sad to hear of the passing of my buddy, Bill Walton. His game was ahead of its time, truly one of the greatest big men who ever played. Yet, nothing compared to his passion and love of life, itself. I can hear him now imploring me to “smile......cherish... pic.twitter.com/IBI7Enjr5K May 27, 2024 The former Sixth Man of the Year receives a lot of respect from fellow centers, many of which he blazed a trail for (no pun intended). Fellow Celtic Kendrick Perkins – who works with Stephen A. Smith at ESPN – shared a message of admiration on X following the basketball legend’s death: Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Rest in Peace to the Legend Bill Walton!!! 🙏🏾 Bill Walton’s passing was confirmed by the National Basketball Association via a press release. It also included a statement from league commissioner Adam Silver, which was shared on Instagram . And he shared some respectful thoughts on the late Walton: Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. Of course, the player-turned-sports analyst ( who was hilarious on TV ) also garnered respect from athletes known for other sports. Former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman dropped a message of his own on X and added a sweet flourish to the message that alludes to the player’s past status as a Celtic: An absolute legend. RIP Bill Walton☘️ While it’s tough to have to bid farewell to such a beloved man of great character, it’s wonderful when people come together like this to pay tribute. It’s similar to how stars and fans memorialized the late Bill Russell after his passing, and paid tribute after Kobe Bryant's death . Bill Walton may be gone, but he surely won’t be forgotten. And we here at CinemaBlend extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends and loved ones at this time.",

        "content": "AMERICA'S Got Talent has added to an important aspect on the show. Host Terry Crews praised the change and said it was necessary as Season 19 begins. The new season of AGT kicks off on Tuesday, May 28. Terry, 55, sat down with Great Day Hollywood to talk about the judges , the contestants, and the changes they will have this season. After saying that the current judges are the \"dream team,\" he opened up about how the Golden Buzzers will be different this season. The judges - Howie Mandel , Heidi Klum , Sofia Vergara , and Simon Cowell - along with Terry all get a Golden Buzzer. This sends an act that they deem worthy enough to go straight to the live shows without having to go through the rest of the auditions. Typically, the judges and host each get one, and some seasons, they do a group Golden Buzzer. But, for Season 19, there will be nine total Golden Buzzers. The judges will each have two while Terry has one. Terry explained why they upped the number of them. \"What would happen would be the judges would see all this tremendous talent and they would end up apologizing,\" he said. \"They're like, 'Man, if I had another one, I would hit it.'\" \"We said, 'Give them another one!\" Terry shouted. \"And what we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there.\" \"It's so incredible. I think that the show needed more and now we finally got it and I think everyone is going to be happy,\" Terry ended. What we found is that there was not one Golden Buzzer wasted because there's so many deserving talents out there The host also teased that this season will have the youngest ever contestant at 2 years old. Fans can watch the new season on Tuesday on NBC at 8/7c and the next day on Peacock . This new twist was first announced in March. Simon, 64, opened up about the change when he and his fellow judges were filming the current season. \"In the first two days we’ve used more Golden Buzzers than we’ve ever used - that’s got to be a good sign!” he told People . Simon also serves as the executive producer on the show. Season 19 will feature \"some of the wildest acts to ever grace the AGT stage,\" according to their logline.",

        "content": "Judge Judy Sheindlin is outraged by how out-of-control crime has engulfed some major cities in the United States — but it isn’t a surprise to her, either. “We got here because a small group of people who have very loud voices created a scenario where bad people got rewarded,” Sheindlin told Fox News . “And the victim got punished by the system.” The “scenario” the TV judge is referring to involves actor Steve Buscemi, who was randomly attacked in Manhattan earlier this month by an alleged assailant who would later be identified as a 50-year-old homeless man. While Sheindlin admitted that there are situations why some criminals become criminals, she argued that it shouldn’t always justify their actions, Fox News reported. “There is always a reason for criminal behaviour — didn’t have a good upbringing, didn’t have two parents in the house, didn’t have one parent in the house, there’s always a reason.” She continued: “You’re mentally ill. That’s a reason. You took drugs. That’s a reason. You took alcohol, your brain is fried... Whatever it is.” But she insisted there is “never an excuse for bad behaviour.” Sheindlin added: “And when society started to make excuses for bad behaviour, and react to criminality based upon the excuses, it fell apart.” A post shared by Judy Justice (@judyjustice) She then used New York as an example, after the state raised the minimum age to 18 from 16 for defendants to be prosecuted as adults in criminal cases. The judge called the age change “ridiculous,” adding that if a 17-year-old kills someone, they should “never be allowed to walk the street again because society can’t take a chance.” Sheindlin was also critical of some district attorneys. “When you have district attorneys who are charged, whose job it is to do justice but to keep the community safe... When you have elected district attorneys who don’t know what their job is, they should go find another job,” she said. “Fill ice cream cones someplace. But don’t ruin cities,” she added. “What’s happened around New York City, Portland, San Francisco, you had district attorneys who didn’t know what their job was. And the cities are ruined, people are leaving.” Sheindlin added: “I think we better get smarter before we get lost. Permanently lost.” Sheindlin is currently in her third season of Judy Justice, following her 25-year Judge Judy run. She recalled an interview she did with Morley Safer on 60 Minutes in 1993 where he asked her what family court would be like in the future. “I said, ‘worse. A lot worse,’” she recounted. “And that’s what happened.” She added: “Here we are, 30 years later, and are we in worse shape as a country, as a world, than we were in 1993? You bet your bottom we are.”",

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "It's about time that we got new smartwatches from Samsung. The company has been working on a new lineup that we now know includes the and Watch 7 Ultra models. As it stands, the company is expected to unveil these devices at its Unpacked event on July 10, where it's also going to unveil the new foldable phones. The Galaxy Watch lineup has been due for a design upgrade. The recent models have largely looked the same. Admittedly, there's only so much you can do, design-wise, on a device that as small as a smartwatch. Samsung has made efforts over the years, fine-tuning and making adjustments while retaining the circular design that has made its smartwatches so popular. Smartwatches came in all shorts of shapes back when the Galaxy Watch was trying to establish a footing in the market. Samsung made the conscious decision of choosing a circular shape, one that made it look like a conventional watch the most. Even though regular watches are also available in a wide variety of unique styles, it's the circular that remains the most popular. Evidently, the idea from the get-go has been to provide customers with a familiar look and feel while offering them functionality that one simply doesn't get on a conventional watch. Since the Galaxy Watch series went circular in its design language there haven't been very many significant changes, but that's now set to change. The first show an entirely new design. It's a mix of squarish and circular, certainly unique as far as smartwatches are concerned, but horologically-inclined would be quick to see the similarities between this design and that of some conventional watches, particularly those from Swiss watchmaker Panerai. Panerai's smartwatches, particularly the Luminor series, is instantly recongizable because of its squarish and circular design. It's one of those few watch lineups that have retained their iconic design over decades. Others that come to mind include the Rolex Submariner, the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, and the Patek Philippe Nautilus. The Luminor watches from Panerai are well known for their cushion-like cases with a circular dial and a distinct bridge that protects the crown. If you look at these watches close enough, it's easy to see where some inspiration has been drawn from for the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra. Sure enough, Samsung's smartwatches haven't had a “crown” like the Apple Watch, but the addition of a new button in the center is just as close to putting a digital crown on the smartwatch as Samsung has come. It's not a bad thing that the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra seems to be inspired by an iconic watch lineup, on the contrary, I think that it'll make watch lovers like myself gain more interest in smartwatches. For far too long, device makers have approached smartwatch design the same way as they have for smartphones and other products. Watches are supposed to be far more evocative. They can be heirlooms passed in the family for generations, incredible works of mechanical engineering, pieces of jewelry decked out with the finest gems, and they can also be signs of success. Smartwatches may be able to do a lot more than a normal watch, but they've remained soulless products, devoid of the capability to foster any emotion or connection in users. They'll just get rid of the one they bought last year to get the latest one that's come out this year. You don't see many people doing that with an Audemars or a Patek. That's not to say that the changes Samsung has made to the design of puts it in the same league as those giants, but at least now it doesn't look like yet another cookie-cutter smartwatch. Ever since smartwatches took off it felt like regardless of the manufacturer, they were there to confine regular watches to the dustbin of history. There was a sense of arrogance about them, that since they could help keep the user connected 24/7, regular watches will have no place in the future. On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra's inspiration appears to have been drawn from a place of respect. It doesn't seek to destroy an established order, rather, it pays homage to the centuries-old tradition of watchmaking that have given us some truly amazing designs. I've said it before, the key to getting more regular watch users to buy a smartwatch is to make them look a lot more like conventional watches. Samsung has clearly seen that this approach works, its circular models have remained a customer favorite, so it's now kicking things up a notch and adopting a design language that's highly regarded among the watch lover community. It's as if the new smartwatch from Samsung is striking a balance between being unapologetically tech-forward with , larger display, and improved battery life, while being respectful of the conventional watch industry. I imagine that a lot more regular watch owners will look at the Galaxy Watch 7 Ultra and want to buy one, because it provides them with a chance to experience something new on something that doesn't look too foreign. I know I will, I've been literally craving this smartwatch ever since the leaked renders surfaced online. Will others feel the same way? Only time (pun intended) will tell.",

        "content": "Simon Cowell stopped tonight's live episode of Britain's Got Talent to issue a message to Ant McPartlin . As the first live show of the series kicked off tonight, hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly welcomed viewers to the live semi-finals and reminded viewers that they were live for the first time this series, as the auditions are pre-recorded. The pair went to chat to the judges, including Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli , but Simon stopped them for a moment to send a sweet message to Ant - who has just become a father for the first time. Ant and his wife Anne-Marie welcomed baby Wilder into the world only a few days ago, and he was quick to take to social media at the time to thank fans for their support and well-wishes over the happy news. Announcing the news, he wrote: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick Mcpartlin. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon.

In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair. And the former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott. Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one. 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote. 'I feel such a horrible mummy for not seeing them and guilty but I think it's important for them to have a nice time with their daddy. Helen Flanagan shared a candid post on Instagram on Sunday about the 'mum guilt' she feels over her youngest child Charlie as she opened up about life as a single mother The former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott 'I suppose mum guilt never goes no matter what you do x They went on holiday with their lovely nanna too which helps me as I get lots of pictures of them looking really happy x.' In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon. Her and Charlie shared a sweet moment as they cuddled on a picnic blanket and made funny faces together. Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time, it's a massive healer and I look back at myself this time last year and I can give myself kindness and compassion for maybe looking for love in the wrong places and numbing how I felt x. ' As mummys we just do our best at that time x. Maybe I've not always got it right but always had the right intentions x. I feel like I've changed so many times since Matilda was born and that we have grown together and our bond is really special x.' Helen opened up about going through her separation from Scott while Charlie was a baby, saying: ' Charlie was one when me and his dad split and I remember in the build up to us separating I was still breast feeding and I couldn't get my baby boy off the boob and it made me feel quite trapped and stuck as I couldn't do anything on my own independently as my baby needed to be stuck with me all the time and he would just cry for me and maybe because everything felt a lot emotionally when I finally got Charlie off the boob at 14months with help from a nanny.

'I do feel guilty for maybe not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls. I struggled to sit and just play with him.' She added: 'To be honest I struggled to be in the house too much as it all felt a bit sad. Their daddy moved away for football and originally he surprised me with our family home that me and the kids live in and I suppose at the beginning I just didn't want to take on the reality that it really was just me now and the three little ones. 'That was just a bit much for me. The beginning of the year was tricky and I felt so guilty for not being my best. 'I know I'll have such a beautiful relationship with Charlie and the girls. Feel in such a happier place this summer and I'm so grateful ✨.' The heartfelt post comes after she revealed the heartbreaking details of a psychotic breakdown she suffered earlier this year. Taking to Instagram in March, Helen revealed that across January and February she was fighting a secret battle with her mental health after her split from Scott Sinclair.

Opening up the The Mirror , she confessed she struggled to deal with the split: 'I don't see it as a break-up, I see it as a divorce. We were together 13 years. But instead of processing it all, I threw myself into work and shut off my emotions. 'I just went into survival mode. Then it all came to the surface earlier this year and I was mentally and physically breaking down.' She then started medicating for her ADHD and suffered a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time.' Whilst in the grasps of her episode, Helen jetted to Bali with her kids Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two, who she shares with ex Scott.

During the trip, she shared a slew of sweet snaps - with smiles hiding her hidden pain following the painful break-up from her ex and her new life as a single mum.

        "content": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain's Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn't played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu's result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal's Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China's Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches. Shapovalov will next play the winner of Monday's match between Mattia Bellucci and Frances Tiafoe. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city’s Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn’t immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn’t the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago’s Cook County in 2023 alone. Advertisement",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? MEXICO CITY (AP) — An American quarry company on Monday rejected the Mexican president’s campaign of criticisms and closures, as well as his offer to buy its property on the Caribbean coast. In July, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered to buy the American company’s Caribbean coast property for about $385 million amid a bitter, years-long dispute. Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion. The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say the project has damaged the caves, which hold some of the oldest human remains in North America. The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico. The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train. Advertisement Advertisement",

He noted that India has been taking lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help achieve goals. While addressing Committee A of the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Monday, Apurva Chandra said, “At this critical juncture, when all countries are working towards our collective Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring health services for all so that no one gets left behind, India has been taking the lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help us achieve our goals,” according to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare press release.

        "content": "Residents of central Mexico may have thought they were accompanying Dante through the I nferno in a freakishly wild weekend for weather. Extreme heat, destructively strong winds and a consequential hail storm — all accompanied by flooding — tormented central Mexico beginning on Friday. In a “be careful what you wish for” moment, residents of the city of Puebla, who may have been wishing for relief from the heat wave , were stunned by a wicked storm that pounded them with hail for 30 minutes on Friday afternoon. The squall covered streets in up to 50 cm of accumulated hail, nearly burying several cars in one neighborhood, toppling trees and producing flooding across the Historic Center and the northwestern part of the state capital. Winds of up to 50 km/hr collapsed the roof of an auto dealership and a department store, knocked trees onto a housing project, blew over billboards and caused a power outage. City and state civil protection agents were out in force to survey the damage and assist the public in digging out from the hail drifts. Police rescued a young girl who was being swept away by floodwaters, but no casualties were reported. ⛈️Intensa tormenta de granizo en #Puebla 🚨Con este video de @Manatimx , la tormenta de esta tarde en #Puebla corresponde a un #Downburst ✅Es una corriente que desciende desde la nube a gran velocidad, trayendo abundante granizo y viento que puede superar los 80 km/h pic.twitter.com/7OXlVXAdXz — 🌲⛈️Meteorología México🌧️🌳 (@InfoMeteoro) May 24, 2024 On Sunday, strong winds knocked over tarpaulins at campaign events in two municipalities of México state, causing dozens of injuries. Meanwhile in Mexico City, capitalinos sweltered in the extreme heat all weekend. Sunday was the third consecutive day in which a record was set. The mercury hit 33.8 degrees Celsius (93 ̊F), which is a new all-time record for May 26. A day earlier, the temperature topped out at 34.7C, surpassing the all-time record set on May 9. Friday’s high also climbed above 34C, setting a new record for May 24. National Meteorological Service (SMN) data confirms that record-setting temperatures are likely to continue through June, the newspaper Debate reported on Sunday. Mexico’s current heat wave — the third of an expected five heat waves this season — has seen temperatures above 45 C in parts of the country. The Monday morning forecast from SMN warned that 19 states will experience extremely hot temperatures this week. Intense storms and high winds remain in the forecast for northern Mexico, where gale-force winds destroyed a stage at a political rally on Wednesday, killing nine people and injuring dozens. The temperatures up north are expected to ease slightly in the coming days, according to the weather site Meteored, but tropical humidity will arrive in its place. The emerging weather system will bring heavy rains in parts of central and southern Mexico, and states in the west and northwest should be prepared for extremely high winds.

        "content": "GAZA: The Zionist entity faced a wave of international condemnation Monday over a strike that killed at least 45 people when it set off a fire that ripped through a tent city for displaced Palestinians set up by Kuwaiti charities. Kuwait’s ministry of foreign affairs condemned on Monday the Zionist occupation’s aggression against displaced people. In a statement, the foreign ministry asserted that Zionist occupation’s actions against Palestinians exposes its blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world. This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including International Court of Justice resolution on immediately ceasing aggression against Rafah and protecting the Palestinian people. The Zionist entity said it was looking into the “grave and awful” impact on civilians after the latest mass casualty event in the Gaza war. The Zionist military said Sunday evening’s attack in the southern Rafah area had targeted and killed two senior Hamas operatives - but it also sparked a fire that Palestinians and many Arab countries condemned as a massacre. A US National Security Council spokesperson said the Zionist entity “must take every precaution possible to protect civilians”. The UN Middle East envoy Tor Wennesland called on the Zionist entity to conduct a “thorough and transparent” investigation into the strike, as the Zionist military said it was launching a probe. UN human rights chief Volker Turk decried “horrific” images that “point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by (the Zionist entity) that have already led to so many civilian deaths”. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X that “these operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.” EU foreign ministers agreed to call a meeting with the Zionist entity to get it to explain its actions in its Rafah offensive despite a UN court order to halt it, said the bloc’s top diplomat Josep Borrell, who called the strike “horrifying”. Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the government was investigating the “tragic accident” which he told parliament occurred “despite our best efforts” to protect civilians. Zionist government spokesman Avi Hyman earlier said: “It was definitely grave. Any loss of life, civilian live, is grave and is awful. We seek to go after Hamas and limit civilian casualties.” Relatives of captives held in Gaza, who have increased pressure on Netanyahu’s government demanding action to secure a captive release deal, heckled the premier from the public gallery as he was speaking and raised posters of their loved ones. The Zionist entity launched the attack on Rafah on Sunday evening, hours after Hamas unleashed a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The Zionist army said its aircraft “struck a Hamas compound in Rafah” and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. Gaza’s civil defense agency said the strike ignited a fire that tore through a displacement center in northwestern Rafah near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. “We saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs ... We also saw cases of amputations, wounded children, women and the elderly,” said civil defense agency official Mohammad Al-Mughayyir. “The sky suddenly lit up,” said displaced Palestinian Muhannad, an eyewitness. One survivor, a woman who declined to be named, said: “We heard a loud sound and there was fire all around us. The children were screaming.” Footage from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society showed chaotic nighttime scenes of paramedics racing to the attack site and evacuating the wounded. Mughayyir said the rescue efforts were hampered by war damage and the impacts of the Zionist entity’s siege. “There is a fuel shortage ... there are roads that have been destroyed” as well as “a shortage of water to extinguish fires”, he said. “We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. “All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.” Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said the Zionist entity lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. “The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said. The Zionist attack sparked strong regional protests from mediators Egypt and Qatar as well as from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Egypt deplored the “targeting of defenseless civilians” and labelled it part of “a systematic policy aimed at widening the scope of death and destruction in the Gaza Strip to make it uninhabitable”. Jordan accused the Zionist entity of “ongoing war crimes”, Saudi Arabia condemned “the continued massacres”, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed “to hold these barbarians and murderers accountable”. Qatar condemned a “dangerous violation of international law” and voiced “concern that the bombing will complicate ongoing mediation efforts” towards a truce. The African Union chair Moussa Faki Mahamat also condemned the attack on X saying: “(The Zionist entity) continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an ICJ ruling two days ago ordering an end to its military action in Rafah.” The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered the Zionist entity to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about “the physical destruction” of the Palestinians. The Zionist offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly women and children. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on X that “with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible”. “The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,” he said, with “heavy movement restrictions”, ongoing Zionist strikes and Hamas rocket launches, and other “challenges ... that do not allow us to distribute aid”. On Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway are due to formally recognize a Palestinian state — a step so far taken by more than 140 UN members but few Western powers. The Zionist entity opposes the move and on Monday announced punitive steps against Madrid, ordering its consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering services to Palestinians from June 1. - Agencies",

        "description": "A victory for the Labour Party would give the opportunity to rebuild relations between Belfast and London after a difficult period",
        "content": "The UK general election scheduled for July 4th is a welcome opportunity to hit the reset button between political parties in Northern Ireland and Westminster. Since the Brexit vote on June 23rd, 2016, relations between the Conservative government and the North’s main parties have been strained, for a variety of reasons. The Tories played a cynical game with Northern Ireland during Brexit negotiations. Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, gave a pledge to unionists that he would never accept a border between Britain and Northern Ireland, before he signed a deal in October 2019 to put customs and regulatory checks down the Irish Sea. Overall, Brexit has been a source of significant instability, which is underlined by the fact that the Stormont government was shuttered for a total of five years on two separate occasions since the 2016 vote. READ MORE Temu: What is it, how do I pronounce it, and why is it so cheap? Ken Early: Manchester United face a choice over Erik ten Hag, but not a difficult one Coleen Nolan: ‘I haven’t had two failed marriages, I’ve had two amazing marriages, because they gave me amazing children’ Una Mullally: Jennifer Zamparelli would have been worth fighting for. But if The 2 Johnnies ‘were never ours’, why hire them? The Conservative Party has carried its lack of consideration for Northern Ireland onto the campaign trail. It has said that its idea of introducing mandatory national service for 18-year olds will include Northern Ireland. Suggesting that people from a nationalist background sign up for the British army shows an astonishing lack of sensitivity. According to all credible polls, the Labour Party will win a thumping majority on July 4th. Hilary Benn, who is the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has shown a willingness to engage with both communities, and the growing non-aligned middle ground. Labour would not reverse the Brexit vote, but it would take a much more constructive approach to relations with the EU. That would be a positive development for the outworking of the Windsor Framework, which gives Northern Ireland access to the UK internal market and the EU’s single market for goods. It is going to be a difficult election for the DUP amid the ongoing legal woes of Jeffrey Donaldson, the former party leade r, who is facing allegations of historical sex abuse. Underlining this, the news that Alliance party leader Naomi Long will contest the Belfast East constituency poses a significant challenge for Gavin Robinson, the interim leader of the DUP, to retain his seat. The splintered unionist vote means Sinn Féin appears poised to return the highest number of MPs in the July election. This would make Sinn Féin the biggest party at local council, in the Stormont Assembly and Westminster – a remarkable milestone. There are no indications that Sinn Féin will reverse its policy of abstentionism. Nevertheless, it would need to develop a good working relationship with Labour. The same applies to the DUP and the North’s other political parties. Political stasis in recent years has taken its toll on public services. The people of Northern Ireland deserve better. A Labour government presents the opportunity for a fresh start.",

Her mugshot for the May 20 DUI Shocking new video shows a police officer emptying bottle after bottle of Fireball whiskey out of Kathryn Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after officers seized it following her arrest for causing a three-vehicle-collision last week. In a cache of new footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, the former Southern Charm belle can also be seen flunking her field sobriety test earlier that evening – wobbling shoeless in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene. Dennis, 32, was arrested and charged with being drunk at the wheel and transporting alcohol in open containers when she smashed into the back of a car as it slowed to a stop at a red traffic signal about 9.15pm last Monday. That car in turn hit the car in front of it. Last week bodycam footage emerged of Dennis sobbing in the back of a police car as she was transported by officers of Goose Creek Police Department to Berkley County Detention Center in Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Now, DailyMail.com can reveal new details of that journey, of Dennis's erratic behavior and of the chaotic events that preceded it. The former Southern Charm belle can be seen flunking her field sobriety test - wobbling, shoeless, in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene New video shows a police officer emptying bottles of Fireball whiskey out of Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after her DUI arrest In the video, the officer takes the Fireball bottles out of the bag one by one, before coming across a single can of Coke. He eventually throws them all in the trash. According to the incident report obtained by DailyMail.com, the first officer to speak to Dennis observed her 'glossy eyes' and 'the odor of alcohol emanating from [her] person.' The officer also noted 'an unopened bottle of Fireball on the driver's side floorboard' and a 'pink tumbler cup in the center console which was empty'. The officer noted that Dennis refused a breathalyzer test but agreed to undergo a field sobriety test. Captured by the dashcam video of his patrol car the extent to which Dennis flunked the test is painfully evident. According to his report the first test the officer carried out was the 'Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test,' in which a person is asked to track an officer's finger while the cop looks for the tell-tale involuntary eye jerking which happens when someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol looks to the side. As well as smelling the alcohol on Dennis, the officer noted four out of six clues suggesting intoxication while conducting the test including a 'lack of smooth pursuit' on Dennis's part. The next test was a walk and turn for which she chose to remove her sandals. Here the officer noted she could not even keep her balance while standing in the starting position, used her arms and hands for balance as she walked and missed the heel to toe requirement of the walk on numerous occasions. She was also unable to balance on one leg without wind-milling her arms to keep her balance. Later, oblivious to her performance, Dennis can be heard telling herself: 'I passed that f***ing field sobriety test. This is some b******t. Like, I literally am not drunk.' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests Videos show the reality star handcuffed after failing sobriety tests. She tells the cops: Y'all are ruining my life' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests. When officers searched the pup's dog carrier they found, 'several mini bottles of Fireball, some of which were opened and empty.' Indeed, footage of the search of that bag as she was booked into Berkley County Detention Center some hours later shows an officer removing at least ten miniature bottles from the bag – some are empty, some are open and appear half empty, others are full and still bound together by the plastic wrap of the multipack in which they were bought. Read More EXCLUSIVE Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis's car is seen speeding through a school zone before hitting officer and knocking stop sign out of her hand in hit-and-run incident - months before DUI arrest Patrol car footage of the drive from the scene to the detention center reviewed by DailyMail.com shows Dennis running the emotional gamut in attempts to derail the due process of her arrest. At times she pleads, at others she wails in fury at being separated from her 'child' by which she means her dog. At some points she threatens the officers with legal action, saying she will 'ruin' them, at others she attempts to chat more calmly and elicit sympathy. When she sobs her tears appear to be out of frustration and anger that none of her tactics have any impact on the cops. She accuses the officer of touching her inappropriately as he reaches across her to fasten her safety-belt across her lap while her hands are cuffed behind her back. She then accuses the officer of trying to 'gaslight' her 'like my ex.' Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congressman Thomas Ravenel which resulted in two children and ended in 2018 when he was hit with sexual assault charges by three women , was the predominant plotline or her eight seasons with Bravo reality show, Southern Charm. The reality star was also booked for driving with an open container Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congress man Thomas Ravenel ended in 2018. They share son St. Julien Rembert, eight, and daughter Kensington Calhoun, 10 At one point during her transportation to the detention center Dennis pleads for leniency from the officer arresting her saying, 'I'm going to lose custody of my children, please!' But Dennis lost custody of Kensington 'Kensie' Calhoun, 9, and St. Julien 'Saint' Rembert, 7, to their father following a protracted and bitter custody battle as she repeatedly failed the court-mandated drug testing on which her rights to her children depended. She now has supervised visitation with them every other Saturday and Sunday. At another point she says, 'I'm never going to get my kids back. Thanks guys. There's literally no reason for me to be here. So congratulations it's f***ing b******t.' Vacillating wildly, Dennis seems lucid at times, before lurching into a rage and threatening the officers, 'I will f***ing ruin you,' when they explain her dog will be taken into a pound until someone can come and collect him. Later, in a moment of apparent resignation and exhaustion she says, 'There's no way to go back now is there?' Dennis was booked into Berkely Detention Center Monday night where she was held before being released on bond. Her bond was set at $1,199.50 for the DUI and $257.70 for transporting an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.

Chhim Phalvorun, a spokesman for the CPP, said yesterday that the party won the majority of votes in the elections. “Our party agents are collecting the data, and we are waiting for the official results issued by the NEC, and then we can analyse it,” Phalvorun said. The official results of the Council Election will be announced on June 8. Five political parties— the CPP, the Khmer Will Party, the Nation Power Party, Funcinpec and the Khmer National United Party, contested the non-universal suffrage elections. Kong Monika, Secretary-General of the Khmer Will Party, said that the party lost some votes for two reasons: firstly, it was slow to garner support from some commune councillors of the Candlelight Party and secondly, local authorities arrested commune councillors who were voters. The KWP replaced Candlelight Party which was disqualified to run the elections. Monika added that the results of the Capital, Provincial, City, and District Council elections on Sunday were not different from the Senate Election earlier this year. “Based on the votes in each constituency, the Khmer Will Party can get between 40 and 50 seats for the Capital and Provincial Councils, and more than 300 seats for the City, and District councils,” he said. The CPP obtained 9,376 council seats (1,648 commune chiefs, 1,618 first deputy and 261 second deputy positions) during the June 5, 2022 commune elections. Candlelight Party has 2,198 councillors (four commune chiefs, 25 first deputy and 1,360 second deputy posts), Funcinpec has 19 commune councillors and Khmer National United Party has 13. NECs Chairman Prach Chan said that 11,598 sitting commune chiefs and councilors, or 99.79% of the 11,622 eligible voters, cast their ballots for 4,200 capital, provincial, city and district councillors on Sunday. “The elections were conducted smoothly with good security and order, and without any violence or intimidation,” Chan said. He said that the council elections were held in a free and fair manner based on the principle of liberal multi-party democracy. CPP won all the votes in Pursat, Kep, Pailin and Mondulkiri provinces. In general, nationwide most of the votes went to the CPP, followed by KWP, and KPP. Based on the preliminary results in Phnom Penh, the CPP received 813 votes, the KWP received 80 and the National Power Party got one. In Battambang province, the CPP received 711 votes, the KWP garnered 100 votes and the KPP got 11. In Siem Reap, the CPP received 541 votes, KPP (90), the KWP (35) and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote. In Prey Veng province, the CPP received 737 votes, the KWP got 140, the KPP had six, while Funcinpec and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote each. The Capital, provincial, city and district council elections are held once every five years. Only commune councillors are eligible to vote. The third Council Election was held on May 26, 2019. Seven political parties had contested the elections.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Young star Varvara Gracheva pulled out of the early upsets of the French Open 2024 as she eliminated Maria Sakkari in the first round of the competition on May 27, Monday to move to the second round. Buoyed by the support from the home crowd, Gracheva secured a comeback win over the Greek star with the scoreline reading 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 as the match ended in just over 2 hours and 10 minutes. Sakkari, who was looking to make amends for her poor showing in the Australian Open, had a shaky start as Gracheva was able to break her in the very first game. However, Sakkari was able to return the favour in the next one as she was slowy able to gain control over things and took a 4-2 lead by breaking the 23-year-old French star. The duo would then go on lose while serving, before Sakkari finally pulled away and secured the first set 6-3. Gracheva would find her groove in the second set and was finally able to break Sakkari to take the lead and extend it to 4-1. Sakkari, however, would mount a comeback of her own and levelled the score at 4-4 as the odds were in favour of the 6th seed at that point. However, the French star was able to get a grip of proceedings and won the next two games to make the game 1-1 and pushing it into the decider. The third set saw both women push each other in the early goings with the score level at 2-2. Gracheva was able to take the lead from the serve and then both women had an incredible back and forth in the next game. It seemed like the Greek star would be able to level things up before Gracheva used the encouragement from the crowd to gain the advantage and secure the break point. The next serve saw Gracheva on the verge of securing the win with the score at 5-2, before Sakkari dug deep to save a couple of match points and get the game. However, it wasn't able to start a revival for the 6th seed as Gracheva secured a memorable win to progress to the next round.",

        "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago man convicted of murder based in part on testimony from a legally blind eyewitness is suing the city and the police department. A judge convicted Darien Harris in 2014 in connection with a fatal shooting at a South Side gas station in 2011. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was freed in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he went free. Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in April alleging police fabricated evidence and coerced witnesses into making false statements, the Chicago Tribune reported Monday. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back together. “I don’t have any financial help. I’m still (treated like) a felon, so I can’t get a good job. It’s hard for me to get into school,” he said. “I’ve been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.” A message The Associated Press left on the city's Law Department main line seeking comment Monday wasn't immediately returned. The department provides attorneys for the city, its departments and its employees. Harris was an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested. The legally blind eyewitness picked Harris out of a police lineup and identified him in court. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and saw a person aiming a handgun. He also added that the shooter bumped into him. Harris’ trial attorney asked the witness if his diabetes affected his vision. He said yes but denied he had vision problems. But the man’s doctor deemed him legally blind nine years before the incident, court records show. A gas station attendant also testified that Harris wasn't the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Chicago's Cook County in 2023 alone.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "A digital endoscope used in colonoscopy. (iStock / Getty Images) DEAR MAYO CLINIC : I just turned 45 and am dreading my first colonoscopy. Why do I need to be screened if I’m not having issues? Can you walk me through the process? ANSWER : Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you’ve never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of screening is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we’re able to identify polyps , which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we’ve missed that opportunity. There are a number of ways we can screen for colorectal cancer . In the U.S., we most often use a colonoscopy . A colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45. The colon preparation prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we’re able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed. It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping, abdominal bloating or discomfort. That’s to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience nausea. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks. After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you’ll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate. Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don’t do any sedation at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your health care team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterward, there’s a bit of a recovery period, and then you’re able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don’t want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours. We still don’t have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a healthy diet and exercise can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. — Derek Ebner, M.D ., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

        "content": "After Arturo was accused of lying to be a client on Catfish, his ex-girlfriend exposed the dangerous behavior he showed while they were dating. In , Arturo was praised for his love story with Laura, which ended with the . In a post from May 24, a fan found a video of Arturo’s ex Aly claiming that he and Laura lied to get on the show. Aly revealed that Arturo started messaging Laura while they were still dating and said they met in person at a concert. However, he told Nev and Kamie that he and Laura never met before on Catfish. In another post from May 25, Aly shared further details about her side of the story following the response she received from her TikTok video. “I’m Arturo’s ex. he’s a manipulative and dangerous person who does not deserve your praise and empathy. Laura says racial slurs and allows Arturo to say inappropriate things about children,” she wrote at the bottom for users who wanted a summary of her lengthy post. “Both lied to get on this show despite having met in 2021. Please be careful who you support and do not give them attention.” Aly exposed Arturo’s negative behavior during their relationship and accused him of being abusive and stalking her, stating he continued the behavior after she began seeing someone new. According to her, Arturo went as far as sending screenshots of Aly’s tweets and Instagram stories because she blocked him. He allegedly also called her boyfriend’s workplace to report him for selling prohibited substances on set, which wasn’t true. Because the MTV series on the show, fans might not be surprised to find out that Arturo isn’t the sweet guy he portrayed himself to be, especially if her allegations are proven true. Although he’s still in a relationship with Laura as of now, fans are worried that he will reveal the same behavior he showed with his ex, Aly. Related:",

        "content": "The Kano State High Court has ordered the police to evict the dethroned Emir of Kano Aminu Ado Bayero, from his palace. The court also ordered Mr Ado-Bayero and his four colleagues in Bichi, Rano, Gaya and Karaye Emirates to stop parading themselves as emirs. The court issued the interim injunction on Monday, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed by the Kano State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, the Speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, and the Kano State House of Assembly. Earlier on Thursday, the Federal High Court had restrained the state government from implementing its new emirate council law that reinstated Emir Lamido Sanusi and dissolved the five emirates created by the preceding administration of former Governor Abdullahi Ganduje in 2019. The state high court judge, Amina Aliyu, gave the latest order after hearing an exparte application by counsel to the applicant, Ibrahim Wangida. “That an order of interim injunction is hereby granted restraining the 1st 2nd, 3rd 4th & 5th Defendants either by themselves, servants, privies, and or any other persons or officers serving under them or acting in connection with any other person from parading themselves as Emirs of Kano, Bichi, Gaya, Rano and Karaye pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. “That an order is hereby granted to the extent that the Commissioner of Police Kano State should immediately take the palace of the Emir of Kano situated being and lying at State Road Kano and evict the 1 Defendant/Respondent from the said palace pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice dated 24 May, 2024.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans were left seriously distracted during the very first live semi-final show. Tonight Britain's Got Talent returned for the first live shows of the series as the first group of acts competed for a place in the final. Judges Amanda Holden , Simon Cowell , Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli were back, along with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. As always the judges put on a glamourous display and Amanda, 53, looked incredible in an off the shoulder red leather dress with a daring thigh-high split. The presenter went braless for the look, and viewers were distracted when Amanda spoke to new dad Ant and co-host Dec, both 48, at the start of the show. Taking to social media, one wrote: \"Bit nippy, Amanda?\" Another said: \"Amanda could cut glass tonight.\" And a third joked: \"Does Amanda own a bra?\" It comes after Amanda admitted she thought she'd be fired when daughter Hollie, 12, stormed the panel with 64-year-old Simon's son Eric, 10, to send Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through with the Golden Buzzer. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" The moment came after Haribow received a standing ovation from the audience and roaring pleas for them to get a golden buzzer, despite all the judges already using theirs. Until this game-changing moment, Ant and Dec, plus each of the judges were allowed only one per series. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight .",

        "content": "President William Ruto has ordered the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to convene a meeting with stakeholders and address concerns raised on the sale and use of muguka. It follows the ban of the stimulant, a variety of Miraa, by Kilifi and Mombasa counties. The President on Monday met with the leadership of Embu county led by Governor Cecil Mbarire, her deputy, senator, woman representative and members of national and county assembly from the county. During the meeting, Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi informed the Prsident that muguka is a scheduled crop in accordance with the Crops Act, 2013 and the Miraa Regulations 2013. He said the two pieces of legislation were passed by the National Assembly and the Senate with the concurrence of the Council of Governors. “With muguka having been recognised by national legislation, any other laws or orders that contradicts national legislation is null and void,” Ruto said. “To address concerns of all parties and stakeholders, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock is directed to convene a consultative forum to address concerns raised and agree on the implementation of the Miraa/Muguka Regulations 2023,” the President said in a dispatch from State House said. He noted that having been passed by Parliament, the regulations obligate the government to allocate funds for the farming, licensing, promotion, regulation, transportation, aggregation, selling, marketing and export of the crops. To this end, Ruto said the government will pump Sh500 million in the 2024-25 Financial Year for value addition of the scheduled crops as part of the scaling up of their aggregation, grading, pricing, packaging and value addition. On pricing, he said the Council of Governors has already nominated three members to the Miraa/Muguka Pricing Committee to regulate the prices in accordance with the Crops Act, 2023. But despite the move, the President said the government remains steadfast in its commitment in the fight against drugs, illicit brews and other illegal substances.",

        "description": "The calima, or haze in English, is a sandstorm that engulfs the Canary Islands in a dense cloud of hot, dusty wind blown in from the Sahara. Experts say it's becoming more intense",
        "content": "UK holidaymakers planning to jet off to the Canary Islands have been warned that a severe weather event, known as the \"calima\", is becoming more intense. Tenerife and Lanzarote are popular destinations for Brits looking to spend time in the sun - but tourists are now being urged to brace for this potentially disruptive and intensifying phenomenon. The calima, or haze, is a sandstorm that descends on the islands in a thick cloud of hot, dusty wind, carried over from the Sahara. Weather experts say these sandstorms are getting worse and are also less predictable. If your sunny getaway is interrupted by a calima, it is likely to be far worse than what was experienced in the past. UK holiday hotspot Menorca resort chains off pretty streets to keep out tourists In February 2020, a severe thunderstorm sparked travel disruption ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) Data shows a startling 483 episodes of calima since 1980 across the islands an average of 24 stormy days per year. Such storms usually last around 1.8 days each. Fortunately, for those with their sights set on a summer stay in the Canaries, the worst of the storms often occur earlier in the year, around January and February. So, those heading to popular tourist spots such as Tenerife, Gran Canaria or Lanzarote this summer are not expected to see the year's fiercest sandstorms, but officials in the Canary Islands have released four pre-alert statuses for calima for the year. In February 2020, an intense calima shut down all eight airports on the archipelago, leading to significant travel chaos and unexpected changes to holiday schedules. The Canary president said at the time: \"We are under the influence of four phenomena with the alert for strong winds, the calima, coastal phenomena and forest fires. All the mechanisms required by the protocol have been activated. We have had fires in Gran Canaria in two municipalities and in six municipalities in Tenerife. Passengers wait outside Tenerife South Reina Sofia Airport after flights were cancelled due to a sandstorm on February 23, 2020 ( Image: AFP via Getty Images) \"We have a direct thread with the two Presidents of the Cabildos and 90 members of the UME (Emergency Military Unit) and 100 Civil Guard agents in Gran Canaria, and another 100 and more than 50 of the UME in Tenerife are working. In addition, there are more than 90 troops prepared in Seville to move to the islands iof the situation worsens.\" During calima, temperatures usually increase significantly. When the calima is intense, experts say you should stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, hydrate with plenty of liquids and wear face coverings when heading out. This is because staying outside for a long period during the calima can affect your respiratory system, especially if you suffer from allergies. A new study published in the journal Heliyon found that while the frequency of calimas has decreased, their intensity has risen. The increasing intensity of calimas is linked to changing weather patterns and because of this, there are visibility issues and challenges for air travel in the Canary Islands.",

        "description": "The relevant question about Suaalii isn’t about whether he should contest the Origin opener but on which side of the field he will play.",
        "content": "Thank goodness NSW coach Michael Maguire picked Roosters centre Joseph Suaalii for the opening match of this year’s State of Origin series. If he’d heeded calls to overlook the 20-year-old for signing a $5 million deal with Rugby Australia from next season, it would have been another part of Origin that Queensland apparently do better than NSW. In 2010, Brisbane Broncos star Israel Folau signed with incoming AFL franchise GWS Giants. The AFL announced the deal on May 31, with a media conference involving Folau and the Giants’ inaugural coach, Kevin Sheedy, held the next day – six days after Folau had played in the first Origin played for Queensland. The argument for banning Suaalii from playing Origin goes that to let him play gives Rugby Australia free publicity. Folau’s decision to take the $6 million on offer to become the face of an ambitious new club in rugby league heartland in Sydney’s west, and then announce it in the middle of the game’s showpiece event, the jewel in the crown as it were, was a dagger through rugby league’s artery-clogged heart. Spotlight: Joseph Suaalii arrives at the NSW team hotel on Monday. Credit: Kate Geraghty The QRL vetoed Folau’s selection for the rest of the series before hastily backflipping after intense lobbying from coach Mal Meninga and senior players. Brent Tate’s broken jaw may have also helped their argument. So Folau played the entire series, which the Maroons won 3-0.

Suaalii, who is only in his fourth season in the NRL, has produced some incredible touches in attack this year. But he can make the odd mistake, whether it’s a dropped ball or conceding a penalty. His defence, though, has improved significantly. If Maguire does play him on the right edge, he’ll be playing inside fellow rookie and right-winger Zac Lomax, who looms as Maguire’s greatest leap of faith with this side. Lomax has been in career-best form for the Dragons this season. He has made 2014 metres (fifth in the NRL) from 237 runs (third). But no player in the league has made more errors. Lomax has made 25 so far. When he threw an errant flick pass coming off his own line in the Anzac Day match against the Roosters, which led to their second try in their 60-18 drubbing, some people within Lomax’s own club reckoned it was enough to end his Origin aspirations. Now, he could end up on a precarious-looking right edge with fellow rookie Suaalii. Maguire had options: he could have played Suaalii on the right wing and picked either the Bulldogs’ Matt Burton, the Sharks’ Jesse Ramien or the forgotten man in the NSW conversation, Penrith’s Izack Tago.

        "description": "The relevant question about Suaalii isn’t about whether he should contest the Origin opener but on which side of the field he will play.",
        "content": "Thank goodness NSW coach Michael Maguire picked Roosters centre Joseph Suaalii for the opening match of this year’s State of Origin series. If he’d heeded calls to overlook the 20-year-old for signing a $5 million deal with Rugby Australia from next season, it would have been another part of Origin that Queensland apparently do better than NSW. In 2010, Brisbane Broncos star Israel Folau signed with incoming AFL franchise GWS Giants. The AFL announced the deal on May 31, with a media conference involving Folau and the Giants’ inaugural coach, Kevin Sheedy, held the next day – six days after Folau had played in the first Origin played for Queensland. The argument for banning Suaalii from playing Origin goes that to let him play gives Rugby Australia free publicity. Folau’s decision to take the $6 million on offer to become the face of an ambitious new club in rugby league heartland in Sydney’s west, and then announce it in the middle of the game’s showpiece event, the jewel in the crown as it were, was a dagger through rugby league’s artery-clogged heart. Spotlight: Joseph Suaalii arrives at the NSW team hotel on Monday. Credit: Kate Geraghty The QRL vetoed Folau’s selection for the rest of the series before hastily backflipping after intense lobbying from coach Mal Meninga and senior players. Brent Tate’s broken jaw may have also helped their argument. So Folau played the entire series, which the Maroons won 3-0. The sporting landscape has changed significantly since then, mostly for rugby union, which is no longer the same cashed-up powerhouse that pinched NRL stars Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor and Lote Tuqiri in the early 2000s.

        "description": "Offenders older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful acts would be registered.",
        "content": "A bill that aims to make unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor a crime that requires sex offender registration is one step closer to becoming law after passing the Senate May 22 on a vote of 34-3. Legal distinctions between consensual and non-consensual sex with a minor in existing state law are the root of the issue the bill seeks to address. Senate Bill 1128, authored by Sen. Anthony Portantino, would require individuals older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful sex with a minor to be classified as what’s known as a tier one offender and have their name placed on the sex offender registry for 10 years. The author said the goal of his proposal will additionally fix a loophole in existing law where consensual sex with a minor, if convicted of such, requires sex offender registration, while non-consensual sex does not. “It is inexplicable that consensual sex with a minor can cause someone to be placed on the registry while unlawful sex does not... [and] this bill will change that,” Mr. Portantino told The Epoch Times. “If you are 10 years older and have illegal sex, you should be put on the registry.” The aim is to help protect children across the state from becoming a victim to sex trafficking and hold offenders accountable, he said. Human trafficking victims are predominantly young girls and women, about 99.4 percent of such cases, according to California Department of Justice data. Supporters of the bill pointed to statistics showing that sex trafficking accounts for 89 percent of all human trafficking cases in California, according to the Public Policy Institute of California—as a sign that more needs to be done to address the issue. “As a society, we must protect vulnerable youth and hold those who harm them accountable,” the California District Attorneys Association said in legislative analyses. “SB 1128 would ... strengthen our laws and hold accountable sex offenders who target minors.” Opponents said the measure is too broad and would cause some to be unfairly placed on the sex offender registry. “While current law recognizes that cases of unlawful sex with a minor vary widely in their circumstances and potential harm, and thus provides flexibility in charging, SB 1128 ignores those varying circumstances and applies the measure of sex offender registration to anyone convicted of this crime, regardless of circumstance, and regardless of whether the individual is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor,” the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice said in legislative analyses. The criminal justice group alleges that those between the ages of 18 and 26 would be most harmed by the bill. California’s penal code defines all offenders 26 and under as “youth” because, officials say, their brains are still developing. “The majority of people affected by SB 1128 would be youth, as they are the people most likely to enter into sexual relationships with minors,” the group said. “Those most likely to be prosecuted ... are young adults, under 26, who are youthful offenders, which California law recognizes are subject to many of the same developmental issues as those under 18.” The group also contends the sex offender registration list—with about 88,000 individuals currently registered statewide and expected to increase if the bill is approved—is ineffective because it marginalizes and isolates them from jobs and housing opportunities. “Sex offender registration, even for serious sexual offenders, has a problematic history and has not been shown to benefit either the offender or the community,” the group said. “Adding sex offender registration would add no benefit, cause great harm to youth, and be enormously expensive.” Critics also point to comments made by the California Sex Offender Management Board as evidence that youth are vulnerable to exercising poor judgment and making decisions related to sexual activity that could cause them to face harsh punishment and consequences if the bill became law. They also highlighted recidivism rates of only about 3 percent for young sexual offenders. “Common methods of supervision and treatment used with adult sexual offenders are, for the most part, inappropriate and potentially harmful with youth,” the state’s sex offender board said on its website. “The Board strongly recommends that youth who have offended sexually should have services specialized for their needs.” California was the first state in the nation to require sex offender registration—beginning in 1947—to deter registrants from reoffending, provide law enforcement with relevant information and investigative tools, and protect the public. Offenders on the registry are required to register annually within five days of their birthday, with photos, location, and offense data available to public view. Having cleared the Senate with bipartisan support—with three Democrats voting against the measure, including Senators Nancy Skinner, Scott Wiener, and Susan Talamante Eggman—the bill will next be heard by respective committees in the Assembly in the coming weeks.",

        "content": "Anthony Martial bade an emotional farewell to Manchester United after confirming his nine-year stay at Old Trafford was over. The 28-year-old France international joined the club in a £36million move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on his official Instagram account, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. “Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my nine years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. 2017 Europa League Winners – Manchester United — Manchester United (@ManUtdUpdates_) “Thank you again for everything and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "description": "Walton was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams.",
        "content": "By TIM REYNOLDS AP Basketball Writer Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Acadia Coombs, 11, holds one of her 30 chickens in their new home in North Harpswell. Acadia sells their output under the name Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs. Robin Casey photo Imagine you had 30 pet chickens. Could you tell them apart and call each by name? Acadia Coombs can. The pint-sized 11-year-old powerhouse sells organic eggs from her family’s backyard farm along Harpswell Neck Road. She’s been an excited egg entrepreneur since she was 6 years old, even though she doesn’t like to eat eggs. This spring, her father, Bob Coombs, owner of builder R.L. Coombs Inc., was constructing what passing motorists speculated was either a garage or a small house. Turns out it’s the Taj Mahal of chicken coops. Acadia’s pets now have a spacious 14-by-48-foot area enclosed by chicken wire with an attached modern “barn” that’s not like an old-fashioned red barn. This one, with its mono-slope roof, is adjacent to the entrance to Barnes Point Road, and Acadia can ride her bike from her home on nearby Walini Way to feed her fowl. Joining the chicken menagerie is Henry, a portly New Zealand rabbit who was raised with the chickens and snuggles with them at night. Three Rouen ducks are happy paddling in a pond with a fountain on the 1-acre roadside property. On Mother’s Day, the family added twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Ruby and Emerald. Acadia is named after Maine’s national park, of course, and like any diligent poultry farmer, she has compiled spreadsheets with information about her chickens, including breed, date of birth, name, and the color of its eggs (white, medium brown, dark brown or greenish-blue). On a recent spring day after the school bus had dropped her off by the chicken coop, Acadia easily rattled off the monikers of her 18 hens, one rooster and 11 chicks. The hens are Midnight, Chickadee, Chirper, Honey, Big Crown, Birdbrain, Buttercup, Hard Pecker, Pumpkin Pie-Peanut, Lilly, Lilac, Miracle, Spotted, Speckle, Wood Chip, Sweet-pea, Pom Pom and Flapper. The baby chicks are Ugg, Cocoa, Oatmeal, Raisin, Sheli, Turken, Willow, Rusty, Amanda, Emma and Poppy. Petey is the rooster, a “gentleman who’s a good guardian” of the hens, said Acadia’s mother, Lisa. Acadia, an only child who is entering the sixth grade at Harpswell Community School, crosses her arms, puts a finger studiously to her face, and recites the breeds of her chickens. There’s a buttercup, buff Orpingtons, naked neck or turkens, Jersey giants, Araucanas, Wyandottes, white leghorns and an ayam cemani. She can tell if they’re male or female by looking at the shape of their feathers as she gently spreads their wings. “Turkens are my favorite,” she said, cradling a tiny black turken she had fetched from its heated brooder box, its skinny bald neck looking like that of an ostrich. Another favorite pet is Wood Chip, an all-white rescue chicken that can’t walk, likely because of frostbite. Acadia babied the hen back to health. She plucks it from the coop and gently sets it down in the dirt. With its legs unable to bend, it sits on its hocks, flaps its wings to move, and glides to safety under Acadia’s legs. “She’s more of a human chicken,” Acadia said. Why chickens? “It’s kind of a funny story,” Acadia related, her eyes blue as the ocean and her long blonde pigtails swinging from side to side. She told her dad she wanted another animal. “He was like, ‘You can have another animal as long as you can get money out of it.’ I said, ‘A cow?’ Too big. ‘A horse?’ Nope. My dad suggested chickens so I could sell their eggs.” And so began Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs, selling for $6 a dozen. At first she sold them to friends and neighbors. Now, with the new barn, she can sell them to passersby. Her dad scrambled to finish building the chicken coop in May after the family returned from Costa Rica, where Acadia went to school for three months. Her mom, Lisa, grew up in a city but is no stranger to pitching in to help Acadia. “I’m definitely the backup. (Acadia) gives me jobs and I do them,” Lisa said. Lisa and Bob met when Lisa was his brother’s boxing coach in Portland. Tall and slim, Lisa is a five-time national boxing champion in the welterweight category and was captain of the U.S. women’s boxing team. Because of her efforts, women’s boxing became an Olympic sport in 2012. Acadia said she prefers basketball to boxing. As far as what she wants to do when she grows up, Acadia said, “It’s complicated. When I’m an adult, I want to live in a small house with one or two kids and a 60-acre farm.” That’s after she becomes a veterinarian. In the meantime, Acadia, a preteen who one minute seems like a little girl and the next like a seasoned and wise egg farmer, said she has started writing a book for first-time egg farmers. This summer she’ll also find time to play volleyball and swim. And her mini zoo will keep expanding. Her next pet? A barn cat. Connie Sage Conner is a former editor of The Virginian-Pilot.

        "content": "RICCI RIVERO – University of the Philippines (UP) Fighting Maroons star player Ricci Rivero uploaded photos from 26th birthday party. Ricci Paolo Uy Rivero is a Filipino professional basketball player and actor, known for his dynamic playing style and significant contributions to Philippine basketball. Born on May 25, 1998, in Ilagan, Isabela, Philippines, Ricci grew up in a family with a strong basketball background. He is the younger brother of Prince Rivero, also a notable basketball player. Ricci Rivero attended La Salle Green Hills for his high school education, where he honed his basketball skills and emerged as one of the top high school players in the country. His performances in various high school tournaments earned him a spot in the De La Salle University (DLSU) Green Archers’ roster. Rivero began his collegiate basketball career with the DLSU Green Archers in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). During his time with La Salle, he quickly became one of the league’s most exciting and promising players. He was known for his agility, scoring ability, and defensive prowess. In Season 80 of the UAAP, Rivero was named to the Mythical Five, underscoring his impact on the court. However, after two seasons with La Salle, Ricci Rivero made a high-profile move to the University of the Philippines (UP) Fighting Maroons. His transfer was met with much anticipation and excitement. Rivero continued to display his basketball talents at UP, further establishing his reputation as one of the top players in collegiate basketball. Ricci is not only celebrated for his on-court performances but also for his off-court persona. He has a significant following on social media, where he shares insights into his life, training, and various personal endeavors. He is now dating Los Baños, Laguna Councilor Leren Mae Bautista. In a previous article, the politician shared a glimpse from Ricci’s birthday party . In a post on her Instagram account last May 27, Ricci Rivero turned to social media to share glimpses of his special day with his followers. On his IG, the basketball player posted a series of photos from his lively birthday celebration. Among the attendees was his girlfriend, Leren Mae Bautista. In the caption of the post, he wrote: “LATE!!! Bday dump!”",

        "description": "Qld Labor has dished out a pre-election sugar hit by way of cheap fares, but a political expert and a former premier say it's still the end of the line.",
        "content": "A surprise move by the Labor state government of Queensland to offer 50-cent tickets for public transport will only win over urban commuters already committed to the Greens. That’s according to a political expert, who says the incumbent government is only delaying a likely election loss in October. Griffith University Associate Professor Paul Williams provided his insight to The Epoch Times after it was announced that from Aug. 5, all Translink public transport tickets would cost just 50 cents as part of a six-month trial. Translink is government-run and is the largest provider of train, bus, and ferry services in Brisbane. But Assoc. Prof. Williams said the problem with policy “sugar hits” was that they seldom worked in an election, and voters often had short memories. “The problem is also that only a minimal number of people use public transport,” he said. The people who were most likely to use it and swing their votes to Labor, he said, were Greens-partial city-slickers who—might—angle their vote the way of Premier Steven Miles. Mr. Miles started above water, and the electorate “gave him a chance,” he said. But Labor’s primary vote is almost certainly likely to sit around the 20 percent mark in Queensland, largely due to voter dissatisfaction in four key areas: cost of living, law and order (especially youth crime), housing, and health. “Nothing will stop [Opposition Leader David] Crisafulli becoming premier in October,” Mr. Williams said. Labor is likely to lose 20 to 25 seats to the LNP (Liberal National Party) and some to the Greens, and there’s nothing they can do about it, according to the academic. “It won’t be a wipe-out, but it'll be a comfortable victory,” he said. “Labor’s careering to certain defeat. “This [50 cent fares] was announced quite quickly and these sorts of sugar hits don’t last.” Voters would most likely like to have seen changes to interest rates, mortgage payments, and grocery bills, he says. “It’s a blatant vote-buying exercise,” he told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s an act of desperation by the premier.” Mr. Newman said it would also lead to a difficult decision for an incoming LNP government who would need to decide whether it could afford to maintain the initiative or not, likely to cost millions. But Mr. Newman, who served as premier from 2012-15, said the move could also be a good way to determine whether public transport ridership increases. “It’s going to be a very interesting experiment to see what happens to public transport patronage in Queensland,” he said, noting it could ease pressure on the roads. “For all intents and purposes, it’s making public transport almost free. I don’t believe it’s sustainable, suddenly, it’s a massive increased cost.” “I expect this will save Queenslanders thousands of dollars over six months, and encourage more people to catch our fast, frequent and 50 cent public transport,” he said in a statement. “Encouraging more Queenslanders to jump on a bus or train to get to work or school will help bust congestion. “Queenslanders are doing it tough, but they can trust that my government is here to help, and we’re doing what matters to Queensland.” The LNP opposition provided a statement to The Epoch Times, saying the party believed Labor had driven costs up and was desperately trying to hold on to voters. “The LNP supports more cost-of-living relief, Queenslanders are doing it tough under a Labor government that’s driven-up living costs,” a spokesperson said. “The LNP is committed to long-term underlying cost of living relief, but after nine years of Labor driving-up costs, Queenslanders see Labor will now do and say anything to cling to power, including announcing measures which expire just weeks after the election.” But Minister for Transport and Main Roads Bart Mellish assured the public the move was one that would help provide hip pocket relief. “The Miles Government is providing critical cost of living relief to Queenslanders,” he said in a statement. “This initiative will importantly mean money in the pockets of families across Queensland.” Queenslanders will head to the polls on October 24.",

(NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ADSK ) between June 1, 2023 and April 16, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important June 24, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. SO WHAT: If you purchased Autodesk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 24, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Autodesk, Inc. lacked adequate internal controls as a result of issues with its free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices; and (2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

In theory, a sexual violence case committed to the Supreme Court would almost immediately land in the new list and be managed by a judge rather than a registrar. Chief Justice Lucy McCallum. Picture by Karleen Minney The list is intended to help deal earlier with pre-trial issues and things like recording complainant evidence, or work out if legal problems can be dealt with later by a trial judge to help speed up a months-long process. The Chief Justice also said she wanted prosecutors to present an indictment with charges, and for an accused person to be arraigned, at the beginning of proceedings. \"This is going to be across the board for all matters. At the moment the accused aren't arraigned until just before their trial,\" she said. \"I want them to be arraigned earlier, so that they have that focus with their lawyers to think about do they want to plead guilty or not guilty. \"They always can choose not to but I think it's important to maintain the focus on the fact that you're facing these charges, and you need to work out what you're going to do with them.\" The Chief Justice is set to formally announce the list soon. Picture by Karleen Minney Cross-examination \"I fully accept that an accused person is entitled to have a barrister cross-examine the complainant and test their evidence,\" Chief Justice McCallum said. \"That's what a trial is. It's a trial of the evidence.\" But the judge said courts had a statutory duty to disallow cross-examination questions that were \"misleading, confusing, offensive, annoying, harassing, humiliating, or repetitive\". \"So why aren't we doing that? Because we're all scared of not giving an accused a fair trial,\" she said.

I think judges need to own that responsibility a bit more.\" Accused given 'significant leeway' Erin Priestly, head of practice at the Sexual Violence Legal Service, agreed there was an imbalance and legal protections in place for cross-examinations were not invoked as they should be. \"We have observed judges to give significant leeway to the accused party to undertake cross-examination rather than to step in to ensure these protections are enforced,\" she said. The ACT Supreme Court. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Ms Priestly said she continually observed rape myths invoked during proceedings. \"Perhaps most common is the myth that people will act in a particular way in the days, weeks, months and even years after being subjected to sexual violence,\" she said. \"This is particularly the case when the violence has occurred in the context of intimate partner relationships. A very common immediate response to being subjected to sexual violence is to do nothing.\" The lawyer said rape myths reflect social ideas about what is and isn't sexual violence in the broader community. \"This means it's also critical juries have access to appropriate expert evidence about trauma responses and sexual violence, where appropriate, to combat these pervasive myths,\" she said. The ACT Women's Legal Centre pilot program established last year aims to support complainants through the criminal justice system and \"rebalance the scales\". Ms Priestly said the service supported the introduction of a specialised sexual assault court list, and its goals of reducing delays and achieving earlier resolutions. \"A specialised list is just one step in building faith in the criminal justice system. It alone will not achieve this, however, and it is just one change amongst many that are needed,\" the lawyer said. \"Such a list will only be successful where everyone involved - the judicial officers, the prosecutors, and defence solicitors - have adequate training on trauma responses to sexual violence and consider the design of processes to ameliorate these.\" Support is available for those who may be distressed.

Neurodivergence includes autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or dyslexia. Dr Alison Lally, a pediatric specialist at Canberra Hospital, said turning any room into a less chaotic environment for young patients could make all the difference in their care. She has introduced a range of sensory tools like virtual reality goggles equipped with games, magic shows and puzzles along with noise-cancelling muffs, a tablet and a light projector. This could make drawing blood or checking vitals less of a challenge. Dr Alison Lally, right, introduces Annabell Fenton and her neurodivergent son Max, 12, to a virtual reality headset at Canberra Hospital. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Mum Annabell Fenton said her son Max was \"a frequent flyer\" in the emergency department. She explained the 12-year-old, like most kids with autism, had an ever-changing sensory profile. \"You might be able to cope with pressure on Tuesday, but the next day, because you've had a bad night's sleep or your clothes are too tight, you might not be able to cope with noise,\" she said. 'Life-changing' tools can help avoid trauma Ms Fenton said sensory tools available in hospitals was life-changing for neurodivergent children. She said the extra support could save the children \"a lot of trauma\" in the long run. \"[The system] is not built for an autistic person, it's built for a neurotypical person,\" she said. \"It means our kids will start their journey with the health sector knowing that it's okay to need and expect these things, to say, 'I need sensory support', or 'I'm going to struggle in this setting'.\" Dr Lally, who also has a son with autism, said neurodivergent needs can be hard to grasp for those who don't live with them everyday. Emergency physician James Falconer is part of Canberra Hospital's ED staff. Picture: Karleen Minney \"Having ADHD or being autistic doesn't mean they're bad child or you've been a bad parent. It means we are just making them live in a world that suits us and doesn't suit them. It's similar to going to a foreign country, you don't speak any language,\" Dr Lally said. She said she was advocating for health professionals to \"break the bias\" and educate themselves about how to care for these patients which includes communication style or something as simple as dimming the lights. Parents can request these tools at Canberra Hospital by telling staff what neurodivergence their child has in a form titled CHS Neurodiversity Care Plan. Dr Lally looked forward to the opening of the new critical services building at Canberra Hospital, which has a dedicated sensory room for those who need it.

Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options In its 2024-25 pre-budget submission, Professionals Australia found that the public sector risked being caught in the \"slow lane of a two-speed industry\". Reported pay rises were 2 per cent in the Australian Public Service compared with 5 to 7 percent in other tech roles, the union reported. Medium base rates of pay of between $71,000 to $152,000 were being offered in the APS compared with between $110,000 to $187,000, plus stock options worth about $100k, \"which is now typical in new tech companies\". One of the sticking points to tech recruitment in the APS was identified as the 11.2 per cent salary cap increase over three years, as set by the Australian Public Service Commission. The union also urged swift action and investment to address science, technology, engineering and mathematics skill shortages in public sector agencies by removing average staffing level caps in public service agencies. \"Unfortunately STEM skill shortages threaten to derail the delivery of major infrastructure projects, the transition to green energy and digital transformation,\" the report said. Professionals Australia's government director Kathleen Studdert said that for the APS to build its STEM capability it needed to become competitive in a market for technical and engineering talent. Professionals Australia's Kathleen Studdert says the APS needs to build its tech capability. Picture by Keegan Carroll \"There is a benefit to doing meaningful, impactful work in the public sector that can and will attract talented and ambitious people,\" she said. \"Setting up a technical and engineering remuneration framework is a crucial first step to this. \"In some cases the total remuneration gap is six figures between public and private sector employers. It doesn't necessarily need to be dollar for dollar, but it needs to be in the same ballpark.\" PA members work in both the private and public sectors and its ranks include engineers, scientists, pharmacists, IT professionals, translators and interpreters. In spruiking the May budget, Public Service Minister Katy Gallagher said the public sector had grown by 10,000 people in the past year. And that public sector growth will continue in the next financial year . Social Services will grow by 3472 roles in the next financial year - largely spread across Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency - while Treasury's growth is predominantly linked to a 1771 increase to staffing in the Tax Office. The PA submission identified two key safety agencies, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Australian Transport Safety Bureau, as experiencing significant technical staff shortages and budgetary constraints, \"undermining their capacity to maintain the integrity of Australia's transport safety regulatory regime\". For instance, more than eight months on from the horrific Gundaroo plane crash in which a pilot and three children were killed , the ATSB is yet to issue its final report and potentially explain why an emergency parachute in the Cirrus aircraft failed to deploy. \"Unfortunately, the ATSB's workforce has seen significant turnover over the last seven years, and rising demand in each of the sectors the bureau manages (rail, aviation and marine) coupled with budget shortfalls has meant the capacity of the bureau to undertake investigations has been reduced,\" it said. The PA submission also found women were still seriously underrepresented in tech fields, especially engineering and IT. \"In addition, workplace outcomes for women in STEM remained unequal. The STEM Equity Monitor revealed that in 2022 the gender pay gap in all STEM industries was 17 per cent,\" it reported.

Rachel Stephen-Smith encouraged First Nations Canberrans to consider standing for election to the body. \"I think the referendum on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a Voice to Parliament has raised the profile of our own elected body,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said. \"And I hope that will encourage more people to have their say to ensure that we're electing a strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, and also to participate in the review so that we can continue to strengthen that voice to the ACT government and Assembly.\" Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith. Picture by Karleen Minney Ms Stephen-Smith said the failed referendum for a national Voice to Parliament had raised the profile of the Elected Body. \"I think one of the many reasons that Canberra's were the only jurisdiction to vote yes in the referendum last year was because we had the experience of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to government, and we know that it's made a positive impact,\" she said. Nominations to run for the 2024 Elected Body election opened last week and will close at noon on Monday, June 3. Voting opens on July 6 and closes at 6pm on Saturday, July 13. Elections for the seven-member body are held every three years. Eighteen people nominated for the 2021 election, and 267 eligible people cast formal ballots in the election. Census data collected in 2021 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed there were more than 6000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Canberra who would have been eligible to vote. A report into the conduct of the election, released by Elections ACT in 2021, said: \"At the time of polling at the [Alexander Maconochie Centre] on Wednesday 7 July 2021, approximately 101 detainees identified as being an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander. Of the 101 potential electors, a total of 19 people cast a vote.\" The Auditor-General last year found the part-time Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body in the ACT, which attracts low voter turnout, risked being an ineffective support for Indigenous self-determination in the ACT. An independent review is considering the future of the Elected Body, with the government earlier this year committing to working with the ACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community on improvements. The ACT committed $1.19 million over three years to increase members' paid time and set up an independent secretariat. \"The more people who are going to come out and vote, the more people are going to have conversations about the elected body - and then that will encourage more people to get involved,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of Stranger Things , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not Sabrina Carpenter and it’s not the Beatles’ Black Album , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s Boyhood , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides Stranger Things , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City and Bradley Cooper’s Maestro – is gearing up for the release of Chaos Angel , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following Blush (2020) and Moss (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If Moss was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single Therese , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ Therese Dreaming , Chaos Angel , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single Missing Out , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see Missing Out as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any Before Sunrise enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with Variety , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ Bacchae in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also been romantically linked ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like me and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on Chaos Angel, a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song Dark , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that Chaos Angel , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making Wildcat , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s Inside Out 2 , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.” Maya Hawke’s Chaos Angel is out on May 31.

The theme for 2024 is \"Now More Than Ever\", to facilitate conversation about shared histories and cultures like Uncle Billy T from Yukembruk Dreaming Dance Academy. \"Our dance group is not just about local dance, it's about the community,\" he said. \"Also recognising who we are as First Nations people, learning the songs and the dances. A lot of people just watch, they don't know what the song is about or the dance is about.\" The Yukembruk dance group followed Uncle Billy's smoking ceremony to welcome the community onto Country. \"It's good to see the whole community here as well,\" he said. Stevie Greenaway is a member of the Yukembruk dance group, alongside her children. Leilani Greenaway, 14, Uncle Billy T, Stevie Greenaway and Janara Duffin, 13, from the Yukembruk (black crow) dreaming dance academy on Monday. Picture by Keegan Carroll She said that people who come to these events get a better understanding of what Indigenous communities are about. \"It means the Aboriginal people and our culture being accepted by the wider community, which obviously, it already should be.\" \"The Yukembruk dance group allows my children to practice their cultural skills when we're not living on country, which to me as an Aboriginal woman is just amazing.\" \"Unless we do that, we're never going to be acknowledged, our culture won't reach where it should reach.\" In the children's marquee, activities that displayed Indigenous culture included Aboriginal symbol tracing, Yulunga language development games and the Wiradjuri dance dice. Ms Greenaway said her kids might have friends who don't understand Indigenous culture, so raising them to tell their friends who they are, and where they come from, in the story behind our First Nations people was important. \"I hope to raise strong, black, proud children who will always stand up for their rights, their country and their culture. That's what I want as a mum.\" Families gathered around the main stage where entertainment like Wallabindi and Djaarmby Band shared stories and song. AJ and Debbie Wiltshire were among those in attendance reflecting on what Reconciliation Day means to them. \"I think it's important to spread the message of reconciliation and everyone needs to be a part of it,\" they said. \"The more we can be around and talk about Aboriginal issues and bring them to the public, I think, the more the better.\" Local Canberra residents, like Martin Lumb, who, despite not often going to events like these, showed up to be part of the conversation. \"It's important that despite the referendum, we need to keep having some presence,\" he said.

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "content": "The NBA conference finals are lacking drama, as both series appear headed for a sweep and a finals clash between the Celtics and Mavericks. Indiana goes into Game 4 on Monday night attempting to save their season as a 7.5-point home underdog. Oddsmakers at DraftKings , among others, are clearly expecting a sweep. Ahead of Game 1 , we noted that the Celtics do not turn the ball over nor do they get their shots blocked. Wise bettors have smashed that trend into oblivion. Those prop projections have all plummeted thanks to a 100 percent win rate on Myles Turner’s blocks, steals, and blocks + steals prop in each of the first three games. Bettors who have followed the trend are more than 10 units of profit on three games, but oddsmakers, as always, are adjusting. Turner’s prop projection is down to 1.5 steals + blocks ahead of Game 4, and there likely will be no Tyrese Haliburton going forward . (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) Many have joked about Andrew Nembhard’s sudden emergence as he’s thrown up shots and connected on many, especially during a 32-point outburst in Game 3 . He kept the Pacers on top for most of that game before the Celtics furiously rallied to win. If Nembhard can’t keep up that hot shooting, the Pacers are live to get smoked Monday at home. And that’s where we could see some mop-up duty from guys like Peyton Pritchard, Sam Hauser and Xavier Tillman Sr. Based on the oddsmaker’s opinion of this game, it should seem likely that the Celtics are able to sit their starters for large portions of Monday’s contest. Hauser played 22 minutes in the Game 2 blowout (1-for-5 from 3-point range). Target Hauser in Game 4; he’s taking a ton of shots and his poor shooting has been nothing short of shocking, considering the Pacers own the worst defense in the NBA playoffs. Hauser is 1-for-11 in this series, taking multiple 3-pointers in each game he has played. His projection is 3.5 points, according to FanDuel and BetMGM, but given the expected game script and freedom he’s being given to fire away whenever he has the ball, he’s a good bet. Hauser’s overs are all worth targeting. Here’s my plan of attack for Game 4. PICKS: Hauser over 3.5 points scored (-113, BetMGM ) | 2+ 3-pointers made (+175, FanDuel ) | 10+ points scored (+500, Bet365 )",

        "content": "Anti-Semitic attacks are continuing in the territory, as a Jewish community leader dismissed the Albanese government's consultation on new laws to ban hate speech as \"too little, too late\". Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options The Canberra Times has been sent a photo of graffiti in Civic calling on Jews to leave, as evidence anti-Semitic hate speech continues in the ACT. The graffiti, scrawled onto a wall in East Row earlier this month, comes after nearby Anita Gelato was targeted with anti-Israel stickers in November . Australian Jewish Association president Robert Gregory, who took the photo while visiting Canberra on May 12, said it was no consolation the federal Attorney-General was progressing hate speech laws, when anti-Semitism had been allowed to spread for the past seven months. \"The Albanese government should have taken action immediately following the protest outside the Opera House on 9 October when it was clear anti-Semitism was spreading,\" Mr Gregory said. \"They have allowed the situation to deteriorate.\" Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on a standalone hate speech bill while still seeking to include religious vilification prohibitions in the government's controversial Religious Discrimination Bill . Mr Dreyfus said the Albanese government \"is committed to promoting and supporting respect, acceptance and understanding across the Australian community\". \"We are committed to protecting the community from those who promote extremism, hatred or seek to incite violence,\" he said in a statement. Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on hate speech laws. Picture by Karleen Minney Mr Gregory said it was \"not necessarily clear that there needs to be new laws\" and that there needed to be \"enforcement of the existing laws\". He acknowledged disagreement over the precise words chanted at the pro-Palestine Opera House protest, but said \"either way, the conduct was unacceptable.\" The ACT already has a ban on religious vilification as part of its Discrimination Act. It is unclear how frequently it is being enforced. Federal Opposition frontbencher Dan Tehan said the Coalition would \"work with the government in a bipartisan way\" on laws to address religious vilification amid the \"growing anti-Semitism, which is occurring at the moment\". \"The government has been too late to this issue, far too late to this issue, and we need to take strong action,\" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on Monday condemned \"confronting\" levels of anti-Semitism in Australia after a Jewish school in Melbourne was vandalised with threatening graffiti. \"We need to be, as a country, mature enough to be able to have a debate about what's going on overseas, to allow people to have their completely legitimate right to express their views about what's happening overseas - but to do that in a way which does not challenge our own social cohesion,\" Mr Marles said. Mr Marles visited Mount Scopus College after the school's fence was found sprayed with the words \"Jew die\", words he said \"have no place in our society\". Speaking alongside Labor MP Josh Burns, a former student of the school, he said the number of incidents of extreme hate speech he had observed in recent months were higher \"than any that I've seen during my lifetime\". Mr Burns said it was \"just devastating to see the graffiti outside a place that was such a big part of my life\". \"We need ... to stand strong and to stand firm against anti-Semitism in all of its forms,\" he said. A spokesperson for ACT Policing said it had \"received a report of a Civic business having propaganda stickers relating to protests placed on them\" in November. \"ACT Policing continues to monitor this type of behaviour and will prosecute as required those who are responsible for acts of public nuisance, vandalism or criminal damage,\" the statement said. \"We support a tolerant and inclusive society and encourage anyone who is the victim of racial vilification to report this crime to police.\" Share Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Email Copy Dana Daniel Senior Political Reporter Dana Daniel is Senior Political Reporter for The Canberra Times.

        "description": "City councillor notes naloxone kits were installed in City of Richmond facilities 'swiftly.'",
        "content": "Dear Editor, Re: \" How do Richmond schools respond to drug overdoses and poisonings ?\" May 22, 2024 It appears that Richmond schools have not taken any proactive measures to address drug overdoses and poisonings at this point. The Board of Education and their administration seem to be stuck in a state of political and bureaucratic gridlock. After a heated debate among trustees in December 2023, a motion was passed to conduct a feasibility study on the naloxone issue. The latest update indicates that the study is expected to be completed by the end of the school year. In contrast, Richmond City Council swiftly passed a motion in November 2023 to install naloxone kits in all civic facilities, including the Richmond Olympic Oval. Within just 30 days the process started, and now over 40 locations in the city are equipped with naloxone, alongside automated external defibrillators. There is a growing consensus among public health experts and policymakers that having naloxone available in high schools can be life-saving in the event of an opioid overdose. Given the infiltration of “street fentanyl” into the illicit drug market and the prevalence of drug experimentation among young people in high schools, it is imperative to have naloxone readily accessible to respond effectively to emergencies. Naloxone, also known as the “Lazarus Drug,” has been proven to rapidly reverse opioid overdoses by blocking the effects of opioids like fentanyl. Its effectiveness lies in its ability to work only when opioids are present in the system. It’s crucial for decision-makers to consult with local health authorities, school administrators and other stakeholders to establish protocols for the proper use of naloxone in high schools. In my years of researching drug policy, I have not encountered any experts who oppose the expansion of naloxone availability. While I cannot predict when, or if, the Board of Education will take action, I emphasize the moral imperative of prioritizing the preservation of lives. I urge the trustees to unite and fulfill their duty as guardians of our youth to prevent unnecessary tragedies.

        "description": "Out-of-date thinking on heavy industries needs to change.",
        "content": "The regions are key to Australia's enormous emissions reduction potential. They also stand to gain from its equally enormous clean energy and industry opportunities. Login or signup to continue reading Australia and its regions have incredible advantages: abundant renewable resources, a strong industrial history, a skilled workforce and established trading partners, ready and waiting for our green products. Despite these advantages, the country's heavy industries have been defined by many as \"hard to abate\" - in other words, it is considered difficult to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But that thinking is out of date: it is rather that they are \"late to abate\". Climateworks co-convened the four-year Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative which found it is possible to eliminate over 90 per cent of emissions in Australia's major heavy industry supply chains of iron and steel, aluminium, liquified natural gas, chemicals and mining of other metals such as copper and lithium. The other good news is Australia's heavy industries and associated emissions are clustered in a handful of places across the country. Five industrial regions - Illawarra, Hunter, Kwinana, Gladstone and the Pilbara - account for one-eighth of Australia's total emissions. That's equivalent to the emissions of every car and light commercial vehicle across the country. That is why taking a place-based \"Net Zero Industrial Precinct\" approach makes so much sense for Australia, alongside other national and state policies. The idea is relatively simple - focus on where the emissions and industries are and supercharge them with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen and shared infrastructure and take advantage of their existing skilled workforce. A place-based approach also allows for the costs, risks and benefits to be shared, and actions to be coordinated. Net Zero Industrial Precincts are a major revitalisation opportunity for our industrial heartlands to ensure they - and the communities they support - remain competitive in a decarbonised world. It wasn't that long ago that solar panels were considered a novel, emerging technology. I can remember in 2010 when Climateworks Centre showcased different low carbon solutions for Australia and solar ranked behind energy efficiency, transport and carbon farming. Today, close to 3 million Australian homes have rooftop solar, supplying over 10 per cent of the country's power. We have the highest amount of solar PV per person in the world and a renewable energy target of 82 per cent by 2030 for the national electricity grid. Earlier this month the federal budget showcased Future Made in Australia, a framework focused on developing wind and solar in addition to clean industries like green hydrogen and critical minerals. Australia is starting to focus on decarbonising not just the grid we have today but the economy we want tomorrow - one with prosperous clean industries that generations of Australians can work in and benefit from. Australia's national net zero legislation is now two years old, and older for all the state and territory governments and many companies and financial institutions. New national laws will require large companies' financial reports to include their emissions; those of their suppliers and customers; their forward targets to reduce emissions and their transition plan to get them there. Having agreed to net zero targets, now every country, sector and company needs a plan to achieve it. That's where the Australian government's sector decarbonisation plans come into play. The government is developing national net zero sector plans for the major parts of our economy that matter for emissions reduction: Electricity and energy, Industry, Resources, Transport, Built environment and Agriculture and land. There are a few key things that need to be taken into account when developing and implementing these plans. To solve for what the science demands, they should align ambition with the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming limit in the Paris Agreement. There are also many interdependencies between sectors. Most obvious is the energy and electricity sector, which must move quickly to build the renewable energy needed to power the decarbonisation of other sectors, including the built environment, industry and transport. Management textbooks say when you set your strategy you make a plan and provide targets and resources to those responsible for implementing it. We are now in the era where net zero strategy, targets and plans are being tackled by nations, sectors and companies. It won't be long until we can reflect on a time when industrial decarbonisation felt out of reach, and point to Australia's world-leading Net Zero Industrial Precincts and sectors with green supply chains producing and exporting green energy, green metals and critical minerals around the world.",

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Loading Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. Loading She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "description": "Leeds United’s latest play-off final heartache will hurt more than ever before. That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three...The post Neil Warnock states what he noticed about Daniel Farke when Dan James hit the crossbar for Leeds appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three decades and they have all ended in defeat. Some would say that’s typical because they have a serious mental blockage when it comes to these games, as they proved during their on Sunday. When hit the crossbar, it sent a shudder down the spine of both sets of supporters because the game was coming to an end and it was a moment that could have changed everything. The Yorkshire outfit, after falling behind to an early Adam Armstrong goal, just couldn’t play their natural game and Russell Martin was tactically outdoing , again! Southampton were the only team during the regular season to do the double over Leeds – and that showed at the home of football. Neil Warnock made it clear that ‘the best team won tactically’ even if he thinks highly about the man in the Elland Road dugout. , Warnock shared that he instantly looked down at the Leeds manager and noticed that ‘he knew’ that was it and the game was gone, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:55 pm). Very little time was left and if the Whites had any luck, then that effort would have hit the back of the net, but in the end, it’s another season in the Championship for Leeds. Leeds United lose play-off final to Southampton “When James hit the crossbar, I looked down at Daniel (Farke) and I think he knew,” said Warnock. “When that hit the crossbar, I think he knew that it wasn’t going to be. He shouldn’t batter himself because he has done a brilliant job. He is a lovely man and I think he is a good manager. “But I thought the best team won tactically. Look at that here, that’s a volley, no chance for the goalkeeper and any other way, it goes in. That’s in, it’s then a different game and they are on top. That’s football and you need a bit of luck, a referee decision or the smallest of things.” Big pressure on Daniel Farke You can’t see the manager leaving, whether that’s moving on himself or getting booted out. But this defeat does put huge pressure on him heading into the forthcoming campaign because nothing but promotion is expected. Two of the relegated sides – Leicester City and Southampton – did their jobs, so Leeds can’t have any excuses, in that regard. The issue for the club is that if you offered them a play-off finish next season, then fans wouldn’t probably accept it because they know what’s coming. But now it’s about dealing with the present, , they better hope that he is the only one.",

        "description": "Stress is normal. But how do we manage it?",
        "content": "Do you ever feel like the world is against you? or signup to continue reading Like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong? Like Murphy (and his law) has moved in and is squatting in your basement? Sometimes, it can feel like the world is against you when one thing after another comes at you like rolling punches on a speed bag ... and you're the speed bag. That's certainly how I've been feeling lately. Battered, bruised, barely able to catch my breath, and still having to show up for everything, plastering a smile on my face and making the best of it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Why do we do this? Why do force ourselves to pretend everything is OK, that we're coping just fine, that we don't need help? Is it shame? Embarrassment? The belief that acknowledging the challenges we are facing makes them real? Maybe it's a little of all of those things. Well, - once again sharing my own rawness and failures for the world to see - because I think it's really important that we remind ourselves that everyone needs help sometimes. And that's OK. Last week, my husband was rushed to hospital and spent the week in intensive care. We nearly lost him and it was stressful beyond measure. In between trying to get to and from the hospital, managing my and our son's respiratory infections, working, a uni assignment that was due, we had a house inspection we weren't able to reschedule. Then, this morning, I receive a phone call from my husband to tell me that we've received a \"no cause\" termination notice, so on top of everything else, we now have to try and find another place to live in a rental market that thinks it's OK to of all places. I mean seriously. Get a grip. At this point, what started out as a snowball rolling down the hill, has gathered so much stress and anxiety, panic and fear along the way as it rolls, it's become something of an avalanche. I'm finding myself desperately running in front of it as it careens down the hillside, trying not to be smothered by the immeasurable amount of stress-snow nipping at my heels as I find myself running more and more out of control, picking up pace I can't handle. Like I said, it's exhausting. I know I'm not the only person in this situation. in December 2022 and discovered that 64 per cent of people rated their stress level as 5/10 or higher, with 40 per cent of all Australians worryingly rating their stress level as 7/10 or higher. I really don't think we can lay claim to being the laid-back she'll-be-right-mate nation of the world anymore, and we need to seriously look at how this is impacting people across Australia. Stress is a natural part of our lives as it's a normal human reaction that everyone experiences from time to time. According to Dr Timothy Legg, It is a biological response to a perceived threat manifested through the physical and mental experience of the hormone release that produces the \"fight-or-flight\" response. However, stress becomes a problem when you start to feel overwhelmed by it or it lasts for a long time. So how can we manage it? How can I prevent the snowball turning into an avalanche and squishing me flat on the downhill spiral that appears to be becoming my life? Well, that's a very good question. Looking at the cause of our stress is an important factor in being able to manage our stress levels as this holds the key to finding ways to prevent stress occurring in the first place. However, stress prevention isn't always possible. The American Institute of Stress said (in not so many words) that essentially it comes down to the Serenity Prayer: it's about recognising there's no point stressing about things you can't do anything about, working out what you can do about the things you can change, and taking the time to work out what goes on what list. Now, I just need to find the magic solution to fear and panic and I'll be golden. I'm thinking something with four bedrooms and two bathrooms might have something to do with it.

        "description": "Out-of-date thinking on heavy industries needs to change.",
        "content": "The regions are key to Australia's enormous emissions reduction potential. They also stand to gain from its equally enormous clean energy and industry opportunities. or signup to continue reading Australia and its regions have incredible advantages: abundant renewable resources, a strong industrial history, a skilled workforce and established trading partners, ready and waiting for our green products. Despite these advantages, the country's heavy industries have been defined by many as \"hard to abate\" - in other words, it is considered difficult to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But that thinking is out of date: it is rather that they are \"late to abate\". Climateworks co-convened the four-year Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative which found it is possible to eliminate over 90 per cent of emissions in Australia's major heavy industry supply chains of iron and steel, aluminium, liquified natural gas, chemicals and mining of other metals such as copper and lithium. The other good news is Australia's heavy industries and associated emissions are clustered in a handful of places across the country. Five industrial regions - Illawarra, Hunter, Kwinana, Gladstone and the Pilbara - account for one-eighth of Australia's total emissions. That's equivalent to the emissions of every car and light commercial vehicle across the country. That is why taking a place-based \"Net Zero Industrial Precinct\" approach makes so much sense for Australia, alongside other national and state policies. The idea is relatively simple - focus on where the emissions and industries are and supercharge them with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen and shared infrastructure and take advantage of their existing skilled workforce. A place-based approach also allows for the costs, risks and benefits to be shared, and actions to be coordinated. Net Zero Industrial Precincts are a major revitalisation opportunity for our industrial heartlands to ensure they - and the communities they support - remain competitive in a decarbonised world. It wasn't that long ago that solar panels were considered a novel, emerging technology. I can remember in 2010 when Climateworks Centre showcased different low carbon solutions for Australia and solar ranked behind energy efficiency, transport and carbon farming. Today, close to 3 million Australian homes have rooftop solar, supplying over 10 per cent of the country's power. We have the highest amount of solar PV per person in the world and a renewable energy target of 82 per cent by 2030 for the national electricity grid. Earlier this month the federal budget showcased Future Made in Australia, a framework focused on developing wind and solar in addition to clean industries like green hydrogen and critical minerals. Australia is starting to focus on decarbonising not just the grid we have today but the economy we want tomorrow - one with prosperous clean industries that generations of Australians can work in and benefit from. Australia's national net zero legislation is now two years old, and older for all the state and territory governments and many companies and financial institutions. New national laws will require large companies' financial reports to include their emissions; those of their suppliers and customers; their forward targets to reduce emissions and their transition plan to get them there. Having agreed to net zero targets, now every country, sector and company needs a plan to achieve it. That's where the Australian government's sector decarbonisation plans come into play. The government is developing national net zero sector plans for the major parts of our economy that matter for emissions reduction: Electricity and energy, Industry, Resources, Transport, Built environment and Agriculture and land. There are a few key things that need to be taken into account when developing and implementing these plans. To solve for what the science demands, they should align ambition with the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming limit in the Paris Agreement. There are also many interdependencies between sectors. Most obvious is the energy and electricity sector, which must move quickly to build the renewable energy needed to power the decarbonisation of other sectors, including the built environment, industry and transport. Management textbooks say when you set your strategy you make a plan and provide targets and resources to those responsible for implementing it. We are now in the era where net zero strategy, targets and plans are being tackled by nations, sectors and companies. It won't be long until we can reflect on a time when industrial decarbonisation felt out of reach, and point to Australia's world-leading Net Zero Industrial Precincts and sectors with green supply chains producing and exporting green energy, green metals and critical minerals around the world.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not and it’s not the Beatles’ , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s and Bradley Cooper’s – is gearing up for the release of , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following (2020) and (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ , , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.”",

        "description": "A historic marker by an Allentown church was removed while the new owner was closing on it. He wants it back.",
        "content": "The new owners of a former Allentown church were at the closing while a historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it back. The marker was erected in 1932 on the grounds of the ivy-covered Church of the Ascension, located at 16 Linwood Ave., at North Street, by the Buffalo chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, also known as DAR. On May 10, Peter Johnson, DAR's handyman, removed the patinaed marker and the wooden post it was attached to. That happened as the 1872 Gothic Revival-style church's new owner, John Daly, was in a downtown office closing on the Medina sandstone property purchased with his sister Melissa Littlefield for $450,000. A June 21, 2016 photo shows a historic marker on Church of the Ascension property in Allentown that was there for 92 years until its removal May 10 by the Buffalo branch of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The new owner, who closed on the property the next day, wants it returned. Daly learned this because Johnson posted photographs of the removal on the Buffalo Rehab and Reuse Facebook page, writing, \"I've been tasked to remove it by 3 p.m. today,\" a half-hour after the scheduled start of the closing. The posts drew Daly's ire, leading him to file a police report charging DAR with whisking away something that wasn't theirs to take. \"I'm very disturbed that someone on social media bragged about how they stole it, and that they had a certain window of time to steal it,\" said Daly, a managing partner at the engineering and architectural firm Trautman Associates. \"It is bothersome that that person has not been apprehended and the property recovered. It was a downright, sneaky theft.\" Betsy Boundy, who initiated the marker's removal as a board member of the Katherine Pratt Horton Buffalo chapter of DAR, said it belongs to the organization and that the Episcopalian Diocese, which was selling the church, gave permission to take it. The nonprofit, which owns the historic Henry Birge House, also known as the DAR House, a Georgian Revival row house at 477 Delaware Ave., wants to relocate the marker to tiny Tony Sisti Park across from the church. \"Our Daughters of the American Revolution commissioned the marker. That's our marker and we are taking repossession of it,\" Boundy said of the group that claims descendants from supporters of the American Revolution in the late 18th century. But Jennifer Hurley, an attorney representing Daly's lender, said a search of the property's title report found no deed restriction or sale exclusion on file with the property showing DAR owned the marker, giving the group no legal right to it. \"There was nothing in the contract excluding the monument from the sale, and nothing in the title report indicating that there was an exception wherein the Daughters of the American Revolution could retrieve the marker if the church sold to another buyer,\" Hurley said. The sign in the middle of the controversy reads \"GUIDE BOARD ROAD\" on the first line, followed by, \"Directing Pioneers Coming from The East to Black Rock Ferry. Erected by Buffalo Chapter National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, 1932.\" \"If you look at the marker, it says 'erected by DAR' and not 'property of DAR,'\" Daly said. \"It never belonged to them. There is not a shred of evidence that it is DAR property.\" Gwen Howard, chair of the Buffalo Preservation Board, said neither DAR nor anyone else can remove a historic marker without going through proper channels. \"The marker is part of a historic site, and the site cannot be modified without the approval of the Preservation Board,\" Howard said. Daly expects to seek state and federal historic tax credits when the church is redeveloped, and the marker helps make the case for the property's historic value. While a mixed-use development in the former church is a possibility, \"we are in the planning stages, with nothing ruled in or out. We are intending on doing a historic preservation, and the history of the corner is very important to us.\" The former Church of the Ascension, at 16 Linwood Ave., was recently purchased by John Daly and Melissa Littlefield. A historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it returned. If Daly values the historic importance of the sign and wants to keep it on his property, why did DAR feel a need to remove it? Boundy said the DAR learned about the building's sale by accident, when they called the diocese about cleaning the marker. Boundy sought the marker's removal out of concern that the church, which closed in 2015, would be converted into residential housing and the grass where the marker was would become a parking lot. \"There is no parking on North,\" she said. \"If you are building housing units on that complex, then where are people going to park?\" Boundy never spoke with Daly about his intentions before removing the marker. \"The diocese would not tell us who the buyer was,\" she said. Louise Kreiner, DAR's house chair who asked Johnson to remove the marker at Boundy's behest, heard the marker wasn't wanted. \"I think it was going to be tossed by the new owners,\" she said. Johnson said on the Facebook thread that \"the lawn that that marker was on is going to become a parking lot and the church is going to turn into apartments.\" A responder thanked Johnson for \"preserving the marker that the new owner doesn't care about.\" Johnson didn't return phone messages left by The News. In a separate matter, he has been accused by Hurley of fraudulent billing practices in a lawsuit in State Supreme Court. Johnson's counterclaim on defamation was dismissed, with a second claim regarding a bonus still pending, according to court documents. Boundy contacted Fillmore Council Member Mitch Nowakowski, whose district includes Allentown, to see if she could get his help to move the marker to the nearby park. Nowakowski told The News that Boundy told him \"the new developers basically told them to get rid of it.\" All of this has Daly furious. \"They never reached out to me, and I'm very reachable,\" he said. \"It's also very disturbing when you hear accusations about what we plan to do. There won't be parking where that sign is. There is no way you can even put parking there.\" Although Daly never gave the diocese permission for DAR to remove the marker, it turns out his attorney did – but under false pretenses, she said. \"I have not heard anything about the sign,\" Kristina Ramos, Daly's attorney, emailed Donna Hartnett, the diocese's attorney, on May 9, after a second inquiry, on the day before the closing. \"You can have owner remove it.\" Ramos said Hartnett told her the sign was owned by DAR and she had no reason to question it. That was before, she said, she learned the sign was part of the property purchased by Daly. \"The church's attorney misrepresented who owned the sign, most likely as a result of assertions of third parties,\" Ramos said. \"But in the end, the sign belongs to Mr. Daly.\" Ramos said she plans to reach out to Hartnett. \"In the end, we would like the sign placed back because it's going to be maintained as part of the historic value of the building,\" she said. John Ramos, Kristina's husband and partner in the firm Ramos & Ramos, thinks the situation can be resolved in a way that puts DAR's fears to rest. \"Hopefully, this turns out to be a comedy of misunderstandings, and gets worked out amicably in the end,\" he said. Diocese spokeswoman Rebecca Wilson said the diocese went by what DAR presented to the attorney. \"I think everyone with the diocese was acting with the best of intentions,\" Wilson said. Nowakowski said he's ready and willing to help facilitate a resolution, but the whole episode has left a sour taste with Daly, who is inclined to let law enforcement handle it. \"I have heard so many lies from such a simple story, and I believe (my attorney) was deceived,\" Daly said. \"This could have been handled in a very cordial, friendly manner. It's very sad.\" Mark Sommer covers culture, preservation, the waterfront, transportation, nonprofits and more. He's a former arts editor at The News. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

        "content": "Do you ever feel like the world is against you? Login or signup to continue reading Like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong? Like Murphy (and his law) has moved in and is squatting in your basement? Sometimes, it can feel like the world is against you when one thing after another comes at you like rolling punches on a speed bag ... and you're the speed bag. That's certainly how I've been feeling lately. Battered, bruised, barely able to catch my breath, and still having to show up for everything, plastering a smile on my face and making the best of it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Why do we do this? Why do force ourselves to pretend everything is OK, that we're coping just fine, that we don't need help? Is it shame? Embarrassment? The belief that acknowledging the challenges we are facing makes them real? Maybe it's a little of all of those things. Well, I'm writing this column - once again sharing my own rawness and failures for the world to see - because I think it's really important that we remind ourselves that everyone needs help sometimes. And that's OK. Last week, my husband was rushed to hospital and spent the week in intensive care. We nearly lost him and it was stressful beyond measure. In between trying to get to and from the hospital, managing my and our son's respiratory infections, working, a uni assignment that was due, we had a house inspection we weren't able to reschedule. Then, this morning, I receive a phone call from my husband to tell me that we've received a \"no cause\" termination notice, so on top of everything else, we now have to try and find another place to live in a rental market that thinks it's OK to charge $630/week for a townhouse without ducted air conditioning in Wodonga of all places. I mean seriously. Get a grip. At this point, what started out as a snowball rolling down the hill, has gathered so much stress and anxiety, panic and fear along the way as it rolls, it's become something of an avalanche. I'm finding myself desperately running in front of it as it careens down the hillside, trying not to be smothered by the immeasurable amount of stress-snow nipping at my heels as I find myself running more and more out of control, picking up pace I can't handle. Like I said, it's exhausting. I know I'm not the only person in this situation. Australian Community Survey (ACS) by NCLS Research asked Australians about their stress levels in December 2022 and discovered that 64 per cent of people rated their stress level as 5/10 or higher, with 40 per cent of all Australians worryingly rating their stress level as 7/10 or higher. I really don't think we can lay claim to being the laid-back she'll-be-right-mate nation of the world anymore, and we need to seriously look at how this is impacting people across Australia. Stress is a natural part of our lives as it's a normal human reaction that everyone experiences from time to time. According to Dr Timothy Legg, It is a biological response to a perceived threat manifested through the physical and mental experience of the hormone release that produces the \"fight-or-flight\" response. However, stress becomes a problem when you start to feel overwhelmed by it or it lasts for a long time. So how can we manage it? How can I prevent the snowball turning into an avalanche and squishing me flat on the downhill spiral that appears to be becoming my life? Well, that's a very good question. READ MORE: Looking at the cause of our stress is an important factor in being able to manage our stress levels as this holds the key to finding ways to prevent stress occurring in the first place. However, stress prevention isn't always possible. The American Institute of Stress said (in not so many words) that essentially it comes down to the Serenity Prayer: it's about recognising there's no point stressing about things you can't do anything about, working out what you can do about the things you can change, and taking the time to work out what goes on what list. Now, I just need to find the magic solution to fear and panic and I'll be golden. I'm thinking something with four bedrooms and two bathrooms might have something to do with it.

And, when Body Sculpture arrived at its new home at the National Gallery of Australia, which had acquired it for a cool $6.6 million, unpacking the work wasn't quite the main event it usually is when new works arrive. While most major art galleries tend to be quiet places, there's often a buzz behind the scenes that most people will never see. From carpenters to robotic and IT specialists, there are people doing jobs you don't automatically associate with what you're seeing in the official gallery spaces. National Gallery of Australia operations and maintenance technician Neve Foxcroft, and chief information officer Jade Carson with Jordan Wolfson's Body Sculpture. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong And a growing number of them are women, especially when it comes to robotics and animatronics. For Body Sculpture , an entirely separate team was required to bring it to life once it arrived. The team was led by Sally Brand, senior project manager for complex artistic commissions - a realm of art that's developing at a rapid pace as the parameters around artistic definitions shift and morph. Body Sculpture features two robots - a factory-style mechanical arm, and a metal box with humanoid arms and hands, held captive by a chain. It's a disconcerting work that comes with a content warning and appears to lose control - a kind of statement on the darkness within the human condition. Paradoxically, putting it together involved plenty of planning, control and human intervention - of the tech-savvy variety. American artist Jordan Wolfson with his robotic work Body Sculpture, unveiled at the National Gallery of Australia in December 2023. Picture by Karleen Minney Brand, who has a background in both science and art history, says the art world is appealing to more than just artists and curators. \"Artists and scientists are particularly curious people in the world,\" she said. \"You have to be curious to work in the arts, and you have to be curious to work in STEM. \"But I do love that idea of STEAM, which is the STEM with art ... because you just have to be creative. It's all complex problem-solving.\" She had previously worked with Patricia Piccinini after the gallery acquired her renowned Skywhale hot air balloon, and commissioned a companion piece, Skywhalepapa . Like Wolfson, Piccinini requires large, multi-skilled teams to realise her vision. \"We took a lot of the learnings of when it's an artwork as well a lot of other things into this work on the robot, because it is a work of art,\" Brand said. \"People are running to meet with the technology and regulation that sits around robotics, but also wanting to encourage a lot of creativity in that place as well. It's really fascinating.\" The gallery's chief information officer Jade Carson, who works with the gallery's behind-the-scenes technology infrastructure, said the field for women who want to work in tech was ever-widening. \"People often underestimate the diversity of roles available in technology,\" she said. \"Wolfson's work and the women at the NGA who have helped bring it to life, shows how technology roles have evolved. \"We want people to see that you can align your passion and creativity with your work and that digital works of art are increasing.\" She's leading a Women in ICT panel discussion at the gallery on May 30 celebrating the intersection of art and technology, centring around Wolfson's Body Sculpture , and the various skills that are required to bring a work like this to life. \"If you're a woman in tech, or a girl coming through school, and you want to get into tech, or you want to do art, you can do both,\" she says.

        "description": "Annette King, Yukon's child and youth advocate, is calling for better legal representation for young people involved in court matters. She's also wants her office to be able to review any child deaths that happen in the territory.",
        "content": "Annette King admits that even after nine years as Yukon's child and youth advocate, she still finds many people don't quite understand what she does. \"I think everywhere we go and every time we meet with a different group, or even an individual client or family that comes to our office, we have to explain our role,\" she said. \"And I do think over the last several years, people are getting a broader understanding of what we do, as there's more experiences with our office, more reports that we've released publicly.\" The advocate office was created by territorial legislation passed in 2009. Written into the Child and Youth Advocate Act was a requirement for the all-party Members' Services Board to establish a process to review the act, within five years. Fifteen years later, that review is underway. King spoke to CBC's Yukon Morning host Elyn Jones about the review, and some of the recommendations she's making to update the legislation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Who have you heard from so far, in this review? We've been talking about this review in my whole term, which is now nine years. So we provide a little bit of input on what we've heard to date, each year in our annual report. And so at the beginning, what we've really focused on was our experiences to date, so what we were hearing from the people accessing our services and the service providers that we'd be working with. And we'd be like, \"OK, so if the act was amended, we'd want to really look at this or look at this.\" And then we worked really closely with youth advisors. So we contracted youth advisory groups. We've had a few different iterations of youth leading the way to review our legislation. They created a youth-friendly version of the legislation so that it made a little bit more sense. We connected really closely with the territorial youth collective as the territorial youth strategy was being developed. Then also we've stayed connected to service providers and First Nation governments throughout the years. Over the last year, I've been really targeting those conversations because I want to make sure that the First Nations governance, as it is intended to be, you know, in parallel to the Yukon government, that that is definitely represented in our legislation. And those conversations have been really deep and meaningful. One of the things that you're asking for is a mechanism to review deaths of children. Why is that so important? When this act came into place in 2009, it was a small little act. And I think that's partly why the review in five years was built into it, it was like, \"let's just start here, let's really get things so that young people have a voice in government services, and then we'll look at building it from there.\" Every other child advocate in the country — and there are 12 — have a child death review mandate. And so it's one of those questions that we've been asking over all of the years to anybody that we talked to about the legislation: how do you see that working? And we've had some great conversations with the coroner and with the death review investigators across the country. We've really looked at what could be a model for the Yukon. And so that's kind of what we're trying to develop. You're also calling for legal representation for children and youth, and better information-sharing. Tell us more about that. So when a child needs legal representation, it's usually three different ways. A youth over 12 that's been charged with a crime would need a lawyer for the criminal investigation. That is already in place really well, through legal aid — every young person who's been accused of a crime has access to legal representation there. In family law, there's two areas that we want to make sure young people of all ages have legal representation to make sure their views and rights are upheld in court. And that is, if there's a court matter regarding the Child and Family Services Act — so their placement, or if their custody is being changed as a result of being in that system — we want to make sure young people are represented in that system. Our office can represent young people in the decision-making and in the case planning. But when it goes to court, we don't have a role. And we want to make sure that that happens. And the other one is, we get so many calls regarding child custody matters and high-conflict custody matters where a parent will say, \"my child needs a view in this process. How do I make sure that happens?\" Our office isn't... we don't have child lawyers that go to court. We actually have a clause in our legislation now that says we can't interfere and impede with the court process. So we're trying to create that access for young people to have legal representation in those big matters where the adults have the, you know, the applicant, the respondent, the court decisions — but the child's voice matters in these things that impact their lives. When will you be presenting your recommendations? That's really up to the Legislative Assembly. I report to an all-party committee, so all three parties are represented on that. They've asked me to provide a submission to them of what we're recommending. I provide recommendations to them every year, but this one will be more fulsome. And we're hoping that we do some more targeted interviews over the summer and get that to them as soon as possible. Yukon ombudsman says territory's Safer Schools Action Plan doesn't go far enough 'Time for some action': Review to look at systemic racism in Yukon education I think we're at a point now where we've had so many conversations — and since I'm talking publicly, I want to thank everybody who's contributed. We've had even a sort of outline of what we're looking at on our website for the last several months. We just want to make sure we're getting it right, or that we're not missing other things. So we're continuing these conversations. Over the last year, I've been doing most of them myself. Like, I just wanna hear it myself 'cause I've been so in this act — like I'm in it, right? And I know what's going on. I've heard all the different stories and I'm putting them all together. And it's been a fascinating process. And I really hope that we'll be able to just advocate even more effectively for children in the Yukon. Can people still have their say? Absolutely. Yeah, this is not even close to done. On our website, we've got it right on the home page . And also on our website there's an e-mail address that people can just click. We have Facebook, Instagram. Or they can just call our office and set up a time to chat. I'm not huge into the surveys because like you said, what is this act? And unless you're in it, you don't really understand what the questions are. So what we've done is we've identified six areas of conversation, so six themes, and we've put like, one-pages on what our experiences are in that, and there's some key questions. So if somebody's really into writing a survey-type of answer to that, we are thrilled to have that. We've already had a few. I find those are good guides to creating the conversation. So, look at the themes and then call me and let's sit down and talk about it, if you have lots to say about it.",

        "description": "Budget for unforeseen events such as flooding has been increased to boost response.",
        "content": "Nairobi County government has shelved a few programs to enhance the implementation of key programs in the latest supplementary budget. The county executive reduced or completely scrapped funding for some projects in the 2023/2024 financial year Supplementary Budget to enable implementation of priority projects. Some of the projects the county government has prioritised include the school feeding program, bursary and scholarships, construction of stadiums and construction of markets among others. The Governor Johnson Sakaja-led adminstration has also rationalised the budget in line with its own source revenue collection trends ensuring that only projects that can be funded are retained in conformity with fiscal responsibility principles. Sakaja has said his administration is well prepared to tackle unforeseen events such as flooding by increasing its emergency response budget. \"In the remaining period of the FY, the County will accelerate the enforcement efforts to ensure all outstanding charges are paid and more revenues flow in to fund the above projects,\" Sakaja said. \"The County Treasury has made steady progress in the revenue mobilization efforts in the current financial year and the revenue mobilization strategies are showing positive results, the County is poised to record the highest own source revenues collected since the onset of devolution.\" By May 23, 2024, the County revenue performance was at Sh11.2 billion, one of the best performances since the inception of devolution. Among the vote heads affected by the county executive's move to scrap the budget is the county public service board whose original development budget was Sh 10,000,000. The amount was reduced to zero. Nairobi Revenue Authority's development budget of Sh100 million has also been scrapped completely. \"These allocations have been carried forward to the next financial year with the purchase of revenue mobilization vehicles under the Authority allocated Sh100 million,\" Sakaja said. The county executive reduced the Public Service Management budget to Sh10 million from the Sh30, million allocated. As a result, the Sakaja adminstration has provided an additional Sh30 million to the department in the budget for the coming financial year. The budget for the county assembly has been cut by Sh915 million to Sh300,000. The initial budget was Sh1.215 billion. The county government now says it has cut the budget for the County Assembly as a result of an agreement with the Sakaja administration to provide land for the construction of the administration block. The cost of acquisition of land and other attendant costs were hence knocked off the budget. County executive however increased the budget for Environment, Water, Energy & Natural Resources by Sh311,420,000 to Sh 732,460,000. The increase is to tackle the flooding by investing in more garbage collection, clearing of drainages, provision of more water tanks as well as improvement of the dumpsite. Ward development funds (WDP) were reduced to Sh 1.3 billion from Sh1.955 billion. This represents a drop of Sh655 million. With the total completion certificates raised for WDP at the time of considering the supplementary estimates standing at Sh600 million, the county deemed the Sh1.3 billion for the Ward Development Programme sufficient to take care of the completed works by the end of the financial year. This is by also considering that an additional Sh600 million is expected by the end of the financial year. With a focus now on key projects, the Sakaja administration now aims to ensure the key projects are implemented for the benefit of City residents.",

        "content": "Hackers are taking advantage of the Windows launch of Arc browser to trick victims into downloading malware . Arc is a relatively new internet browser , first launched for macOS in the summer of 2023 - and initial feedback from both media and the users was positive enough to prompt the release of a Windows version too. However, at the same time, unidentified hackers were creating websites with typosquatted domains, seemingly identical to the browser’s actual website. They were also creating ads on Google which, due to certain problems the network has, displayed the legitimate website, but redirected people to the typosquatted one. This meant customers who wanted to install Arc on their Windows device, and had used Google to search for it, would find an ad in the very top of Google’s search results page. The ad seemingly pointed to the site’s actual website, but led the victims to a malicious site which offered an infected version of the browser’s installer, hosted on MEGA, for download. Anyone who downloaded this installer would get the browser, but also malware which, according to initial reports, seems to be an infostealer, although confirmation on the malware’s nature is still pending. Hackers are always taking advantage of major events and product launches to try and trick people into giving away sensitive data, or downloading malware. Events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, Chat-GPT launch, Windows 11 launch, and others, have all been abused in the past to deliver bad code to people. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The best way to protect against these attacks is to always type the website address into the browser, instead of “just googling” it. If you don’t know the site, be mindful of the search engine results, and always double-check the characters in the address bar before downloading anything. Via BleepingComputer",

        "description": "Pinole resident Jeanne Gibson, 98, helped make history during World War II as a \"Rosie the Riveter.\" On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, she'll be one of about 70 heroes of that conflict honored in France.",
        "content": "PINOLE — Feeling she wasn’t giving enough to the war effort after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Jeanne Gibson — at the time only 18 years old — traded her nursing school life in Minnesota for a welding job in the shipyards of Seattle. Now 98, Pinole resident Gibson will be one of about 70 American World War II heroes honored in France on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, eventually leading to the liberation of France and the end of the war. “During World War II, everyone was on the same page. We were working to get it over with so we could get our boys back home,” Gibson said in an interview. “Everybody was just doing what they could. It was great and we were all working together. It was a good time as well as being a bad time because of the war.” The millions of women like Gibson who worked in American shipyards and factories during World War II — many of them stepping into the industrial workforce for the first time while the men who had formerly worked such jobs were deployed overseas — became known as “Rosie the Riveters,” after the song of the same name. The 1942 hit, popularized by several artists, could have been about Gibson herself: “All the day long, whether rain or shine / She’s a part of the assembly line / She’s making history, working for victory / Rosie, the riveter.” Whether or not there was a “real” Rosie on which the song was based is much-debated, but the most iconic image of Rosie the Riveter became the wartime poster by Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller of a woman with the sleeve of her industrial blue uniform rolled up, flexing her bicep as she proclaims, “We can do it!” Beginning May 31, Gibson and other honorees will be flown out to the headquarters of American Airlines in Fort Worth, Texas, where they’ll receive a send-off parade before boarding a charter flight to Paris. The trip will culminate in a ceremony on June 6 at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, where more than 9,000 American WWII soldiers are buried. The trip is made possible through a partnership between American Airlines and the nonprofit Old Glory Honor Flight. Gibson, one of only two Rosie the Riveters participating in the event, and a recent recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor, said she’s excited for the adventure. It’s far from the first in her lifetime though; besides her World War II welding work, she’s also earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, as well as a pilot license, and traveled abroad over the decades since. Before moving to Seattle, Washington, to weld warships, Gibson was studying to become a nurse in Minneapolis, having heard the position was in demand during the war. She remembers listening to the radio when news broke about the attack on Pearl Harbor and wanting to be of service. But after two quarters studying nursing, she said she realized the role wasn’t for her. She and a school friend, Esther Harri, landed roles as welders at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, working the cold evening shift in their safety helmets, leather overalls, jeans and long underwear purchased with their first checks. Gibson later took on another role making manifests and hatch lists for the Army Transportation Corps’ Embarkation Center in Juneau. Whether welding or filling out ledgers, Gibson said she loved and took great pride in the work. “Without World War II and what happened, I would be an entirely different person,” Gibson said. “It gave me courage to go ahead and I can do it. And it gave me some backbone.” After the war, Gibson moved to San Francisco and then Berkeley. She went on to earn a bachelor’s in psychology, and a master’s and Ph.D. in educational psychology from UC Berkeley, where she also taught multiple sections of educational psychology 101. While writing her dissertation, she also taught science to local schoolchildren and would end up dedicating 30 years of her life to teaching kindergarten through sixth grade. She and Harri earned their pilot licenses and joined a local chapter of the Ninety-Nines, a group for women pilots started by famed flyer Amelia Earhart and 98 others. They traveled the world, socialized with an assortment of friends, and picked up hobbies like weaving and baking. After attending a trip to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December of 2023, Gibson was inspired to begin telling her story to hundreds of visitors nearly every Friday at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park in Richmond, which honors the contributions of women during World War II. The work is what’s keeping her going, Gibson said, noting she especially enjoys encouraging young girls to fight for what they deserve, including fair pay. “I say don’t limit yourself to what you think you can do,” Gibson said. “You can do it and don’t let them pay you less.”",

        "content": "Headlines are sizzling with Bronny James’ potential pair-up with his dad. LeBron James ’ unyielding longevity is about to realize another feat unheard of in the NBA. While NBA enthusiasts wonder where the two will end up teaming up with each other, Rich Paul recently spilled some beans about it opening a can of worms. Fans have already deciphered the message speculating LBJ’s exit from the Lakers, however, Skip Bayless believes otherwise. On ‘UNDISPUTED’ , Bayless made it clear that despite the comments by the “ masterful ” businessman, Bron isn’t leaving the Purple and Gold for a swansong with the Cleveland Cavaliers. For him, the writing is on the wall since James has “ two beautiful places ” in LA and is reaping humungous rewards in the boisterous marketplace. As a cherry on top, Bayless posited that since his son has also been living in LA for a long time, the best move is to stay put with one of the most recognizable franchises in the world. Additionally, as per the vet, Anthony Davis will also accompany them. “ In the end, LeBron will be a Laker, Bronny will be a Laker, and AD will do whatever LeBron says ,” Bayless claimed. The FS1 analyst is steadfast that the father-son duo will share the hardwood for the Lakers. At the same time, there has been a lot of buzz about LBJ leaving the Lakers to pair up with his 19-year-old son. Rich Paul’s comments have now added to the intrigue. Where will LeBron James head to next? During Game 2 between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves, Rich Paul, a guest on TNT’s ‘AltCast’ talked about LBJ’s future, “ Look, LeBron’s a free agent. I gotta focus on his business and who should be paying about his business” . This “ free agent ” labeling raised eyebrows since James is eligible for a $51.4 million extension by June 29, and wouldn’t be a free agent until he decides to opt out. Chris Haynes, who was a part of the coverage, capitalized on this slip-up and urged Paul to lay out the details but he was naturally hesitant to do so. Furthermore, LBJ was spotted on the sidelines of the Cavaliers’ home during Game 4 between the Cavs and the Celtics in the ECSF. This sighting set off a firestorm about James returning to the franchise that drafted him and finishing his career with them. To complicate matters further, there has been a ton of chatter about King James possibly leaving for the Dallas Mavericks . There are murmurs about the Mavs drafting Bronny James if he falls into their lap as the last pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Thus, some expect the 4x Finals MVP to join his son, alongside Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. While each offseason brings a plethora of rumors about James, the 2024 offseason has the highest intrigue because of Bronny James’ inclusion in the NBA.",

        "content": "A Calgary man facing a murder charge after human remains were discovered by firefighters west of the city was in court Monday as lawyers dealt with a conflict issue. Christopher Stack, 39, faces a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kyle Schuiling, 33. Court records suggest police aren't sure when Schuiling was killed. The offence dates listed on court documents show Stack is accused of murdering Schuiling between April 1 and April 3, 2024. Lawyer in conflict Schuiling's body was found by members of the Tsuut'ina Nation Fire Department as they were extinguishing a grass fire in Rocky View County near Range Road 40 and Township Road 241 early in the morning of April 3. Police charged Stack a month after Schuiling's remains were discovered. Stack was also in court Monday on other, unrelated charges, including possession of stolen property, driving offences and breaching court-ordered conditions. Justice Jim Ogle heard that Andrea Urquhart, Stack's lawyer on his previous charges, cannot act for him on the murder charge because she knew the victim and is in a conflict. Instead, defence lawyer Tonii Roulston will take the case. Stack will be back in court in two weeks.",

        "description": "Unlicensed miners are being arrested for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems.",
        "content": "Miners work at an illegal tin mining site in Jos, Nigeria on April 3, 2024. Nigeria is seeking to regulate mining of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. Sunday Alamba/Associated Press ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigeria’s government is cracking down on illegal mining, making dozens of arrests of unlicensed miners since April for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems. The recent arrests come as Nigeria seeks to regulate its mining operations of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. The clean energy transition, a shift away from coal, oil and gas and toward renewable energy and batteries has spiked global demand for lithium, tin and other minerals. Illegal mines are rife in the country’s fledging industry as corruption among regulatory officials is common and the mineral deposits are located in remote areas with minimal government presence. Officials say profits from illicit mining practices has helped arm militia groups in the north of the county. In the most recent arrests in mid-May, a joint team of soldiers and police conducted a raid on a remote market in Kishi, in the country’s southwestern Oyo State. Locals said the market, once known for selling farm produce, has become a center for illicit trade in lithium mined in hard-to-reach areas. The three-day operation resulted in the arrest of 32 individuals, including two Chinese nationals, local workers and mineral traders, according to the state government and locals. Loads of lithium were also seized. Jimoh Bioku, a Kishi community leader, said there had been “clandestine searches” for the mineral at remote sites tucked away in the bush in the past years by Chinese nationals before “they engaged people to dig for them and turned the market into a transit point.” The community was “particularly worried about the insecurity that usually follows illegal mining and that was why we reported to the state government,” he said. China is the dominant player in the global EV supply chain, including in Nigeria where China-owned companies employ mostly vulnerable people leaving Nigeria’s far north – ravaged by conflicts and rapid desertification – to work in mining operations throughout the country. China’s nationals and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining. There have been at least three cases of illegal mining arrests involving Chinese nationals in two months. President Bola Tinubu has repeatedly blamed illegal mining for the worsening conflicts in the country’s north and asked the international community for help to stop the problem, which provides armed groups with the proceeds needed to sustain and arm themselves. The Chinese embassy in Abuja did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the arrests and claims of illegal operations. But in a statement last year following a report by The Times of London alleging Chinese miners were bribing militants for access, the embassy said it “always encouraged and urged the Chinese companies and nationals in Nigeria to abide by the laws and regulations of Nigeria.” Nigeria is emerging as a new source of lithium in Africa as the world’s largest producers, like Australia and Chile, are unable to fulfill the growing demand worldwide. But illegal activities thrive in Nigeria’s extractive sector, denying the government due revenues, said Emeka Okoro, whose Lagos-based SBM Intelligence firm has researched illicit mining and terrorism financing in northern Nigeria. And the combination of conflict and climate change effects, such as once fertile land rapidly turning into useless arid sand in northern Nigeria, has produced a cheap workforce for mining sites. The arrests of “both Chinese nationals and young Hausa boys from conflict-affected regions underscore a troubling pattern,” Okoro told the AP. “The socioeconomic strain stemming from conflict and the repercussions of climate change has given rise to a vulnerable demographic desperate for survival.” To fight resource theft that causes losses of $9 billion to the government annually, according to the country’s extractive industry transparency watchdog, the West African nation has set up a 2,200-strong “corps of mining marshals” earlier in the year. While existing law enforcement agencies are still combating the problem, the new corps is geared at curbing “the nefarious activities of illegal miners,” said Segun Tomori, spokesperson for the solid minerals ministry. Before the Kishi raid, the mining corps arrested two trucks laden with lithium on the outskirts of the capital Abuja in April. Later that month, the corps raided a location in Karu, Nasarawa State, near Abuja, leading to the arrest of four Chinese nationals and the seizure of tons of lithium. Tomori said the cases are now in court. On April 22, a federal court in Ilorin, in the north-central region, convicted two Chinese nationals for illegal mining and sentenced them to a one-year jail term, although with an option of a fine. Nigeria has long neglected the solid minerals sector, which allows some communities like the northern-central town of Jos — which is tin-abundant — to depend on subsistence mining for their livelihood. For those communities where livelihood is tied to mining, Tomori said the government is encouraging artisanal miners there to form cooperatives and operate legally. Success.

        "description": "Enhance your hi-fi experience with a solid phono preamp. Whether you're an aspiring hobbyist or vetted vinyl collector, our list has options for everyone.",
        "content": "Whether you’re a hi-fi hobbyist or a , one of the best investments you can make for your is a phono preamp. Also known as a phono stage, these mostly compact external preamplifiers take the low signal output created by turntable cartridges and boost it so it's loud enough for the , , or powered speakers to amplify. Some models can even let you fine-tune the sound and output to match a specific cartridge you might be using. While many modern turntables and devices include their own built-in phono preamps, getting your own can give you more control over your sound and even improve it byadding balance, stability, smoothness, clarity and even better sound staging. Certain preamps also include additional features, like the ability to switch between more common moving magnet (MM) phono cartridges and higher-end moving coil (MC) cartridges, should you be getting into more audiophile-level territory. There are hundreds of phono preamps to choose from, so we’ve put together this list of the best models on the market. Our roundup includes options for LP first-timers, audiophiles, and those looking to score a phono preamp for a great price. Rega is well-known for its best-in-class turntables and amplifiers. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is designed as a phono preamp for the more common MM (moving magnet) cartridges only — you typically only see MC (moving coil) cartridges in higher-end turntables. There is an MC-only version though, the , should you venture into MC territory. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is affordable, simple to set up and use, and provides detailed and noise-free playback, with just enough punch and energy to reproduce any type of music just as the artist intended. Without getting too bogged down in the minutia of the tech, a phono stage has the job of amplifying the weak signal from the cartridge, yes, but it also must process the equalization standards applied to all vinyl records by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to produce a tonally even audio signal. What makes the Fono MM Mk5 unique is that it splits the RIAA equalization into two stages — the regular signal path and the RIAA equalization circuits. This separation allows the Mk5 to provide cleaner and distortion-free playback. With a signal gain of around 41 decibels, the Mk5 is comparable to most other phono stages in this price range. Physically, the Fono Mk5 is pretty no-frills and is about the size of a paperback novel. The aluminum case fits in with the look of Rega’s other products. Also, the preamp’s aesthetics will look great amid modern hi-fi setups. While it’s pricier than some of the other products on our list, the Rega Fono MM Mk5 is an excellent choice for beginner LP owners and audiophiles alike. Phono preamps don’t get much more basic than the Rolls VP29, but sometimes simple is all you need. Measuring 3.25 inches wide, 2 inches tall, and 1.5 inches from front to back, the Rolls VP29 is just large enough to house RCA ins and outs, a 3.5mm output, a grounding post, and a power connection. The internal circuitry is designed to deliver fine-tuned playback that matches the RIAA equalization curve, and the VP29 delivers 42 decibels of gain. Keep in mind that this preamp is meant for signal conversion only. If you’re looking for a phono stage with adjustable gain and EQ settings, you’ll want to look elsewhere. In fact, not even the volume of the headphone output can be adjusted. Still, for under $70, the Rolls VP29 Phono Preamp is a plug-and-play winner that gets the job done. The Cambridge Audio Alva Duo is a diverse phono preamp that's good for both older vinyl and new (more on this below). Under the hood, a cutting-edge switch mode power supply reduces hum, and a surface-mounted circuit board further reduces noise for clean and ultra-quiet playback. They’re also connected in a way that prioritizes short signal paths, resulting in fast and precise timing. And consistent with the quality of sound that Cambridge is known for with its , the Duo offers rich, smooth sound with a wide soundstage. The Alva Duo’s subsonic filter and balance control mean that the preamp all but eliminates the low-frequency rumbles that come from scratches and scuffs on a record, as well as those that can come from an unbalanced cartridge. We’re also glad to see a 1/4-inch (6.35mm) headphone jack for private listening. While some users claim the headphone amp isn’t powerful enough, it’s still a thoughtful addition. The Alva Duo only consumes half a watt of power in standby and automatically powers down after 20 minutes of not being used, which saves energy. Pro-Ject Audio makes some of the best turntables around, so it stands to reason that it knows its way around a phono stage, too. The main idea behind the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC (or any phono stage, really) is to deliver a balanced, low-noise signal that is packed with as much precision and depth as possible. Pro-Ject achieves this by implementing high-quality circuitry that cuts down on distortion and other audible issues. It's compatible with both MM and MC cartridge types, and switching between either setup is handled with the simple push of a button. The Phono Box pushes up to 40 decibels for MM cartridges and 60 decibels for MC systems. For less than $150, you’re getting a phono preamp with gold-plated inputs and outputs and dual-mono circuitry for optimized performance. It’s a minimalist piece of equipment that will have no problem fitting in with your other AV gear. While it doesn’t have as many settings as other preamps, the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC is an ideal middle-ground between entry-level phono stages and preamps that cost thousands of dollars. The Musical Fidelity MX-VYNL is a premium phono preamp that sounds refined and detailed, excels at vocals, is deliciously full-sounding, and is even a bit forward (and smooth) in the low end. For its $850 price tag, it should do all that and more for those with premium turntables to pair it with -- and it does. Engineered for well-balanced and detail-focused performance, the MX-VYNL is compatible with MM and MC cartridges. It’s also one of the only phono stages to include both a standard RCA input and a balanced single XLR 5-pin input. Not only does this allow for connecting two turntables simultaneously, but the balanced input allows for much less noise. The MX-VYNL also features RCA outputs, as well as balanced XLR outputs, which are much quieter, but can deliver more precise and fuller sound than the RCA, should you have a compatible amplifier to connect to. The MX-VYNL goes ever further with fine-tuning features, with its dial for switching between MC and MM, and the ability to adjust cartridge impedance to perfectly match any given cartridge. Unlike other phono stages with these controls, you’ll actually be able to adjust settings during playback too. The MX-VYNL is also one of the best preamps for RIAA correction, letting you choose between it and the newer IEC equalization curve. It's definitely more advanced than most of the other phono stages on our list, but if you're heading in the direction of audiophile sound, then a phono preamp like this might be a good place to start. The Fosi Audio Box X2 leans on vintage engineering and delivers big results with its two vacuum tubes that are front and center. Thanks to low-noise integrated circuitry and top-shelf components, the X2 is designed to remove as much low-frequency noise as possible during LP playback, so you’ll always have crystal clear sound. You’ll be able to choose from 39-, 42-, and 45-decibel gain settings, so you’ll never have to worry about having enough power to match your MM cartridge -- but in case you have one that needs a little boost, it's there. We’re also glad to see an onboard tube preamp with a 3.5mm AUX input. Conveniently, the X2’s vacuum tubes can be swapped for other tube models. An excellent feature for hi-fi fans, this means you’ll be able to experiment with different makes and models to get the sound you like for your amplifier and speakers. Developed by legendary master circuit designer John Curl, the man behind the equally legendary Vendetta Research phono preamp, the Parasound JC3+ Phono Preamp is a sturdy, feature-rich component that audiophiles praise for its wide soundstage, realistic imaging, refined detail retrieval, and excellent neutrality. Featuring Vampire 24K gold-plated RCA inputs and unbalanced outputs, as well as balanced Neutrik XLR outputs, all of the JC3+ connections are designed for minimal noise and hum. This same principle carries over to the 24K gold-plated copper traces on the phono module boards. Even the power supplies and AC wires use low-carbon mild steel partitions to deliver the clearest signal possible. The JC3+ also includes an integrated Mono switch for enhancing the quality of older mono LPs, on top of an AC polarity reverse switch for dialing down the hum that many systems generate. Impedance adjustment dials and variable MC, fixed MC, and MM selection options allow for precise pairing with a wide range of moving coil and moving magnet cartridges. The Parasound JC3+ is more of a boutique component than many others, and its price reflects that.

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

ALSO READ: Hajj 2024: Gov Yusuf inaugurates first flight of Kano pilgrims According to a statement signed by the spokesman of the party, Hassan Sahabi Sanyinawal, and made available to newsmen on Monday, the party said not fewer than five states have made provisions to support their pilgrims. The statement said, “the party wishes the intending pligrims for the 2024 exercise a safe trip and successful Hajj. “As the first batch of the Sokoto state intending pilgrims will start departing to Saudi Arabia tomorrow, the PDP hereby urges our pilgrims to be good ambassadors of our great state in the holy land and use the opportunity to pray for peace and tranquility and progress in Sokoto State and Nigeria as a whole. “We also wish to remind the governmeng of Sokoto State that it is not too late to emulate other states in Nigeria and provide reliefs on the Hajj for our 2024 pilgrims. “The party notes with concern and sincere amazement, that while governments of states like Rivers have since provided subsidies for their intending Muslim faithfuls to enable them pay the Hajj fare, that of Sokoto State, which the center of the Islamic faith in the country, has remain unconcerned and mute on the issue. “It has come to our notice that so far, the Federal Government and six states in the country have given aide to pilgrims to offset the high fare for this year’s pilgrimage. These are Kebbi, Rivers, Jigawa, Bauchi, Yobe and Kano.” The statement further said, “Sokoto State PDP, wishes to remind the APC regime in our state that all previous administrations, in spite of the lean resources available to them, had provided subsidies to pilgrims towards a successful Hajj, which is one of the pillars of Islam. “We therefore see no reason that the current administration that is enjoying an unprecedented availability of funds, should fail to sustain the noble gesture.”",

        "content": "The rhythmic drums, hundreds taking to the streets and colourful characters – it can only mean Combe Martin has spent the bank holiday weekend Hunting the Earl of Rone. The unique custom sees villagers don their costumes to seek out the elusive ‘earl’ with processions on each day accompanied by characters including the Hobby Horse, Fool and a troop of Grenadiers. It began on Friday evening, then on Saturday local children have their own junior procession, followed by a mazy Sunday afternoon affair and finally culminating in the grand finale on Monday evening, when hundreds join the hunt. The Earl is finally located, captured and led down the long village street to the sea seated backwards on a donkey. He is ‘shot’ several times before being revived and finally at sunset is cast into the sea. The popular annual event is joined by many in the village and is a great spectacle for visitors, as well as an opportunity for more than a little revelry and merriment! Participants in this year’s event also remembered Phyllis Ackland, who passed away very recently aged 96 – Phyllis was a long-term and enthusiastic supporter of the Earl of Rone and took part for many years.

        "content": "A resident of a shelter for medically vulnerable people experiencing homelessness is accused of killing a roommate Sunday, less than six months after the facility opened . The 62-year-old woman killed, named in a probable cause affidavit as Stephanie Lynne Hackett Carrasco, was staying at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy. One of Carrasco’s two roommates woke up from a nap to find her draped in bed sheets, laying under her bed face down in a pool of blood with blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Sandy police arrested another roommate — a 60-year-old woman — on suspicion of murder and tampering with evidence. The Salt Lake Tribune generally does not name defendants unless they have been formally charged with a crime. According to the probable cause affidavit explaining the woman’s arrest, Carrasco was seen on security footage entering the room for the last time, and cameras captured the roommate accused of killing her leaving the room 40 minutes later. The affidavit says the roommate had “her arms full of what appears to be clothing and other personal items.” When the other roommate awoke and saw Carrasco unconscious, she reportedly called emergency medical services. Paramedics declared Carrasco dead when they arrived at the scene. Police noticed spots of blood on a red fanny pack the accused roommate was carrying when she returned to the room. The probable cause affidavit states police had not yet searched the room, but that detectives hoped to look for an object that could have been used to cause the injuries to Carrasco’s head. The roommate who allegedly struck and killed Carrasco declined to make a statement to police without a lawyer. It is unclear if she has retained an attorney. She is currently being held at Salt Lake County jail and has been denied bail. (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A room at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy on Friday, Dec. 8, 2023. A resident there is accused of killing her roommate Sunday. The Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility is located on 9000 South near Interstate 15 in Sandy, in a former EconoLodge motel. The facility is funded by both taxpayers and philanthropy. Michelle Flynn, the director of The Road Home — and organization that helps operate the facility — said in a statement Monday afternoon, “The events ... are tragic, our hearts are with those involved.” “The MVP program provides a safe and supportive environment where residents can rehabilitate from illness by accessing the necessary health care and care management services to find stability to move toward permanent housing and other long-term care solutions,” Flynn continued. “We are unwavering in our commitment to safety, ensuring a welcoming and secure environment for all those who seek refuge with us. We are working closely with law enforcement and other crisis services to support residents and staff. We will continue to work with our community partners to support ongoing needs as they arise.” The Salt Lake Tribune reported in December that the facility was designed to serve 165 people in need of specialized care, and that residents would either have their own rooms or share a room with one other person, depending on their condition. At the time of Sunday’s killing, three women were sharing a room.",

        "content": "VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis used a highly derogatory term towards the LGBT community as he reiterated in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops that gay people should not be allowed to become priests, Italian media reported on Monday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, Italy's largest circulation dailies, both quoted the pope as saying seminaries, or priesthood colleges, are already too full of \"frociaggine\", a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \"faggottness\". The Vatican did not respond to a request for comment. La Repubblica attributed its story to several unspecified sources, while Corriere said it was backed up by a few, unnamed bishops, who suggested the pope, as an Argentine, might have not realised that the Italian term he used was offensive. Political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff. Francis, who is 87, has so far been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church into taking a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT community. In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\", while last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash. Nevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals. In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years. The document said practicing homosexuals and those with \"deep-seated\" gay tendencies and those who \"support the so-called gay culture\" should be barred. REUTERS",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Favour Ugwuka’s death: Ebonyi varsity management breaks silence Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Metro Favour Ugwuka’s death: Ebonyi varsity management breaks silence Published on May 27, 2024 By Casmir Nwankwo The management of Ebonyi State University, Abakiliki, has broken its silence over the death of Miss Favour Ugwuka, a student of the institution. Ugwuka, a final year student of EBSU in the Department of English Language and Literature, allegedly committed suicide in her hostel apartment on Wednesday, May 23, 2024. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed claims by the deceased that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu’s briefing read in part: “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass.” Professor Ogbu further stated that, according to the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, who registered in the year 2018/2019, and that is her 1st year. In her 1st year, she offered 9 courses out of which she failed 3 courses and had a CGP of 1.78. In the 2nd semester of her 1st year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. Professor Ogbu continued, “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.” The Vice Chancellor went on to detail Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice.

        "description": "Prominent proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis aired concerns about the \"excessive size\" of Musk's pay deal.",
        "content": "Tesla shareholders should reject CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, according to proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which singled out the \"excessive size\" of the deal and its potentially negative impact on smaller shareholders. The recommendation from the influential proxy advisory company comes as Tesla is asking its shareholders to vote again on his 2018 pay package after a Delaware judge earlier this year nullified the payout , which was the biggest compensation plan in corporate America. Tesla shareholders are set to vote on the pay package on June 13. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Glass Lewis' recommendation to vote against the pay deal. Proxy advisory firms are relied on by institutional investors to provide research and advice on how to vote during annual and special meetings on public companies' proxy proposals, which can range from executive compensation to corporate governance issues. In Tesla's case, Glass Lewis wrote in a 71-page report, shared with CBS MoneyWatch, that Tesla shareholders risk stock dilution if Musk is granted the massive stock grant, meaning that their shares could be worth less as a result. The proxy advisory firm also noted that Musk is well compensated through his current 12.9% ownership of Tesla, a stake that is valued at about $74 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk doesn't receive a salary from Tesla, but Glass Lewis noted that his shares in the company mean that his interests are already aligned with that of the business. Deadly Tesla crash and burn in Weston 00:27 The value of Musk's current Tesla stake \"challenges the very basis that the 2018 grant as structured and sized was even necessary,\" Glass Lewis wrote. Dilution occurs when a company issues additional stock, which in turn shrinks the proportional ownership stake of pre-existing shares. Under the 2018 pay deal for Musk, Tesla would issue about 304 million new shares, creating a dilution effect of about 9%, the firm said. \"[T]hese concerns are exacerbated by the concentration of ownership in Mr. Musk,\" the report said, noting that Musk would increase his ownership stake to 22.4% if the 2018 pay package were to be approved next month. \"Mr. Musk would be the Company's largest shareholder by a healthy margin.\" It added, \"Given the impact on the holdings of other shareholders, the continued concentration of ownership around Mr. Musk warrants particular attention.\" More from CBS News Fired up about barbecue costs this Memorial Day?

        "description": "Change means that any body of water that meets the state definition of 'public water' will be granted legal protection, even if it isn't on the decades-old state inventory",
        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said.",

        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. ADVERTISEMENT The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” ADVERTISEMENT He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "North Korea said it launched a rocket that was carrying a spy satellite but exploded mid-air. However, the US claimed the rocket involved technologies related to Pyongyang's intercontinental ballistic missile program. North Korea said a rocket that it launched to carry a into space exploded mid-air on Monday. \"The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage,\" the deputy director general of Pyongyang's said in a report carried by state media. An \"expert review concluded that the cause of the accident was the operational reliability of the newly developed liquid oxygen and oil engine,\" the report added. The launch followed just a few hours after North Korea issued a warning saying it would try to launch a satellite by June 4. The country successfully launched its first spy satellite last November, following two other fiery crashes in 2023. Footage broadcast by Japanese network NHK showed what appeared to be a flaming projectile in the night sky. Neighbors condemn rocket launch The North Korean rocket launch was slammed by neighboring countries. South Korea's called it \"a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.\" Defense Minister Minoru Kihara also said the launch posed \"a serious challenge to the entire world.\" Meanwhile, the United States claimed that the rocket launch was \"a brazen violation\" of UN Security Council resolutions. \"This launch involved technologies that are directly related to (North Korea's) intercontinental ballistic missile program,\" the US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement. Monday's launch came hours after leaders from China, Japan and South Korea met in Seoul for to discuss a potential free trade deal. It's unusual for North Korea to take provocative action while China is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. zc/msh (AFP, AP, Reuters)",

        "content": "Alberta’s police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says there are reasonable grounds to believe two Lethbridge police officers committed offences when they did a criminal record check on local New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips. But it says the Alberta Prosecution Service determined the circumstances didn’t meet its test to go to court. 1:45 Final arguments made on Lethbridge MLA’s LPS surveillance appeal The information is contained in a letter from the agency to the politician’s lawyer, Michael Bates.

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks’ duo of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have raised the clutch quotient of the 2024 playoffs, especially after their fourth-quarter heroics against the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Conference Finals. However, some folks have taken things a bit too far and have started touting Irving and Luka as the best clutch duo in the history of the game. 2008 NBA Champion Paul Pierce, who was a renowned clutch shooter in his day, pointed out why we need to pump the brakes on this thought. Pierce posited that the Mavs’ superstar duo first needs to prove themselves in the NBA Finals to even be in the conversation for such a grandiose title. The Truth reminded fans that even he and Ray Allen were one of the most clutch duos in NBA history during their Celtics tenure, and their tandem actually won the title. Pierce also cited the example of Stephen Curry’s deadly combination with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, which led to multiple titles as well. On the other hand, the Irving-Doncic pairing is yet to win one. Then the 46-year-old quipped that Michael Jordan is in a league of his own when it comes to clutch moments. “ We got [on the best clutch duos’ list] Curry-Klay, Curry-Durant, LeBron-Kyrie, and then Jordan and the towel boy. Anybody with Jordan, Jordan with Scottie, Jordan with popcorn man, Jordan and the towel, Jordan is the ultimate clutch man ,” Paul Pierce told Keyshawn Johnson and Skip Bayless. The 2008 champion relayed that until Doncic and Irving’s playoff “ run is over ”, it is futile to rank them among the best clutch duos of all time. As per Pierce, if they shine on the NBA’s biggest stage, then the conversation would make more sense. At any rate, the fact that they are even figuring in such narratives before the Finals speaks volumes about their achievements. Shaquille O’Neal is in awe of the Kyrie-Doncic one-two punch Shaq and Kobe wreaked havoc in the NBA world and didn’t spare anyone on their path to a three-peat. They are surely one of the scariest duos of all time. However, the Kai-Doncic formula has managed to surpass them in a major category. After Game 2, a graphic started to make rounds on the Internet featuring the best-scoring performances from duos in modern NBA history. It shows that while Shaq and Kobe combined for 57.5 points during the 2002-03 season, the Mavs’ guard duo compiled 59.5 points during the 2023-24 season. They just trail James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who managed a whopping 61.5 points per game during the 2019-20 season. O’Neal shared this graphic on his Instagram stories to appreciate the Mavs’ killer guard combo. Meanwhile, Trae Young also feels that Kai is the perfect complement to the 2024 NBA scoring leader. Additionally, Paulo Banchero termed them “ professional closers ” whereas Stan Van Gundy dubbed them the “ greatest backcourt in NBA history ”. Therefore, the duo has certainly elevated their profile during the playoffs, and with a foot already in the NBA finals, they will likely garner further glory.",

        "content": "Cambodia and China, through the Cambodian Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), are enhancing cooperation in investigating and extraditing suspects between the two countries. The collaboration was discussed during a meeting between ACU Chairman Om Yentieng and Song Fulong, Secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC and Chairman of the State Inspection Committee of Guangdong Province, at the ACU yesterday. Song stated that the CPC is committed to integrity, which creates a transparent society, and has a strict anti-corruption system under the supervision of 600 officials in Guangdong. “We have no tolerance for corruption. We continue to promote the fight against bureaucracy, corruption, wastefulness, and inactivity. Our entire political system needs to constantly refine its policies, mechanisms, and regulations to ensure accountability without hesitancy or corruption,” he said. He noted that China and Cambodia share similar anti-corruption procedures, which will further enhance future cooperation in these areas. Yentieng highlighted that the ACU’s strategy against corruption focuses on education, prevention, and enforcement, culminating in legal proceedings. He added that education and prevention constitute 80% of the unit’s efforts, aiming to instill a mindset where individuals “do not want to be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not dare to be corrupt”. The meeting underscored the ongoing commitment of the two nations to strengthen solidarity, friendship, and bilateral cooperation. The Chinese delegation pledged to deepen and improve cooperation within the framework of Guangdong province and the ACU. The Cambodian and Chinese delegations discussed enhancing exchanges and cooperation in investigations, with a joint commitment to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. They also focused on improving cooperation in tracking, arresting, and detaining fugitives. The Chinese side extended an invitation to Yentieng to visit China at his convenience, to foster more robust collaboration in both the short and long term. The Cambodian delegation showcased their operational facilities to the Chinese visitors, including the Complaints Analysis, Polygraph, Operations, Interrogation, and Holding Rooms for suspects or detainees, as well as the Assets and Debt Collection Warehouse of the ACU. Pech Pisey, Executive Director of Transparency International Cambodia (TIC), said previously that the cooperation between Cambodia and China in the fight against abuse of power is beneficial. He noted that China is using anti-corruption strategies to reform the CPC, and these offer valuable insights for Cambodia, especially for the ACU. However, he added that it is important to discern which aspects are applicable given the differences between Cambodia’s democratic system and China’s communist regime. During a meeting between Senate President Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian yesterday, the latter characterised Sino-Cambodian relations as a model of international relations. He expressed gratitude towards Cambodia for its equitable stance on contentious issues such as the South China Sea, Taiwan, and the Xinjiang region, highlighting the importance of these positions in safeguarding the interests of both Sino-Cambodian and ASEAN-China relations. Wang added that although the global situation has changed, relations between China and Cambodia have not.",

Even today, the former couple have fans who wish their reunion, despite knowing that it's a wild goose chase. An old video snippet of the couple is now going viral on social media. The video snippet is from an interview that the actors attended together when they were in the relationship . In the video, Chaitanya and Samantha are seen playing a game. Samantha wore headphones with blasting music, and she had to guess what Naga Chaitanya was saying. As the game starts, Samantha excitedly says, “We are going to play a game where I have to guess what he is saying.” When Samantha wore the headphones, Naga asked what song she was hearing, and Samantha responded, “Some English song, huh?” To which Naga Chaitanya responds, “Cheating. You can hear me.” Later when the volume is increased, Naga tests it once again and says, “You’re not looking good... Okay, you can’t hear me good.” Samantha asks Naga, “Say?” Next when Naga Chaitanya says, “Na Family Joliki Ravodhu”, Samantha guesses it, as “I’m in love with you.” Naga Chaitanya is undoubtedly delighted to hear it and he blushes. The fans of the former couple have shared it on social media. Check out the video here Meanwhile, Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu parted ways in 2021.

        "description": "From tickets to food to hotel to parking, families need hundreds of dollars to afford the Disney \"magic.\"",
        "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. — It's the \"most magical place on Earth\" but what's the actual cost of all that Disney magic ? For many families, a trip to one (or several) of Walt Disney World's four Florida theme parks — the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom — is a dream vacation. But in order to make those dreams a reality, knowing the price tag before being transported to a \"whole new world\" is key. We found an average family of four could spend at least $800 for just one day at one of the Orlando-area parks. Here's a deep dive into the current average cost of a Disney World vacation for a family of four. Tickets Currently, the price for a standard, single-day ticket to any of Walt Disney World's four theme parks starts at $109. That doesn't account for extra fees, taxes, holidays or park hopper options. It's also important to note each park can be priced differently, depending on the day. Typically, the highest prices are for the Magic Kindom and Hollywood Studios while EPCOT and Animal Kingdom tend to be lower. Single-day prices can range from $109 to $189, according to Disney's booking website. Disney does have a couple of offers for multi-day ticket packages that drop the price of a single-day ticket slightly, depending on which option you choose. Florida residents can save a little more on these multi-day ticket packages. Single-day ticket: $109+ Annual pass: $1,449 Florida resident Discover Disney 3-day ticket deal: $219 Total average single-day ticket cost for a family of four at a Walt Disney World theme park: $464.36 - $805.16 after taxes. Again, this does not account for a multi-day ticket bundle, or additional features or perks. Reservations: Depending on what type of ticket you have, you may need to reserve your spot before heading to the theme park. To see if your ticket requires a reservation, click or tap here. Discounts: Discounted tickets can be purchased for members of different businesses and organizations, including GOVX , AAA , AARP , Costco , and Sam's Club . Food & drink Whether you're staying for a single day or strapping in for an extra-long vacation at Disney, staying fed and hydrated is essential, especially in the hot Florida sun. According to Disney's website , food items can range from $15 to more than $60 per person. According to travel blog Mickey Visit , it's not unusual to spend anywhere from $50-$80 per person during a typical day at a Disney World park. For a family of four, that equates to between $200-$320 per day for food. For drinks, Mickey Visit says non-alcoholic drinks average about $5 and $12 for alcoholic ones. Guests who book a Disney resort hotel package can also buy a dining plan. Those plans, depending on which option you choose and the duration of your stay, appear to range from between $60-$100 per person each day. You can get more information by clicking or tapping here . Hotel Even if you are a Florida resident, many Disney World parkgoers don't live super close to Orlando, meaning a hotel stay even overnight needs to be factored into the cost of a Disney trip. Of course, Disney offers several resorts and hotels — more than 30— for guests. For a standard room at a Disney hotel or resort, the average per-night stay for a family of 4 ranges from under $200 to over $900. Depending on the time of year, those prices can fluctuate even more. For those looking outside Disney property, hotel prices near the theme park start as low as around $100 per night. Parking If you and your family are staying at a Disney World resort, parking is typically complimentary, except at certain locations. But if you're coming from off Disney property, the standard parking at Disney's four theme parks is $30 per day and preferred parking is $45, $50, or $55 per day. Disney Genie+ If you and your family are banking on riding your favorite rides, getting Disney Genie+ may be your best option. This replaced the old FastPass system back in 2021. While prices vary depending on the attraction and dates, the service per ticket starts at $15. How much will a Disney vacation cost a family of four? Adding all the lowest-option costs, here's how much an average 1-day stay at Walt Disney World would be for a family of four. This total does not include airfare. Tickets: $464.36 Food & drink: $200 Hotel: $100 Parking: $30 4 Disney Genie+ passes: $15 Average 1-day grand total: $854.36",

        "content": "Midland residents feeling frustration over the downtown increase of abuse and harassment by “problem folks” might be relieved to know that the police and town council are trying to remedy the complex issue. During an update on increased police enforcement in downtown Midland, Southern Georgian Bay OPP detachment commander Inspector Todd Pittman revealed a few eye-opening facts for members of town council. The update at the committee of the whole was to allow Pittman to provide information on the 2023 to 2025 detachment action plan for addressing and preventing crime in the community as well as a focus on the waterways, roadways and trail systems. Several statistics he cited reflected a similar presentation he had made to Tay Township council earlier in the month. However, Pittman didn’t get far into his Midland presentation before asking council for input, and receiving more than a fair share of it. Coun. Sheldon East, in his first appearance since taking time off for medical leave, hit hard with anecdotes he had received from downtown business owners who were fearful to leave their businesses at night for their vehicles but who were accosted by people asking for money and valuables. “The parking lots – especially downtown and up by the Tim Hortons on the highway – are very heavily populated with aggression,” said East. “Unfortunately, it paints an image that the downtown core isn’t safe, when it really is; it’s just there’s certain areas that might just need a little bit more attention.” He followed up by requesting a greater police presence during those times. OPP staffing is at an all-time high, according to Pittman, and his response to East was that the detachment would be coming into its busiest season ever based on past trends. “One of the things that I’m prepared to do, and something that I’m prepared to take to the officers, is to put out proactive (community) patrols,” said Pittman, cautioning that an evidence-based approach would require knowing what those locations and times were to maximize efficiency. Coun. Bill Meridis addressed issues of substance and alcohol abuse in the core, citing personal observations and anecdotes regarding local instances; one such involved a business owner discovering a user in their store bathroom. “The last thing we need is our financial institutions leaving our downtown core,” stated Meridis, expressing frustration at being a town councillor unable to remedy the overall problem. “The open drug use, the alcohol – it’s hurting our downtown, it’s hurting our community. “When we transitioned to OPP from Midland Police Service, our level of service to our community shouldn’t go down. At that time councillors that were on, sitting in this position, I’m pretty sure they didn’t vote for that,” Meridis said, alleging that the community perceived the OPP as not being informed to who was entering the town and who was local, unlike the Midland Police Service. Pittman countered that OPP knew the newcomers, and stated it was “an unintended consequence” of the shelter system that police were dealing with. “We actually do know who’s up here; we have a lot of people from Toronto that are not a part of this community that are wanted on warrants, that are violent people that we’ve actually arrested and asked to ship back because of their warrants,” said Pittman. Coun. Jamie-Lee Ball also expressed frustration while relating community requests regarding the drug house they lived beside, noting that residents have moved away from Midland as a result. “Why are these not shut down?” Ball asked. “I see that there’s been charges laid, but it’s not with every owner of the home, it’s not with every resident in the home. When you’re picking people up from these drug houses, you pick them up at 5:00 a.m. and they’re back selling drugs at 5:00 p.m. What am I supposed to tell residents about that?” Pittman noted that in the last five years, the OPP had laid 22,777 charges with 45 percent withdrawn by the court, stating: “I think it’s going to take a systemic change to fix this problem.” Several times during the conversation, he had pointed to the root causes leading to issues in the downtown including poverty, addiction, and a lack of affordable and attainable housing. As a path for council to pursue, Pittman noted that Penetanguishene had chosen to write a letter “...petitioning the Ministry of the Attorney General saying we need to do better. We need to hold people accountable. Our communities expect it, our police are out there doing the work, our citizens deserve it, we deserve to feel safe in our communities – and (for council) to get behind that.” Other members of council offered their support and thanks. Coun. Catherine MacDonald reiterated that a community safety symposium scheduled will meet again later this year; Roberta Bald offered her knowledge as a retired member of the Crown; and Deputy Mayor Beth Prost said she felt relieved that Pittman was responsive to council’s concerns in finding a remedy. Following the meeting, Mayor Bill Gordon told MidlandToday that while “the eye-opener was that a lot of the problem folks that we’re dealing with here are not locals” wasn’t a shock, the hour-long discussion with council hadn’t raised one key factor contributing to the issue. “You look at the top three communities for homelessness in Simcoe County, we all have the exact same things in common; Barrie, Orillia and Midland,” said Gordon. “A plethora of amazing support services, which is a blessing and a curse; it’s a waterfront community; and we have a county-funded shelter. So, what do you do? “None of these things we can change, nor should we. But it’s one of the reasons – and the same appeal that draws people to move here and yearn to stay living here – it shouldn’t come as a shock that if you’re down on your luck or hopelessly addicted... if you’re going to suffer like that, why wouldn’t you want to suffer in a beautiful community like ours?” Gordon agreed that throwing more police at the issue wasn’t the solution due to capacity and cost, as Pittman had also stated earlier in the evening while remarking on root causes. Council meetings are held every third Wednesday, and can be viewed on Rogers TV cable channel 53 when available, or through the livestream on the Rogers TV website. Archives of council meetings are available through Rogers TV and on the Town of Midland’s YouTube channel.",

        "content": "WALMART has ended its relationship with Capital One, which was the exclusive provider of its store credit card . Current cardholders will still be able to use their cards and accrue rewards. Walmart and Capital One have announced the end of their credit card partnership. Customers can no longer apply for the Capital One Walmart Rewards Card. Walmart is aiming to introduce a replacement credit card no later than January 2025 but has not yet announced the new bank it will use to provide the card. Potential partners could include major credit card companies Discover, MasterCard , and American Express . A spokesperson previously told The U.S. Sun: \"We look forward to bringing our customers a new credit card option that provides meaningful benefits and rewards soon.” Meanwhile, current Capital One Walmart Rewards cardholders can continue to use their cards and access the cashback savings. The Capital One Walmart Rewards Card is a cashback card that offers up to 5% back on Walmart purchases. Walmart sued Capital One in April 2023 to prematurely end its agreement with the lender. Walmart claimed that the bank had not fulfilled its customer service obligations. These included issuing replacement cards to customers within five days, and promptly posting payment and transaction information to customers’ accounts. In March, a judge ruled in favor of Walmart. The Capital One Walmart Rewards Card was popular among shoppers, with a total of $8.5 billion in existing loans in the Walmart credit card portfolio. Walmart's partnership with the lender began in 2019 after it ended its previous credit card deal with Synchrony Financial. The Walmart Capital One Rewards credit card gives cardholders a number of cashback benefits: Customers earn five percent cashback on Walmart.com, including pickup and delivery. At Walmart stores and fuel stations, at restaurants, and on travel, cardholders earn two percent cashback. For everything else, the cashback rate is one percent. Fortunately, shoppers don't need a Walmart credit card to save at the store. Customers can use third-party apps like Ibotta to score rebates just for uploading their receipts. Meanwhile, the Walmart app showcases many of the best deals and rollbacks currently on offer. Shoppers can also scan barcodes in-store using the app to discover prices that are lower than advertised on the shelf.

        "content": "The home screen layout of Apple devices has remained largely unchanged since the iPhone debuted in 2007, but an upcoming update could mean an all-new design. Although many predict that Apple's upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June will be heavily focused on artificial intelligence announcements, Bloomberg reported that iOS 18 will also let users customize their home screens. iPhone uers will be able to change the color of app icons and arrange them however they want instead of in the grid pattern Apple is known for, according to Bloomberg. While some users might sort their apps in folders today, the update could allow them to color code their home screen. Related stories Along with a new home screen and AI-powered updates to several iPhone apps, iOS 18 reportedly includes new AI-enabled emojis capabilities. By pairing generative AI with its iconic emojis, Apple would allow users to create custom specialized emojis on the spot. The tech giant will be playing catch-up at its upcoming conference following splashy AI announcements from competitors like Google and Microsoft over the past few weeks. Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives called it Apple's \"most anticipated event in a decade.\" Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, but more is expected to be revealed at WWDC, which kicks off on June 10.",

(Sherry LaVars/Marin Independent Journal) Ophelia Macdonald of the Marin Municipal Water District and Shane Lile of AmeriCorps conduct a salmon survey in Lagunitas Creek Dec. 13, 2023. (Sherry LaVars/Marin Independent Journal) After years of planning, a project to restore habitat for endangered coho salmon in Lagunitas Creek is moving forward. Last week, the board governing the Marin Municipal Water District awarded a $1.9 million construction contract to Hanford Applied Restoration and Conservation to complete what’s called project phase 1A. The work will involve strategically placing dozens of logs, boulders and, for the first time, tons of gravel within three sites of the channel to reconstruct spawning beds that were lost after the introduction of dams. The creek runs through Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Habitat complexity and quality also will increase for the endangered freshwater shrimp and threatened steelhead trout, said Jonathan Koehler, the district fisheries program manager. “Lagunitas Creek is an exceptional stream for all three of these species,” Koehler said. The species are declining regionally, but appear to be establishing a stronghold in Lagunitas, he said. So the effort has great regional significance, he said. Lagunitas Creek is home to the largest population of Central Coast coho salmon from Monterey Bay to the Sonoma County-Mendocino County border. Once believed to number in the thousands, with a habitat stretching to tributaries on Mount Tamalpais, the population of coho salmon has significantly diminished since the construction of dams. Specifically, Peters and Seeger dams have blocked fish from accessing about half of their historic spawning grounds. To be removed from federal endangered status, Lagunitas Creek coho must lay at least 1,600 nests for three consecutive winters. In the past 25 years of district monitoring, the counts have not reached half that amount. The Peters Dam at Kent Lake blocks large pieces of wood and gravel from moving downstream where salmon and steelhead spawn. The debris is vital for creating gravel beds and deep, cool pools in the creek where adult coho salmon spawn and juveniles grow during their 16-month stay in freshwater. As designed, the project incorporates both proven and new strategies to mimic the natural habitats found in the creek before the construction of dams, staff said. “So this is, I think, somewhat groundbreaking in that way,” Koehler said. Overall, the project is expected to cost $10 million to $12 million. It will enhance 13 sites encompassing 4,450 linear feet of the channel. Crews will add more than 270 logs and 11,000 tons of gravel. Koehler said each log placed in the stream will be ballasted with boulders that have been engineered to keep them in place. “The structure as you see them look like a series of sort of interlocking logs, but each one of them is individually anchored with heavy boulders that are pinned with threaded rod to basically keep them where we want them,” Koehler said. The structures are designed to break up the low-velocity stretches of the channel, create deeper, slower pools for salmon farming, capture incoming gravel for spawning and improve production of insects, which the fish eat. Each installation will be designed in a way that would enable crews to adjust the orientation if need be, Koehler said. Project construction will be split into at least three segments. Hanford, which is based in Petaluma, was selected from a pool of four contractors bidding for the project to construct phase 1A, which focuses on enhancement of three of the 13 sites. Construction is set to be completed by Nov. 22. The total cost to complete project phase 1A is estimated at $3.95 million and includes construction, management services, a 15% contingency, environmental compliance and labor. Phase 1B is scheduled for the summer of 2025 will enhance an additional five sites in the channel, using the same methods. Phases 1A and 1B are funded with $6.65 million in federal grants. The board also authorized spending about $600,000 so that the district consultants, Environmental Science Associates, can finish designing project phase 2. The design and permitting for this final phase is expected to continue through at least 2026. “This stuff is really interesting,” said Matt Samson, a member of the district board. “Not to mention the ecological benefits, but it’s such a great educational tool when we’re explaining what’s going on.” Board member Jed Smith said he has “nothing but support and pride” for the work the staff is doing. Board member Larry Russell said it’s good to see the engineering aimed at moving water most effectively and efficiently, whereas the old-school train of thought was to move water as quickly as possible. “We’ve got our arms around this and I think your design sounds exciting,” Russell told staff at the May 21 meeting.",

        "content": "Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. on May 27, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. “(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,” the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelsonon May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at FortNelson General Hospital are resuming. “The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,” the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality’s mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what’s expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online on May 26, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a “tremendous amount of fire” in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Mr. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. “The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It’s had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,” he said. “And it’s not just lightning that’s going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that’s giving us a lot of challenges.”",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” ___ This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling.

Nonetheless, fans were pumped to see who the new islanders were, but that meant looking at the infamous entrance photos. They’re infamous because the photos tend to have a knack for making the stars look completely different, whether that means making a 6’1 guy look 5 feet tall or making a girl look 10 years older. However, it does seem like one islander, in particular, did not face this problem this time around. On May 27, LI fans on congratulated for pulling off an entrance photo that gives the correct impression of what she really looks like. One fan wrote, “She beat the LI photographer curse that face card is something serious.” Another fan chimed in with, “The LI photographer could not make her anything other than absolutely unbelievably stunning. Now that’s a superpower.” According to her profile with , Mimii is a 24-year-old nursing student who applied to be a part of the series on a complete whim. “My girls are my rocks and I’m theirs so I’ll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. I like dressing up so I’ll bring style, and I’d like to think I’m quite funny so I’ll make people laugh. Bringing honesty as well – I’m good at picking up on people’s personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be a liar,” she told the outlet. Needless to say, might have already found its fan-favorite, but we’ll find out more when viewers see how she fares in the villa. Related:",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.

        "content": "This week beginning May 30, Amazon will be selling Ron Nyswaner’s 2004 book Blue Days, Black Nights: A Memoir of Desire , a deeply personal look at the journey of its author who continues to be a leading voice in movies and television with a rich and varied filmography that has taken him from screenwriter to director to creator to producer and showrunner. Nyswaner joins me this week for this episode of my Deadline video series Behind the Lens. His most current project is Showtime/Paramount+’s limited series Fellow Travelers . Adapted from the book by Thomas Mallon, it follows the relationship of Hawkins Fuller (Matt Bomer) and Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey) on an emotional, rocky and heartbreaking trip from the McCarthy hearings and Lavender Scare of the ’50s in Washington, D.C. up to the AIDS crisis and tragedy of the ’80s. Nyswaner serves as executive producer, creator, writer and showrunner of the series that has been compared to The Way We Were — or, as Bomer told me, “the gay we were,” a reference to the love story of these two men during eras when it was often difficult to be your true self or risk your career and everything else.

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- The global size is estimated to grow by billion from 2024-2028, according to Technavio. The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 6.67% during the forecast period. For more insights on the forecast market size and historic data (2018 - 2022) - The global aquaculture market is witnessing a shift towards the cultivation of novel species, driven by escalating demand for protein-rich fish and seafood and the necessity to broaden the species spectrum. Traditionally, aquaculture has concentrated on a select few species, such as salmon, shrimp, and tilapia. However, the surge in demand necessitates the expansion of farmed species to include barramundi, cobia, and yellowtail kingfish, among others. These newcomers are favored for their high nutritional value, flavor, and market appeal. Aquaculture encompasses various water systems, including freshwater, brackish water, and marine environments, as well as plant-based items like Sea-chi, sea-beet kraut, and seaweed kimchi. Genetic variation, food supply security, population growth, and technological advances are key factors fueling this trend. Inland fish production, high-protein diets, and various restaurant sectors, from full-service to quick-service, are major consumers. However, environmental concerns, such as water pollution and the impact on biodiversity, necessitate careful consideration. Aquaculture species range from freshwater fish like tench and carps, to marine species such as sea bream, pompano, snappers, groupers, milkfish, tuna, and various exotic species like eels, lionfish, rays, and sharks. Research report provides comprehensive data on impact of trend, driver and challenges - The aquaculture market encompasses a diverse range of species and products, including Sea bass, Octopus, Prawns, and various Marine fish species. This sector extends beyond fin fishes to incorporate Seals, Dolphins, and Turtles, which are primarily used for their luxurious by-products, such as fur and leather. Omega-3 fatty acids, a key health benefit derived from aquatic animals, further bolsters the market's growth. Aquaculture is practiced through various farming techniques, such as rearing processes for fin fishes like carp and mollusks, such as crabs.

The changing lifestyles and working population's increasing demand for seafood have fueled the market's growth. Aquatic animals, including fin fishes and mollusks, are essential sources of livelihood for numerous growers. Production methods, time, and production efficiency are crucial factors in ensuring the sustainability and profitability of aquaculture. Fishing techniques have evolved to include stocking, feeding, and selective breeding to optimize productivity. The market caters to various segments, including finfish generics and fish reproduction, to meet the diverse demands of consumers. Overall, the aquaculture industry continues to expand, driven by the potential for innovation and the growing importance of sustainable, efficient, and high-quality aquatic food production. For more information on market segmentation with geographical analysis including forecast (2024-2028) and historic data (2017-2021) - The global Aquaculture Market is experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for seafood, particularly fin fishes such as carp and salmon, mollusks like oysters and clams, and crustaceans including crabs. This demand is driven by the nutritional benefits of fish, which are rich sources of protein, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients. With population growth and technological advances, there is a greater focus on sustainable aquaculture practices, including the use of cultivable land and aquatic animals like seaweed for production.

        "description": "The Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East.",
        "content": "The Nets were a top-six seed in the Eastern Conference in 2022-23, but that was largely due to the work of a pre-trade-deadline roster led by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving . After trading away Irving on Feb. 6 (an injured Durant was moved three days later), the team went 13-17 down the stretch and was swept out of the playoffs in the first round by Philadelphia. Those second-half and postseason results accurately reflected the level of the new-look roster, which underwent only marginal changes during the 2023 offseason. So it came as no real surprise that after hovering around .500 for much of the first half of this past season, Brooklyn eventually fell out of play-in contention, even in a weak Eastern Conference where the No. 10 seed finished with 36 wins. The team’s 32-50 record in 2023-24 wasn’t far off from its pace to finish the previous season. While the Nets have some talented young players on their roster, none appear to be on a fast track to superstardom, so roster changes will be necessary to increase the team’s ceiling. But there’s no simple path to legitimate upgrades — Brooklyn is capped out this summer and doesn’t own a 2024 draft pick. Going in the other direction and bottoming out in the hopes of landing a future star in the 2025 or 2026 draft isn’t really a viable path either, since the Nets don’t control their own first-round draft pick until 2028. As a result of the 2021 trade for James Harden , Brooklyn owes the Rockets its unprotected first-rounder in both 2024 (No. 3 overall) and 2026, along with swap rights in 2025 and 2027. The situation isn’t quite as dire as it was for a few years in Brooklyn after the team’s misguided decision to mortgage several years of draft assets in a deal for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, which lined up the Celtics to draft Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in consecutive years. But the Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East. The Nets’ Offseason Plan Mikal Bridges is the best player – and asset – on the Nets’ roster, but he was miscast as a No. 1 option in 2023-24. His play declined in the second half, and while he’d never ask for a night off (he hasn’t missed a single game since entering the league in 2018), the veteran forward probably wouldn’t mind facing a little less defensive attention going forward. Bridges averaged just 15.7 points per game on 39.9% shooting in his final 31 games of the season. Bridges makes perfect sense as the second or third option on a contending team, slotting into a role like the one OG Anunoby played for the Knicks — he can make three-pointers and handle challenging defensive assignments, but he’s better off as a secondary scorer, not as someone who constantly has the ball in his hands. Whether Bridges ends up in a more appropriate role in Brooklyn or elsewhere is the question. As noted above, the Nets don’t have cap room or draft picks this summer, so the only way to turn Bridges into their No. 2 option in 2024-25 would be to trade for a star. That scenario isn’t out of the question. Despite not controlling their own draft picks in the coming years, the Nets have an excess of future assets from other teams — namely Dallas and Phoenix — as a result of last year’s Irving and Durant trades. They also have a huge salary-matching piece in Ben Simmons , who will make $40.3M on an expiring contract in 2024-25. Brooklyn has frequently been linked to Donovan Mitchell and could certainly be a player in the bidding for the Cavaliers guard or another star who hits the trade market this summer. I’d question whether that’s the right approach though. Mitchell – or an equivalent star – would certainly make the Nets a better team, but he wouldn’t make them a legitimate title contender, and the cost (not only in trade assets but in the form of a long-term maximum-salary contract for the incoming star) would limit the club’s ability to pursue further upgrades. Team owner Joe Tsai recently talked about taking a “longer-term approach” to team-building, and the hiring of a player development specialist like Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn’s new head coach suggests the organization isn’t looking to take big swings after a 32-50 season unless a can’t-miss opportunity falls into its lap. I’d be surprised if the Nets make a blockbuster win-now deal this offseason — it makes more sense to build up the roster patiently and incrementally like they did the last time they went through a retooling process without their own draft picks. Of course, there is another potential route available to the Nets: Bridges would have significant value on the trade market. Head of basketball operations Sean Marks and his front office have been adamantly opposed to trading Bridges despite reportedly receiving strong offers ever since they acquired him last February, and I understand that stance. His skill set is a coveted one and he’s proven he can play big minutes on a championship contender, having been a full-time starter for the Suns team that got within two wins of a title in 2021. You don’t want to trade that sort of player. Plus, as we noted earlier, making next year’s roster even worse wouldn’t benefit the Nets from a draft perspective as long as they don’t control their picks. But what if they did control their picks? The Rockets, who have prioritized two-way players since Ime Udoka‘s arrival last spring, reportedly covet Bridges and were said to be prepared to put a strong offer on the table for him at February’s trade deadline. Could it be in the Nets’ best interest, long-term, to consider a Bridges deal with Houston that would return their own 2026 pick and eliminate those 2025 and 2027 swap rights? Even if this year’s No. 3 pick isn’t included in the package (it could be), regaining control of those future picks would put Brooklyn in position to properly rebuild with valuable lottery picks in the next year or two. They could take the rebuild a step further by also entertaining trade offers for wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Cameron Johnson , both of whom would hold real appeal for playoff teams. There’s no simple answer here for the Nets. While negotiating with the Rockets makes some sense on the surface, Houston would presumably recognize that Brooklyn’s own first-round picks are more valuable to the Nets than another team’s first-rounders would be, which would give the Rockets added leverage in any trade talks. And is Marks’ job security strong enough — after he was given the chance to hire his fourth head coach this spring — that he’d be willing to take another step backward by hitting the reset button again? I’m skeptical, which is why I consider Bridges more likely than not to open the 2024-25 season as a Net. The decisions the Nets make on the trade market could have a huge impact on the franchise, but the front office has the option of simply taking a wait-and-see approach on that front. That’s not the case in free agency, where starting center Nic Claxton will become an unrestricted free agent this summer, giving him the ability to leave Brooklyn without the team getting any compensation. The Nets will do all they can to avoid that happening, which might mean going up to $25M per year — or even a little higher — to retain the young big man, who has emerged as a reliable rim protector and rebounder up front and still might have his best years ahead of him. Fernandez and Marks didn’t do themselves any favors in their upcoming negotiations with the 25-year-old by declaring last month that they believe he’s a future Defensive Player of the Year, but he would’ve been in line for a major payday anyway. For what it’s worth, Jarrett Allen signed a five-year, $100M free agent contract back in 2021 when his résumé wasn’t all that dissimilar to Claxton’s and a $20M salary represented about 17.8% of the cap. Three years later, 17.8% of the projected 2024-25 cap would be almost exactly $25M. The Nets will also have contract decisions to make on Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe , though there’s less urgency in those cases — both Thomas and Sharpe are extension-eligible beginning this July, but would be on track for restricted free agency in 2025 if no deal is reached before the 2024-25 regular season begins. As long as Brooklyn is able to re-sign Claxton, I wouldn’t count on a new deal for Sharpe this offseason. Big man Noah Clowney flashed real promise toward the end of his rookie season, and if he continues to improve, he could push Sharpe for the role of Claxton’s primary backup next season. The Nets may want to see more from both players before deciding in 2025 whether to invest long-term in Sharpe. Thomas is a trickier case. He’s a genuinely gifted scorer, having racked up 22.5 points per game in his third NBA season, but he doesn’t do much else on offense and has been a subpar defender. His ability to put the ball in the basket is valuable, but Brooklyn will likely be reluctant to break the bank on a player whose game outside of that one skill is so limited. It wouldn’t surprise me if the two sides have a hard time bridging the gap between the contract the Nets are comfortable offering and the one Thomas will seek. It’s also worth noting that if the Nets simply keep Simmons’ expiring contract on their books for the 2024-25 season and don’t add any long-term money to their cap besides Claxton, they’ll be well-positioned to create real financial flexibility a year from now, when Simmons’ $40M+ and Dennis Schröder ‘s $13M contract end. Locking up Thomas early would cut into that room, assuming his next deal starts above his projected 2025 cap hold of $12.1M. That’s another argument in favor of holding off on a new deal for the 22-year-old until next year. Salary Cap Situation Guaranteed Salary Ben Simmons ($40,338,144) Cameron Johnson ($23,625,000) Johnson’s cap hit includes a $22,500,000 base salary and $1,125,000 in likely incentives.

        "content": "The first “Golden Dragon 2024” exercise between the Cambodian and Chinese navies ended yesterday, while the sixth army exercises will end on Thursday. Major General Thong Solimo, Deputy Director of Information and Communication at the General Command and spokesman for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), said yesterday that “The exercise for the navies was completed yesterday, while the exercise for the two armies is scheduled to end on Thursday.” “On the final day of the Golden Dragon 2024 exercise both troops will hold a a grand finale at the Military Police Training Centre in Samakki Meanchey district in Kampong Chhnang province,” he said. “The exercise is aimed at exchanging experiences, maintaining cooperation, increasing trust, and further developing the relations between the two armies and navies,” he said. The remarks were made during the closing ceremony of the naval exercise which was presided over by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF and Chairman of the Exercise Committees with China General Ith Sarath and Major General Gao Xiucheng, Assistant Chief of Staff of Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theatre Command, at Ream Naval Base in Preah Sihanouk province yesterday. Maj Gen Solimo, said that Gen Sarath emphasised that the current naval exercises were not a threat to any country, and that it aimed to exchange experiences between the two navies in order to increase the capacity of both and combat terrorism on the sea. According to Maj Gen Solimo, Gen Sarath also gave instructions to the Cambodian and Chinese navies to continue to pay attention to cooperation in all fields and exchange experiences with each other to increase professional skills and gain knowledge on military technology. Gen Sarath said the two sides must continue to promote solidarity, friendship, and strategic cooperation between the leaders of both countries, adding that the two armies set out to build common cooperation and a common destiny. A statement from the Chinese National Defence Ministry said on Saturday that the Chinese troops participating in the China-Cambodia “Golden Dragon 2024” joint exercise dispatched a medical unit to carry out free health treatment at a local health centre in Kampong Chhnang province on Wednesday last week. The Chinese medical unit consisted of 20 medical staff members, including nine specialists in orthopedics and endocrinology. On Wednesday morning, the team treated more than 300 locals with on-site diagnosis and treatment, and distributed more than 500 boxes of medicines, it said. The Chinese troops visited a local school and donated educational material to the teachers and students on May 20, it said. “These two charitable activities were an important part of the joint exercise, aiming to further enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries,” the statement added. Thong Mengdavid, Geopolitical Analyst and Lecturer at the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy (IISPP) at the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), said yesterday that the joint Cambodian-Chinese naval exercise is aimed at expanding military cooperation between the two navies, as well as increasing preparedness to maintain order, stability, and security of maritime space in the region. The exercise will promote the exchange of information and experience, the development of skills and training for both troops, as well as the testing and sharing of new technologies with each other, he said. “During the context of international security and the rise of transnational crime in the region, Cambodia has always focused on maintaining security and regional order,” he said. “Cambodia is always involved in international security cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations and under the framework of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well,” Mengdavid added. The army drills are taking place over a 15-day period, and for the navies, over 12 days. They involve over 2,000 Cambodian and 760 Chinese soldiers, and feature a variety of military hardware, including 14 warships, helicopters, robotic dogs, and armoured vehicles.",

        "description": "Quebec provincial police confirmed they're investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling.",
        "content": "Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme For Thé in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,” he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. Story continues below advertisement “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. 2:29 Health Matters: CFIA steps us avian influenza surveillance Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Story continues below advertisement Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he’ll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said.

        "content": "Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich has attended several different schools and said she has been exposed to diverse cultures along the way. Russ Dillingham/Sun Journal TURNER — Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich, 18, has the kind of perseverance and determination that inspires others around her, Principal Eben Shaw said. An engaged member of the high school and community, she helped raise money for local youth athletics by selling clothes donated to her and donating the leftovers to local clothes closets, he said. It is one example of the ways she has affected her community. “She’s been a great student here at Leavitt and I have no doubt she will be equally impactful at Colby next year,” he said. Attending several different schools, Rusakovich said she has learned there is a much larger world or different cultures and ways of life beyond where one attends schools or the town they are raised in. “I will always be grateful for these schools teaching me different ways of life, being exposed to different cultures and diversity, but for also teaching me how to advocate for myself in an unfamiliar place — finding my independence,” she said. Best part of each day? The best part of each day is being able to talk to my biggest support system here at Leavitt. The teachers, whether it be lunch talks or just saying hi in the hallways, and the relationships I have built with teachers here have brightened my worst days at school. Worst part of each day? I think the worst part of each day is being in those particular classes with students who don’t care about their education. It’s hard to see the contrasting classes of honors to regular and the disrespect many teachers have to endure. When kids start to disrespect the learning of other students because they don’t want to learn, it’s hard to find motivation to perform in those classes. Favorite class or subject? Why? My favorite classes/subjects throughout school have been literature and government. In these classes, you have the freedom to think individually, critique, analyze, and form your own conclusions. In typical math and science classes, there is one answer and one answer only, whereas in government and literature, you have moments in class to talk and debate with your classmates, to form your conclusion on an idea or theme. I just love that freedom of thought and not having to be perfect all the time. I never knew I would find such a passion for government since so many aspects within government have made me upset but I have found a huge passion for learning about government so that I can properly defend myself and hopefully one day advocate for others, through better knowledge of government ideals. Favorite teacher or school staff member? Why? The teachers who have made the biggest impact on my adjustment here at Leavitt are Mrs. Marcotte, Mr. Cifelli, Mrs. Talbot and Mr. Strong. These teachers have given me a sense of community, understanding and support. With everything I have been through in the past few years, I can always count on Marcotte or Cifelli to talk to and support me. Strong and Talbot offer a safe space for me to talk but also to make mistakes without feeling guilty. Their classrooms have become places where I may have struggled but I could see myself grow in my time there and my time getting to know them. These teachers will be the teachers I remember for a lifetime with how much they have helped me to open up. What was the hardest part of high school and how did you find your way through it? The hardest part about high school was the feeling of loneliness. Moving to three new schools, one of which being in a new state with 2,000 kids, it is easy to just be swallowed up by the crowd. Or moving to a small school where everyone has grown up together, meaning you’ll never really be accepted. One year leaves no time for you to truly find your place and leave a mark at a school. The hardest conclusion I had to come to was that I couldn’t rely on anybody anymore and at times I only had myself and I had to advocate to have my voice heard. Though, it has been a really good experience to learn more about myself as well as find my voice and be a little louder. And although it’s hard to find your people when moving, once you do find that select group, it’s worth it. How do you think you’ll be remembered by the members of your class? I’m not sure how I will be remembered at Leavitt or in my class but I have been told many times that I have made a huge impact at Leavitt for the better and that is my only goal in life, to make a difference and make someone’s life better. I think I have accomplished this by starting an outing club, raising awareness about sustainability and just trying to spread positivity. However, I don’t want people to remember me for these things that I did, I’d rather have them remember what they learned from those things and hopefully carry on the difference I may have made. Something you wish teachers and administrators understood about students today? Something I wish teachers and administrators knew about students today is that life is hard for everyone out there right now. Although this older generation believes that our generation is weak, we have to endure so many more things that affect our mental health differently, social media being a huge factor. I also believe that students nowadays are held to such high expectations and it is engraved into our minds that we are failures if we make one mistake. Everyone is going through something and we all handle it differently. So just be aware, be understanding, and help kids succeed rather than trying to fail kids. If I didn’t have those teachers to see my full character through a lot of tough times at home, I wouldn’t be where I am now. Some kids just need to feel understood in this craziness of the world nowadays. Advice to all those eighth graders entering high school next year? One piece of advice I have for freshman next year, and honestly anybody at Leavitt. Don’t conform to the crowd. Find yourself, find what you stand for and don’t settle for anything that makes you less than happy. Something I notice with incoming freshmen is that it is almost forced upon everyone to join a sport or a club. You don’t need to conform to the very few sports or clubs here at Leavitt. If you have other hobbies or interests, pursue those instead of devoting time to something you don’t love. Start a club of your interest! I wish I attended Leavitt longer to get more people involved in our outing club. Just do what makes you happy, not what makes other people happy. If I never took my own initiative and only listened to others I wouldn’t be where I am today. I still have regrets about passions I never pursued and opportunities I lost, so never let expectations or people hold you back. What is next for you after graduation? My plan after high school is to attend Colby College and pursue Environmental Policy and Government. I want to make a difference in the world and help advocate for basic human rights and the environment.

        "description": "Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a “tragic mistake” and that Israel was investigating. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that “despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy's SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "The boohoo share price has seen a rocky few years, but with signs that the economy is improving, could this be a buying opportunity?The post Potentially 34% undervalued, should I be watching the boohoo share price? appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.",
        "content": "( ), the online fashion giant known for its trendy styles and targeted marketing, has experienced a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Once a darling of the stock market, the boohoo share price has plummeted over 20% in the last year alone. But is this a sign of a sinking ship, or a buying opportunity for savvy investors? What’s going on? Analysts are divided. While the company has undoubtedly faced challenges, some see reasons to make this a stock well worth watching. boohoo’s recent woes can be attributed to a confluence of factors. In November 2023, the company issued a profit warning, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and rising costs. The primary demographic, young adults aged 16 to 45, were reportedly feeling the pinch of inflation and were cutting back on discretionary spending like clothing. Furthermore, the fast-fashion industry itself has seen some other major headwinds in recent years. Consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious and are shifting towards sustainable clothing options, away from fast fashion. Boohoo’s business model, built on mass production of trendy garments at low costs, might not resonate as strongly with this new wave of eco-conscious shoppers. As a result, the share price has plummeted over 85% in the last five years. Signs of hope Despite the current gloom, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Firstly, analysts predict annual earnings growth of a whopping 80% over the coming years. Admittedly, there still aren’t any signs of profit for the foreseeable, but a long-term investor may be rewarded if this trend can continue. Secondly, the company is adept at using social media and influencer marketing to reach its target audience. In the ever-evolving retail landscape, this could be a massive growth area. The third, and most interesting factor to me is the potential valuation. A calculation suggests the firm is about 34% undervalued. Although this isn’t a guarantee, with this much potential, I’d consider some more digging into the well worth doing. At present, debt levels seem to be under control. Also, there is a solid reserve of cash available, but as the sector has seen in the past, such resources can disappear very quickly in the wrong environment. Risks remain Before jumping on the bandwagon, it’s important to acknowledge there are still plenty of concerns that have dogged the company in recent years. There have been accusations of poor working conditions in its supply chain. These controversies can damage the firm’s reputation and seriously alienate consumers who value ethical practices. Moreover, boohoo faces stiff competition from established players like and emerging rivals like PrettyLittleThing. The online fashion market is crowded, and boohoo will need to innovate and adapt to stay ahead of the curve. Am I buying? The potential upside in the boohoo share price is certainly enticing. But it’s important to remember that this is just a calculation, and the stock price could easily go down further. For long-term investors who believe in the firm’s ability to overcome its challenges and adapt to the changing retail landscape, then the current share price might be an attractive entry point. However, I still don’t have much confidence that these can be resolved any time soon. I’ll be staying well clear for now.",

The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "description": "Turkish capital hosts ‘Hamas festival,’ with clerics and political leaders praising the October 7 massacre and openly expressing anti-Jewish bigotry.",
        "content": "Sami Al-Arian, an academic deported from the US a couple of decades ago after pleading guilty to providing services to the (PIJ), shared a stage in a panel discussion with a high-ranking member of the terror organization Hamas, Jamal Issa, during a conference held in Istanbul last week. The conference was titled “The Flood of the Free” as a homage to Hamas’s October 7 massacre, named by the radical terror group “Flood of Al-Aqsa,” with the conference logo featuring two paragliders referring to the terrorists who on their bloodthirsty quest to murder, rape and kidnap over 1200 Israelis and foreigners on October 7. Other also took part in other sessions during the two-day event, including Osama Hamdan, Sami Abu Zuhri, as well as Khaled Meshaal, who sent a pre-recorded blessing to the conference. The main host of the event was the Global Campaign to Support Al-Quds and Palestine (GCQP), an Istanbul-based organization pertaining to the Muslim Brotherhood axis, with close organizational and ideological ties to the Al-Quds Foundation, designated as a Hamas proxy by both the US and Israel. Other hosts included Turkish NGO “Human and Civilization Movement,” as well as the Al-Baraka Society, a charity organization led by Algerian Muslim Brotherhood cleric Ahmed Brahimi. According to the organizers, the conference saw participation of hundreds of people from dozens of countries, from Pakistan to Yemen to Morocco. Several speakers in the conference expressed openly antisemitic views, including Mohammad Ibrahim, preacher at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, who denounced “the Jews among the Arabs” and pointed at the Talmud as a motivation for the “burning of Gaza;” as well as Iraqi Sheikh Waleed Al-Husseini who praised Iraq’s struggle “against the Jews” ever since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, also praising the missiles shot by Saddam Hussein at Israel during the first Gulf War. Likewise, former justice minister of Mauritius, Rama Valayden, claimed that Israel “only understands the language of money,” calling to boycott international firms such as McDonald's, KFC, Coca-Cola, and even Head & Shoulders, alleging that they “support the Israeli army and Netanyahu.” A similar event was held one day later, as another Istanbul-based Islamist organization named the Palestine Scholars Association (PSA) held a conference titled “The Nation's Religious Scholars and the Flood of the Free,” which saw the participation of Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk. Notedly, PSA itself is led by Nawaf Takrouri, named a member of Hamas’s founding generation, who was deported by Israel in 1993 on the backdrop of his ties to the radical terror organization. The event saw participation of Muslim Brotherhood-oriented Islamist clerics from different countries. During the event, Abu Marzouk praised “mosques, the Quran, and Jihad” as the three reasons behind “Gaza’s triumph,” adding that “Jihad is not limited to weapons, but rather jihad is an obligation in our day, each in his specialty, work, and place.” According to Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated channels, the conference concluded with ten suggestions for action among scholars as part of the efforts to “support the flood [of Al-Aqsa],” including strengthening jihadi education, applying pressure on governments, enhancing Da’wah (‘call to Islam’ or religious preaching) through online platforms for the youth, and spreading “Qur’anic messages related to victory and love for Al-Aqsa.” Other suggestions included learning from Hamas, whose model was initiated by an Islamist religious scholar, supporting Palestinians in arenas involved in combating Israel, reviving jurisprudence of jihad and jihadi education while “drawing inspiration from the positions of our people’s jihad in Gaza and Palestine,” and promoting economic boycott of “the enemy.” Türkiye has long been a staunch supporter of Hamas, hosting the terror group’s leaders on many occasions and providing material and moral support to the radical Islamist group. Both Erdogan’s AKP party and the Palestinian terror organization have their ideological roots in what is named “political Islam” or Islamism, led worldwide by the Muslim Brotherhood axis. This ideology, amplified and promoted by religious institutions, political parties, and NGOs across the globe and usually backed by Qatar and Türkiye, aspires to establish its own version of Islam as the main focal point of personal and political identities. The Muslim Brotherhood is also the ideological predecessor of Salafi Jihadist movements such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and many scholars attribute the movement with the trickling of classical European antisemitic tropes into the Arab and Islamic sphere. through translations and adaptations of antisemitic texts.",

        "content": "BEMIDJI — Despite a steady drizzle, around a hundred community members gathered together on Monday morning at Greenwood Cemetery for a Memorial Day ceremony to honor those who have died while serving their country. After the presentation of the colors by members of the Honor Guard and junior ROTC, Ralph Gracie American Legion Post No. 14 Commander Steve Jewett led attendees in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Past Commander Joe Vene then sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before a POW flag was posted in honor of the many prisoners of war and those unaccounted for in all wars and conflicts involving the United States. \"Father, we're gathered here together to honor the memory of those who served and those who gave their lives in the line of duty,\" Chaplain Ken Glidden said during an opening prayer. \"Father, we thank you for their service. Help us to always remember and live our lives accordingly so that we, too, may dedicate ourselves toward the calling that we had.\" Jewett welcomed attendees to the service before introducing guest speaker, and and host of \"Lakeland Currents\" on Lakeland PBS. Haugen shared the history of Memorial Day, which was originally established as Decoration Day on May 30, 1868, to honor the over 600,000 casualties in the American Civil War. The holiday became Memorial Day in 1971 and was expanded to include American soldiers killed in every war. \"We have many holidays that are celebrations, though to me, Memorial Day is not one of them,\" Haugen said. \"Every one of those Americans killed in battle would have loved to live out their life in the happiness of the freedom that we enjoy that they, and our other veterans, made possible. \"Knowing that so many of them had to die to make that possible doesn't make me want to celebrate, but it does make me want to honor them and their memory in any way I can.\" Haugen spoke about his father's service in the military as a highly decorated Marine who led a squadron of bomber pilots in the Philippines in World War II. \"Some of our veterans die from their battle wounds many years after the end of their military service,\" Haugen explained. \"Such was the case with my dad.\" His father is one of many veterans no longer living who made great sacrifices for their country. After a relapse of malaria contracted in the Philippines, he died by suicide in 1965 when Haugen was 7 years old. Haugen ended his speech with a call for attendees to remember and honor the service of veterans killed in battle every day, not just on Memorial Day. \"Let's keep in mind all of our veterans who are no longer with us,\" Haugen said. \"There would be no United States of America without veterans' service, living or not. ... I'm sure that they would want to know that they, and their sacrifice, are remembered.\" Following Haugen's address, Glidden read off a list of Ralph Gracie members who have died in the last year. Auxiliary member Kathy Ramos then read a list of those from Bemidji who died in action in the Korean War. The initial part of the program closed with a rifle salute, Bemidji High School trumpet players Ryan Maki and Braeden Dougherty playing \"Taps,\" and Joe Vene singing \"America the Beautiful.\" To wrap up the service, everyone moved to the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial to honor those who died during the Civil War with a rifle salute, reading of the Gettysburg Address and playing of \"Taps.\"",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.

        "content": "(iStock / Getty Images) Q : More than a decade ago, I used to work on the same team as “Brad,” who pursued me romantically. I was initially not interested, but after two years we started dating. Then, after a few weeks, he ghosted me. It was messy and painful, because I was young and very much in love. I sent him two texts calling him a lying jerk, but in harsher terms. Our manager said I was hurting the team dynamic and transferred me to a different office in the same city. I was happy to go. I cringe just thinking about how immature and unprofessional my actions were after the breakup. Also on our team was Abby, a toxic person who seeks out drama and creates conflict everywhere she goes. In the three months we worked together, Abby created workplace issues with two other people. She was also throwing herself at Brad. It was so obvious that her boyfriend broke up with her over it. I am now happily married and work for a different company thousands of miles away. My company recently hired Abby. She has been asking people if I’ve been “harassing any men,” and then retelling everything that happened. I was always friendly and professional with Abby, so it’s not like she has a grudge against me. How should I handle this? Do I ignore it and hope it dies down? Do I go to HR? Do I tell people she didn’t come out of it smelling like roses either? Do I look for a new job? I’m just so tired. A: I’ll take you at your word that this was a one-time, sorely regretted incident when your youth and emotions overrode your professionalism, and you learned the hard way about love bombing. (I might even argue that the person truly responsible for hurting the team dynamic was the one who spent two years badgering a teammate into a relationship, but that’s not helpful now.) Ordinarily, I’d tell you that people will catch on quickly that Abby is a drama-feeding muckraker, and you can safely ride out the gossip cycle by sticking to the high road. But her language takes things well beyond dishing about a messy breakup. If she’s falsely insinuating that you have a history of harassing men in general, that’s potentially harmful to your reputation, depending on how credulous and cutthroat your colleagues are. You need to get ahead of that narrative as soon as possible. Cornering her in the bathroom is tempting, but inadvisable. Asking if she’s heard from her ex recently, as a coded way of letting her know you also keep receipts, would probably be too subtle a hint to burst her soap-opera bubble. Also, bear in mind George Bernard Shaw’s adage about wrestling with swine in their own element: You’ll both get dirty, and she’ll like it. Instead, you would be best served by bringing the problem to a third-party authority who can intervene, whether that’s your manager or your HR department. Give your drama-free synopsis: “Ten years ago, in another job, I was briefly romantically involved with a co-worker. It ended badly, and I regret the experience and have never repeated that mistake.” If pressed for more details, keep it brief but honest: “When he abruptly ended things, I was hurt and sent him a couple of rude texts.” Subtext: You were unprofessional, but not violent or dangerous. You accepted the consequences and moved on. Then outline the problem and your request: “Unfortunately, someone who worked with me back then is now spreading embarrassing and embellished stories about that time. I’m concerned her narrative is undermining me and hurting my reputation, and I would like it to stop.” If your company has a general policy against bullying - including, for example, spreading rumors or gossip intended to humiliate - this would be the time to spell out how you believe Abby is violating it. You might be counseled to go back and discuss the matter with Abby yourself. But getting it on the record with HR first may be useful if Abby ups her game to more blatant harassment or starts creating trouble for other colleagues. Otherwise, should any co-workers care enough to inquire about your past, you can simultaneously own and defuse the intrigue with an eye-roll: “Yeah, that’s when I learned firsthand why dating a co-worker is a bad idea.” Assuming your colleagues know you as a mature, levelheaded professional, they will soon see Abby’s hot gossip for the cold tea it is. They will realize, as you should, that this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her.",

The exact recovery period for the 33-year-old has not yet been disclosed, but the player himself has confirmed that the Euros will come too soon. “I can’t imagine I’ve had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn’t play the final, win the Europa League. In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff but it turns out I can’t play the Euros,” De Roon wrote in an post on “I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it’s a very tough day.

        "content": "Brits face being lashed by yet more storms following a washout Bank Holiday. After mixed bag of weather over the weekend, forecasts show more patches of storms across parts of the country in the coming hours. Tuesday and Wednesday's weather maps show huge patches of rain, thunder and lightning - particularly for parts of the North and Scotland . Liverpool is set to see the worst of Tuesday's deluge, with up to 2mm of rain to fall per hour across Merseyside, according to data from Ventusky. Cumbria, Isle of Man, Humberside and Lincolnshire, South West Scotland and North Wales will all see storms on Tuesday, according to the forecast. Wednesday will bring further tempestuous weather for Merseyside, Greater Manchester and parts of Yorkshire and Cumbria, according to the Ventusky maps. Earlier on Monday, the Met Office issued an 11-hour warning for thunderstorms and heavy showers. I'm a beauty lover and swear by these 6 Urban Decay products I've used for years Ventusky maps have revealed exactly which parts of the country face storms and a deluge Low pressure systems have brought spells of wet weather across the country, and the rain shows no signs of abating throughout the week. The yellow warning is in place from 11am on Monday until 10pm, reading: “Slow moving heavy showers and thunderstorms may cause flooding and disruption in places.” BBC weather forecaster Tomasz Schafernaker said the weather would continue to be \"hit and miss\" throughout the week. \"Further showers are expected not just on Bank Holiday Monday but indeed the rest of the week,\" said the presenter. \"Temperatures will be normal, nothing spectacular but at least by the end of the week it does look as though these low pressures should finally pull away as we see high pressure building but the winds will still come in from the north so the certainly isn’t any major warm up in the forecast.” Met Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris warned of localised flooding for Scotland and northeast England but there could be drier weather in the west. He said: “The outlook for Bank Holiday Monday is for brighter, cooler and breezier conditions with scattered showers for England and Wales at first, but a steady drying trend from the west is likely. \"Northern Ireland could well start off fine but cool, and remain settled whilst feeling pleasantly warm in longer sunny spells. The focus for heavier showers is expected to transfer to Scotland and possibly northeast England, where again these could be slow moving, the heaviest of which could cause some temporary, localised issues such as flooded roads.\"",

        "content": "Controversial musician, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has declared himself police ambassador a few days after causing a stir while evading arrest by police officers. Portable made this known in a post on his Instagram page, where he shared photos of himself with his father and other high-ranking officers in the Lagos police headquarters on Tuesday evening. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers at police headquarters in Lagos State. The Zazoo crooner regained his freedom the following day after being arrested for incurring a debt on the Mercedes Benz GLE he bought from a car dealer in Lagos. The singer further went to his social media page to explain what transpired between him and the car dealer, alleging that he had spent more than required on the vehicle because it was faulty. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers are at police headquarters in Lagos State. Meanwhile, reaffirming his relationship with the police, he announced that he is now a police ambassador while adopting the oft-used phrase – ‘Police is your friend’. He wrote, “ZAzuu Federal Government liability. Ọmọ ijoba Police Ambassador. I do music for a living ....Star don’t beg to shine. Akoi Grace Wey No Dey disgrace. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers are at police headquarters in Lagos State. “I no fit run from God that’s all my believing God is over everything after God na government Police is our friends I believe in God my phone and sub any disappointment is a blessing. ZEHNATION many many inspiration.” However, netizens have begun to praise the singer for always taking advantage of every opportunity, whether good or bad.

Produced by 2tuponthebeat, the song alludes to the singer’s flying power, referencing how he jumped over a gate to evade arrest. Portable The incident was captured in a video that circulated on Tuesday. The singer, dressed in a white and black stripe shirt, stood alongside eight other people and was seen climbing over a nearby gate before taking to his heels.",

        "content": "CARDIFF: England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler is likely to miss the third T20I of the four-match series against Pakistan, an international media outlet reported. According to the report, Buttler left for London after spearheading England to a comfortable 23-run victory over Pakistan in the second T20I in Birmingham. The England captain and his wife Louise are expecting the birth of their third child soon. Notably, Jos Buttler was absent from England’s training session in Cardiff on Monday afternoon and is unlikely to feature in the third T20I against Pakistan, scheduled on Tuesday evening. Moreover, it is uncertain whether Buttler will return in time for the final T20I against Pakistan but as things stand he is most likely to accompany the England squad on their departure for the West Indies for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 on Friday. Earlier, England’s vice-captain Moeen Ali, who has led the side in 12 ODIs and T20Is, stated that nothing will change if he assumes the England captaincy role in Jos Buttler’s absence. “I feel I’ve captained enough for England,” Moeen said. “I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much, it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. “For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. It’s not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team and all that. We’re on the same page anyway.” Pakistan squad: Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan. England squad: Jos Buttler (c), Phil Salt, Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Duckett, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Tom Hartley, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Reece Topley.

Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:22 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Edmonton Oilers' Adam Henrique (19) celebrates a goal against the Arizona Coyotes during NHL action in Edmonton on Friday April 12, 2024. The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "XDefiant’s Executive Producer, Mark Rubin, has confirmed that the much-coveted ping system is in development. The ping feature is common in online shooters, allowing players to effectively communicate with their teammates with just the press of a button. In Fortnite, the system is used for pointing out nearby enemies, highlighting loot, and marking the drop location in Battle Royale matches. Call of Duty: Warzone’s ping works similarly and also boasts a re-group setting that tells players when it’s time to rejoin their squadmates. To the surprise of many, without such a feature. The absence of a ping button has proven especially troublesome for players who can’t communicate with their team on a mic. However, according to XDefiant’s , developers are working on adding ping to the game. Rubin confirmed as much in a social media post on May 25, telling one curious player the following: “We have ping in the works.” Notably, progress on the feature hit a standstill because other elements of production were of a “higher priority” and, thus, demanded more manpower. “But hopefully we can get back to it once we get deeper into being live,” Rubin explained. When the feature will go live presently remains to be seen. The ping system is not the only highly-requested feature XDefiant developers are working on. In another post on May 25, Mark Rubin noted that in the future. Additionally, other developers have addressed complaints about . Repeated behaviors of this nature will eventually result in a penalty, though the specifics presently remain under lock and key.",

        "content": "By Nivedita Balu and Fergal Smith TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada, Mexico and Argentina on Monday started to settle securities trades faster, halving settlement time to one day, in a move designed to reduce counterparty risk and improve market liquidity. Settlement is the final stage of a trade, when buyers get their securities delivered and sellers are paid. Market participants and regulators in the United States are paying close attention to the implementation of the so-called T+1 in Canada, Mexico and Argentina because Wall Street will shift to one-day settlement on Tuesday for equities, corporate and municipal bonds and other securities. As global markets are highly integrated, any hiccups there could signalize potential issues for the United States too. \"Everything is bright green at this point in time. There are no issues and everybody is extremely optimistic,\" said Keith Evans, executive director of the Canadian Capital Markets Association, a federally incorporated industry organization. Volumes will likely be up to 25% lighter than normal due to the U.S. holiday on Monday, making it \"somewhat of an advantage\" for Canada, Evans added. In Argentina, Gonzalo Pascual Merlo, chief executive of local exchange operator BYMA, told Reuters that the change would further strengthen the country's capital markets. \"Implementing this measure brings clear benefits for the whole ecosystem, from liquidity providers to investors and other participants,\" he said. A BYMA spokesman added that implementing the quicker settlement would \"strengthen the friction-less arbitrage with other global markets and reduce counterparty risk in normal settlement, increasing security for capital markets participants.\" Although regulators have been discussing the implementation of one-day settlement for a long time, it gained more traction after the 2021 trading frenzy around the \"meme stock\" GameStop (NYSE: GME ) highlighted the need to reduce counterparty risk and improve capital efficiency and liquidity in securities transactions. In China and India, the new standard is already in place, while Britain and the European Union plan to shift in the coming years. The more countries or markets adopt T+1, the more efficient the faster settlement it will be for global investors. Currency trades funding securities transactions currently settle in two days. Because of issues like this, regulators and market participants expect a temporary increase in trade fails. Research firm ValueExchange found in a survey that market participants expect the trade fail rate to increase to 4.1% after T+1 implementation from 2.9%. \"The next few days promise to be challenging,\" said Nawan Butt, head of capital markets at Purpose Investments in Toronto. \"We have to spend the time to handhold all trades and make sure trade fail rates remain low as funding costs are quite high with the current interest rate backdrop.\"",

Volumes will likely be up to 25% lighter than normal due to the U.S. holiday on Monday, making it \"somewhat of an advantage\" for Canada, Evans added. In Argentina, Gonzalo Pascual Merlo, chief executive of local exchange operator BYMA, told Reuters that the change would further strengthen the country's capital markets. \"Implementing this measure brings clear benefits for the whole ecosystem, from liquidity providers to investors and other participants,\" he said. A BYMA spokesman added that implementing the quicker settlement would \"strengthen the friction-less arbitrage with other global markets and reduce counterparty risk in normal settlement, increasing security for capital markets participants.\" Although regulators have been discussing the implementation of one-day settlement for a long time, it gained more traction after the 2021 trading frenzy around the \"meme stock\" GameStop (NYSE: GME ) highlighted the need to reduce counterparty risk and improve capital efficiency and liquidity in securities transactions. In China and India, the new standard is already in place, while Britain and the European Union plan to shift in the coming years. The more countries or markets adopt T+1, the more efficient the faster settlement it will be for global investors. Currency trades funding securities transactions currently settle in two days. Because of issues like this, regulators and market participants expect a temporary increase in trade fails. Research firm ValueExchange found in a survey that market participants expect the trade fail rate to increase to 4.1% after T+1 implementation from 2.9%. \"The next few days promise to be challenging,\" said Nawan Butt, head of capital markets at Purpose Investments in Toronto. \"We have to spend the time to handhold all trades and make sure trade fail rates remain low as funding costs are quite high with the current interest rate backdrop.\"",

        "content": "TALAMBAH: A shocking incident was reported from Tulamba area of Punjab where two orphan sisters were violently assaulted and had their fingers burned for allegedly stealing books from the madrasa, ARY News reported on Monday. The mother of the victim girls claimed accused that the individuals, named Mudassir and Maqsood along with others tortured her daughters, adding that the girls were taken to a tent, tied with ropes, and hung. She claims that the assailants later handed both her and the girls over to the police. “The police released me and my daughters on the guarantee of non-medical examination,” the mother claimed. The mother has accused the authorities of neglect and insists that a medical examination and justice for her daughters are necessary. She also stated that the girls have been barred from receiving any medical or psychological support following the trauma. DSP Saleem Rath confirmed that the girls were accused of stealing books from a madarssa and passing them to someone else. He mentioned that the incident occurred a few days ago and assured that he is currently investigating the case. DSP Rath promised a transparent inquiry, emphasizing that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDiscover how the three bargain stocks operating in oil and gas transportation and financial sectors can turbocharge the portfolio's growth.The post 3 Bargain Stocks Ready to Supercharge Your Wealth appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "One should look for hidden jewels in the stock market, which provide stability and development possibilities. Three businesses have stood out in this endeavor; each represents a different industry — banking, insurance and energy. They are all united by opportunity and perseverance. The first one excels in the energy field, namely in gas and oil transportation. Growing Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates indicate that geopolitical concerns and an aging tanker fleet have driven the company’s market performance. Meanwhile, the second one deftly negotiates the complex world of insurance. The company has maintained policyholders in the face of substantial premium hikes and enhanced the performance of its Property & Casualty (P&C) sector by implementing a methodical plan for profitability restoration. Finally, with strong financial indicators, the third one commands respect in regional banking. Strategic balance sheet expansion is the foundation for its strong performance, as seen by its earnings per share ( EPS ), return on equity and net interest income. Overall, these businesses offer more than just financial prospects. They are examples of resilience against volatile markets. Frontline (FRO) Frontline (NYSE: FRO ) has already secured 72% of Suezmax days at $52,800 per day, 69% of Aframax (LR2) days at an exceptional $67,800 per day, and 81% of Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) days at an average TCE cost of $55,100 per day for the first quarter of 2024 (in Q4 2023). These rising rates are load-to-discharge-based and the number of ballast days may impact them. Moreover, the tanker business is significantly affected ton-mile by the heightened tensions in the Middle East and the interruptions in the Red Sea/Aden area . Additionally, the United States is putting more pressure on Russia’s price cap evasions and the so-called Dark Fleet. Due to economies of scale, bigger boats such as VLCCs are preferred in the expanding trading lanes as non-OPEC oil output rises, especially from the U.S. and Brazil. Finally, with 133 VLCCs scheduled to reach 20 years old in 2024 alone, a sizable portion of the fleet’s current age is nearing or beyond 20. The Suezmax fleet has a comparable pattern. Thus, the aging fleet and rising ordering activity indicate a probable decrease in available tonnage, which might compress supply and justify higher prices. Horace Mann (HMN) Horace Mann ‘s (NYSE: HMN ) notable advancements in the P&C sector are one of its main advantages. Compared to Q1 2023, the P&C combined ratio increased by 13 points to 99.9% in Q1 2024. The combined ratio is the percentage of the premiums an insurer collects that it pays out in claims and expenses, before counting its profits from investing those premiums. This improvement shows that the segment’s cost control and efficiency have improved. The segment’s $11 million profit represented a substantial improvement over the previous year’s deficit and showed the value of the company’s multi-year profitability restoration plan. Additionally, Horace Mann projects overall premium increases in cars and property of around 40% and 50% , respectively, from 2022 to 2024. This calculated action aims to increase profitability. Further, the policyholder retention has stayed the same despite these significant premium hikes, indicating consumer loyalty and contentment with the value offered by the business. Thus, the steady retention rates in the face of increasing premiums demonstrate the efficacy of Horace Mann’s client retention techniques. Further, Q1 catastrophe losses were higher than the 10-year and five-year norms . However, they were less than 2023 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Overall, the resilience and effectiveness of the company’s claims management practices are demonstrated by its fundamental ability to manage higher catastrophic losses while increasing the consolidated bottom line. Columbia Banking System (COLB) Columbia Banking System (NASDAQ: COLB ) delivered operational EPS of $0.65 and $0.59 for Q1 2024. The company uses equity capital effectively, reflected in the operational return of 16% for tangible equity on average, reflecting its high returns to shareholders. Further, Q1’s net interest income of $423 million represented a $30 million decline from the prior quarter. This is mostly due to increased deposit expenses and decreased revenue from investment securities. Despite this drop, the net interest margin (NIM) was 3.52% , falling between the predicted range of 3.45% and 3.60%. Notably, price reductions on wholesale and promotional funding caused the NIM to rise to 3.55% in March. Thus, this demonstrates successful margin management in a challenging environment for interest rates. Lastly, for Q1, Columbia Banking System saw growth in deposits of $100 million and loans of $200 million. After declining in January, non-sparing demand deposits stabilized in February and March , indicating a stabilizing deposit base. Thus, it is evident that the company’s main strength that supports its expansion plan is its capacity to increase its balance sheet. As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in HMN and COLB. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

        "content": "American Ben Shelton won his first match at the French Open on Monday as he overcame Frenchman Hugo Gaston 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4, not only surviving two interruptions from the Paris rain but also the wrath of the local fans. Loud chants of \"Hugo, Hugo\" echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton's fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter. \"This was a pretty amazing atmosphere, honestly. This is the first time that I've come out to a tennis match and had a band playing in the stands on my court, so I think that was pretty special,\" Shelton told a press conference. \"I love these moments. I enjoy these atmospheres. I got a lot of heckling when I was in college tennis, but today the crowd was just loud, chanting, supporting their countryman. It's something that you love to see. There was a lot of positives out there,\" he added. The 21-year-old Shelton, who burst onto the scene last year when he reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park and the semis at the US Open, likened the atmosphere to an American football match and said he used to get booed at his college games. \"It's a big motivator when you hear the chants and cheers whenever you make an unforced error, but also, there was so much energy for me, which made it awesome,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's tough when it's completely silent when you hit a good shot, and they're going nuts every time that you miss, but here it was a little bit more even. Obviously, he had the home field advantage, but I felt some love out there,\" he added. Shelton will play Kei Nishikori, who beat Gabriel Diallo 7-5 7-6(3) 3-6 1-6 7-5, in the second round.

        "description": "A roundup of crime news from around the Lower Mainland and B.C. on Monday, May 27",
        "content": "Article content A North Vancouver man is facing charges after a knife-wielding man damaged several cars in Deep Cove over the weekend, then went after a motorcyclist with the weapon. North Vancouver RCMP were called about a man reportedly slashing cars near Deep Cove Road and Mount Seymour Parkway, not far from The Raven pub in the District of North Vancouver, at about 3 p.m. Saturday. “It is alleged the man was carrying a knife and using it to damage cars,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak in a news release on Monday. “The man then allegedly attacked a motorcyclist, striking his helmet with the knife, but fortunately, causing no injury. “The motorcyclist did sustain minor injuries as a result of falling, and was led to safety by a motorist at the scene.” Officers flooded the scene within minutes and arrested a suspect. Police allege the suspect assaulted an officer while in custody. North Van District Mayor Mike Little went to the scene on Saturday. “Deep Cove is a very safe area so this violent act comes as a complete shock,” said Little in a text exchange on Monday. “This could have been much more serious if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of a bystander who protected the victim in their car, and also thanks to the RCMP for their quick action.” On Sunday, prosecutors charged Alexander Currie with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault of a police officer and weapon possession. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Sahak. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passerby motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said the RCMP victim services unit is available 24/7 for anyone struggling emotionally by calling 604-969-7540. Witnesses who haven’t spoken to police are asked to call 604-985-1311. Richmond RCMP are hoping witnesses have dashcam footage after a traffic cop was forced to leap out of the way to avoid being hit by a speeding car last week. A road safety unit was cracking down on speeders on Highway 91 near the Knight Street Bridge on May 19 when an officer allegedly clocked a vehicle going 145 km/h in an 80 km zone. The officer on foot tried to stop the vehicle, but it didn’t stop and the Mountie had to dive to the side of the road to avoid getting hit. “Fortunately, our officer was not seriously injured, but this type of driving behaviour puts all road users at risk,” said Sgt. Eric Baskette of the road safety unit. Investigators are asking anyone who was in the area between 8:40 and 9:10 a.m. to check dashcam footage. The suspect was in a black sedan with a broken passenger-side mirror that was last seen headed east on Highway 91. Anyone with information or video is asked to call Richmond RCMP at 604-278-1212 or Crime Stoppers, 1-800-222-8477, or make a report at . A man wanted for assault and drug charges in Surrey and Langley who missed a court date in February is in custody. Surrey RCMP say Arandeep Gill, 34, failed to show up in court on Feb. 9 to face eight charges including assault and assault with a weapon. He was also wanted on three charges in Langley for possession of drugs for trafficking purposes and dangerous operation of a vehicle. Gill was arrested at a home in the 10400-block of University Drive late Sunday afternoon by Surrey RCMP, an integrated emergency response team, crisis negotiators, police dogs and a gang enforcement team. He is in custody until a remand hearing.",
