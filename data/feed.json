        "content": "A WOMAN has revealed that she makes Â£20,000 a month from a simple side hustle, that takes minutes to set up. Taylor Couch shared details of her money making hack via a video posted to her TikTok channel, which she often uses to share side hustle tips and tricks. The side hustle pro revealed that YouTube pays around Â£10-Â£20 per 1000 video views. She then explained that simple, faceless videos such as 'relaxing cafe music mix' or 'cosy fireplace sounds' gain around 60 million views on the video sharing platform. This means that the creators of these videos made over Â£230,000 from just one video. To make your own video, Taylor explained that all you need to do is go to ai.invideo.io. Then, ask the AI to make you a video, being as descriptive as possible. For example, Taylor asked the AI to create a three minute YouTube video with 10 scenes of beautiful scenery, paired with relaxing music. Then click 'generate video' and select your audience. \"Boom! Within minutes you have a video\", she said. You can then edit the video if you want to, and when you're happy with it, simply download it and upload it to YouTube. You can do this as many times as you like, creating a variety of different videos. \"Then sit back, and collect income passively\", she said. Taylor's video, which was posted under the username @thecouchclub , has likely left many people impressed, as it has racked up over 780,0000 views on the video sharing platform. TikTok users raced to the video's comments section to share their thoughts. One person said: \"Golden!! Thank you for sharing this!!\" A second person said: \"Thank you, helpful tips and ideas that I really appreciate. Based on new research from Finder, an estimated 22.8 million Brits are using side hustles to top up their income. Among generation those aged 18-23 68 percent have a side hustle in 2024. Those aged 24-42 arenât far behind, with 65 per cent having an additional source of income. Side hustles are less popular among older generations, with 40 percent of generation those aged 43-54 having one. Whereas 23 percent of people aged 55-73 and just 7 per cent of those aged 74 and over are earning extra cash this way. \"Definitely want to try this!\" A third person added: \"AI is really changing the game!!\" A fourth said: \"I love the way you can use AI to make money online\".

        "content": "SHE \"was sick\" of her greasy splashbacks that took off half the paint any time she tried to clean them. So, after getting inspiration from others online, Victoria decided to splash out on some stick on tiles from Temu to give her kitchen a revamp . She documented the process in a video on her TikTok page, as she admitted she was initially hesitant to buy from Temu after hearing mixed reviews. \"Would you believe that these stickers only cost me Â£16 from Temu?\" Victoria said. \"I've never bought from Temu before, and I thought it was gonna be a bit of a scam, but honestly this is so good. \"They actually look like real tiles - you cannot tell they're stickers!\" She initially showed where she'd tried to clean some of the grubbiness off her splashbacks, and it had taken the paint off. Victoria then showed the tile stickers she'd picked up, as she had been inspired by someone else who had bought the pink version. \"You simply peel back the plastic, and then you peel back the other bit for it to be sticky,\" she said, demonstrating as she went. \"I placed it on the wall like this - trust me it took me hours, but it's super easy. \"This is the final result and I am so chuffed with it!\" Victoria added in the caption: \"This isnt an ad, im so really happy with how these came out! \"You literally can't tell they are stickers!\" But the process wasn't entirely straightforward, as Victoria added: \"The cutting in around the plugs though was a REAL faff!\" \"I buy loads from there tbf,\" one person commented on the video. \"I've had some great stuff but prices have definitely gone up.\" \"Well if Â£16 is inflated I am sure gutted I missed them 'cheap',\" Victoria laughed. \"It doesnât look any different on camera unfortunately,\" someone else argued. Well Polished conducted a survey and the results are in! Most Hated Household Chores Most Liked Household Chores Men VS Women: Who Puts the Work In? Men spend 7 hours 54 minutes a week cleaning. Women spend 12 hours 15 minutes a week cleaning. \"I wish they were more defined!\" But Victoria was entirely unbothered by the remark, as she replied: \"That's okay! \"I don't look at it through a camera! \"And boy has it made a difference in real life!\"",

        "content": "Jonathan Kitchen Stock futures edged higher in the early trading hours of Tuesday, with Nasdaq Futures adding 0.5% to a session high after Appleâs China iPhone shipments rebounded. Here are some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers: Biggest stock gainers Shares of meme stock GameStop ( GME ) surged around 17% after the company announced the completion of a previously disclosed, roughly $933.4M equity offering through the sale of 45M shares. It intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments. The offering follows a recent spike in meme shares following the return of influential trader and analyst Keith Gill to social media. Gill, also known as âRoaring Kitty,â was an important figure in the 2021 meme-stock frenzy. CAVA Group's ( CAVA ) shares rose over 5% ahead of the company's Q results, scheduled after the market close, with analysts estimating EPS of $0.05 and the consensus revenue of $245.46M. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions, while revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 1 downward revision. Biggest stock losers Hello Group's ( MOMO ) shares fell nearly 6% after the company reported mixed Q1 results, with revenue dropping 9% Y/Y on the back of a decline in live video service revenues, Value-added service revenues, and Mobile games revenues. Monthly active users on the Tantan app fell to 13.7M, compared to 19.5M a year earlier, while Momo's total paying users were 7.1M in Q1, compared to 7.8M a year ago. The company also sees Q2 total net revenues between RMB2.65B and RMB2.75B, a decrease of 15.5% to 12.4% Y/Y.

While Asake and Seyi Vibez have not had any public spat, there has always been a chill between their fanbases, especially on social media. In a recent interview with The Beat FM Lagos, Ayra Starr was asked whether her decision to work with both men on her sophomore album, âThe Year I Turned 21,â was intentional because of their rivalry and she denied knowledge of the rivalry. According to her, she decided to work with them because she loves their sonic prowess. She said, âI didnât put Asake and Seyi Vibez on my album because of their rivalry. I didnât know about the rivalry between Asake and Seyi Vibez. I just love both of them as artists. âIâm really big on sonics; what would sound good sonically. My team is always thinking of the business side but Iâm just thinking of who would be sonically compatible with me. And Iâve been listening to Seyi Vibezâs âDifferent Patternâ for a very long time. So I decided to work with him. When I sent the record to him, he sent his verse almost immediately. They were very quick with it.

        "content": "Dear Readers : I appreciate it when people give me updates on previously published advice. Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I canât do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesnât know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldnât tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husbandâs attachment to his friend? Below is a Q&A originally published in 2016, and then the recent update. Dear Amy : Iâm hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise Iâm always drawing, painting and networking. From what Iâve learned, it takes years before most artists can quit their day jobs. Iâm prepared for this; Iâm in no way lazy, but I know it will take me a long time. I keep my head down and keep trying. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They donât understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: âJust go work for Disney,â or âNobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.â Or, âDo it for the exposure if you have to.â They donât trust that I know what Iâm doing, and they donât recognize how hard Iâm working. It gets to the point where I donât want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that Iâm not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? â Struggling Artist Dear Struggling : Everybodyâs an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more âexpertâ their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), âYou should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!â This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. Itâs a quick way to feel like a loser. Donât stop talking about your work (if youâre asked), and donât avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice, but look for effective ways to cope with it. âYou should work for Disney,â could be met with âThat might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?â Remember always that this is really your fan club; theyâre just disguised as a Greek chorus of know-it-alls. Dear Amy: I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, Iâm still a struggling artist and Iâm still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but Iâm excited to say Iâve just received an offer on my picture book. I am going to be a published childrenâs book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Childrenâs Book Writers and Illustrators and got involved with the local chapter. Iâm lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and Iâm sure theyâll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and canât give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. Sheâs still my biggest fan. â Soon to be Published Dear Soon to be Published: Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library. Dear Amy : You recently answered a question from âLiving a Lie,â who had been lying for 50 years, claiming to be a Vietnam veteran. I am a female military veteran. I, along with countless other women, served proudly alongside our male counterparts.

Image: Instagram/@chareepineda Charee Pineda, who was already over five months into her pregnancy, revealed that she lost her unborn child after its heart suddenly stopped beating. The actress shared the unfortunate news through her Instagram page on Monday, May 27, showing herself still admitted to a hospital. âAt 22 weeks and 1 day, our babyâs heart stopped beating . Our hearts were shattered but it surely made our faith stronger,â she said in the caption. âWe may not know why it had to happen but we trust that the Lord has better plans and all we can do is to let go and surrender. I know in my heart we will see you again, my love,â she added. Pineda then revealed she named her unborn child Christiana. âFor now, enjoy your time in heaven along with all the angels,â she stated. âWe canât wait to have you back in our arms in His time.â A post shared by Charee Pineda-Soledad (@chareepineda) Aside from her husband Martell Soledad and their firstborn Cesco who were both with the actress in the hospital, Pineda also received comfort from her fellow celebrity moms Angeline Quinto, Yasmien Kurdi, Lovely Abella and Melissa Ricks through the comments section. Image: Instagram/@chareepineda Image: Instagram/@chareepineda Pineda and Soledad tied the knot and welcomed Cesco in 2020. They announced her pregnancy last March.

        "content": "On Tuesday, DuPont (NYSE: DD ) stock received an upgraded rating from Citi, moving from Neutral to Buy, with an increased price target set at $95, up from the previous $85. The upgrade follows a positive investor reaction to recent company announcements, with DuPont shares experiencing an approximate 3% rise in the 1.5 days following the news. Citi's analysis indicates that DuPont's decision to operate its businesses independently could drive value through targeted growth and clearer portfolio structure. Additionally, the firm anticipates benefits from a recovery in the electronics sector and a reduction in destocking in more challenging markets. The main concern among investors has been DuPont's valuation, especially in the Electronics and New DuPont (RemainCo) segments. However, after reassessing DuPont's Sum of the Parts (SOTP) valuation in light of the new business structure, Citi has expressed confidence in the company's prospects. The firm's revised outlook is partially based on strong earnings expectations from the electronics division over the next 18 months. Moreover, Citi suggests that further details on the company's separation plan could act as additional positive catalysts throughout the year. DuPont's stock performance and Citi's upgraded rating reflect a broader sense of optimism regarding the company's strategic moves and potential market recovery. The new price target of $95 represents a significant increase and underscores Citi's positive expectations for DuPont's financial future.

        "content": "THIS is the shock moment riot cops raid a Costa del Sol club packed with bikini-clad tourists in a chilling crackdown known as Operation Marbella. The chilling footage shows nearly 20 heavily-armed police storming the Ocean Club Marbella in the Spanish resort of Puerto Banus and ordering revellers out of the pool. British holidaymakers watched on speechless in their swim shorts and bikinis as officers clad in body armour crashed the venue in a broad-daylight raid. Tourists packing out the \"beautiful people\" venue, which over the weekend held one of its two annual champagne parties popular with Bank Holiday visitors from the UK , were urged to keep calm. Police issued loudspeaker messages in Spanish and English saying: âThis is just a routine check. The minute we finish you can continue enjoying your afternoon. âDonât worry, thereâs nothing serious going on.â But the images of the operation, which lasted nearly two hours and also involved a police helicopter hovering overhead, showed why some revellers were left uneasy over the ordeal. One clubber is understood to have been arrested, although police have not yet commented officially on the reason for the detention. The spectacular club raid followed a string of shootings in the area, sparking the launch of the so-called Marbella Plan last month to keep British and Irish tourists safe. Police warned locals and visitors at the time they could expect to see more random stops and police checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They said nothing about surprise raids on busy tourist-popular venues, although earlier this month heavily-armed officers crashed a gym at a sports club in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia near Puerto Banus and made three arrests. Gym-users were asked for their ID before being allowed to continue with their routines. The series of shootings so far this year in the Marbella area included a March 11 attack on British-run eatery La Sala near Puerto Banus. The shooting led to the arrests in April of a British man and Irish national described by police as having links to organised crime. Kerry Katona recently claimed she had U-turned on a decision to move to the famous Costa del Sol resort with her family, including fianceÌ Ryan Mahoney, because of the violent incidents there. Fernando Bentabol, the prosecutor in charge of combating narco crime in the province of Malaga, which Marbella is part of, shone the spotlight on its dark underbelly in a recent newspaper interview. Asked by a local Spanish journalist if the Costa del Sol was turning into Medellin, Colombiaâs second largest city previously the most violent in the world and the former home of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar , he said: âYes and no. \"It canât be compared to Medellin because countries such as Colombia are the ones that produce drugs, and most of the actions there are related to plantations, as happens in Morocco for example with cannabis. âWe are in the area where the drugs are introduced and distributed to Europe. âBut in terms of the level of the organisations involved and their economic capacity, yes it can of course be compared.â Locals have branded parts of Marbella like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\". One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media, expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: âA stray bullet could end up entering a house.â In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella muncipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbellaâs famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18 day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. By Tom Malley SPANISH police have launched \"Operation Marbella\" to crackdown on violence and keep Brits safe after a spate of recent gang shootings. The Costa del Sol resort is fast becoming a hotspot for crime and cops have warned locals and visitors they can expect to see more random stops and officer checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They are understood to be increasing vigilance in residential areas as well as shopping centres and nightspots, like the millionaireâs playground of Puerto Banus. It comes after two terrifying shootings in March, within the space of a week. As police crackdown on crime they are recruiting the help of sniffer dogs and âaerial resourcesâ - including helicopters and drones. The start of the operation, which will continue through the summer season into October, comes after locals started branding areas like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\" following four shooting incidents in just over a month. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the âoriginal classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europeâs chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.â It adds: âDaytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. \"Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.â It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages round its saltwater pool cost up to â¬1,150 (Â£980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot, a luxury champagne from France . Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional â¬1120 (Â£955) minimum spend on Saturdays. A WAVE of anti-tourist measures are being implemented across Europe to curb mass tourism in popular holiday hotspots. Overcrowding has become the main problem in many sunny destinations, with authorities trying to find a solution to keep tourists and locals happy. Officials have attempted to reduce the impact of holidaymakers by implementing additional taxes on tourists, or banning new hotels. Earlier this year Venice became the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for holidaymakers after it started charging day-trippers â¬5 (Â£4.30) if visiting the historical Italian centre. It was followed by an area in Barcelona which resorted to removing a well-used bus route from Apple and Google Maps to stop crowds of tourists from using the bus. Meanwhile, San SebastiaÌn in the north of Spain, limited the maximum number of people on guided visits to 25 to avoid congestion, noise, nuisance and overcrowding. The city has already banned the construction of new hotels. The Spanish government has allowed restaurants to charge customers more for sitting in the shade in Andalucia. Benidorm has introduced time restrictions, as swimming in the sea between midnight and 7am could cost a whopping Â£1,000. The Canary Islands are also considering adopting measures to regulate the number of visitors - and charge tourists a daily tax. Greece has already enforced a tourist tax during the high season (from March to October) with visitors expected to pay from â¬1 (Â£0.86) to â¬4 (Â£3.45) per night, depending on the booked accommodation. Officials in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia want to introduce a fee for travellers to remind people to be courteous during their trips.",

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan â Taiwan's opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island's president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) â Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan's legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. Taiwan's legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke out into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "content": "LONG-TIME Derby favourite City Of Troy looks set to be replaced at the head of the market - as the wounded superstar loses supporters everywhere and drifts alarmingly in the market. City Of Troy suffered a disastrous 2000 Guineas after being sent off the red-hot 4-6 fav on the back of glowing reports from trainer Aidan O'Brien and a sensational two-year-old campaign. The Ballydoyle handler has since admitted he treated the colt 'like too much of a God' in the run-up as he crashed out at Newmarket. With doubts building over just how much these Justify colts train on at three and the horse's confidence no doubt shattered by his no show, punters are looking elsewhere in the Derby market. And Coral are predicting City Of Troy, who has spent months at the head of the market, will be replaced if money keeps coming in for two key rivals. One of them is Aidan O'Brien's Los Angeles, who's unbeaten in three, was a Group 1 winner last season and looks tailor made for the 1m4f Derby trip. Described by his trainer as 'lazy', Los Angeles was last seen holding off Euphoric to win a Group 3 over 1m2f at Leopardstown earlier this month. The other is Charlie Appleby's Dante runner-up Ancient Wisdom. Last year's Futurity winner was pumped six lengths by Economics at York but William Haggas will not run his stable star at Epsom. Ancient Wisdom might have been the second string of Godolphin had Hidden Law not suffered a fatal injury seconds after winning the Chester Vase . But he deserves his place near the top of the betting and is now into as short as 4-1. Los Angeles has been cut into 7-2 with City Of Troy drifting alarmingly out to 11-4. Bookies Coral joked City Of Troy is 'under siege' as Derby favourite - but there's no denying he could find himself completely friendless before Saturday's race. Coral's David Stevens said: \"City Of Troy was as short as 7-4 for the Derby last week, but in recent days Ancient Wisdom, who was 11-1, and Los Angeles, 6-1 at the weekend, have been the pair attracting the most support. \"The money has come to such a point where either could now end up replacing City Of Troy as big race favourite come Saturday.\" Betfred Derby odds via Coral 11-4 City Of Troy 4-1 Los Angeles 5-1 Ambiente Friendly, Ancient Wisdom 11-1 Dancing Gemini 12-1 Macduff 16-1 Bellum Justum 20-1 Voyage, 25-1 Deira Mile 33-1 Bar A responsible gambler is someone who: Find our detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here .",

The England international is ready to leave the Gunners after losing his first-choice status to David Raya. A move to the Magpies was mooted for Ramsdale, but Newcastle have found his 30m asking price too steep, says the Daily Mail . With FFP concerns looming, Newcastle are now seeking a cheaper alternative. Meanwhile, Ramsdale is also courting interest from Chelsea with the summer market now swinging open.

        "content": "Falling 7-1 behind George Russell in qualifying and blaming that on his team-mate getting Mercedesâ new front wing in Monaco, Jamie Chadwick says Lewis Hamilton is âspinningâ the narrative. Arriving in Monaco 6-1 down on Russell in the intra-Mercedes team-mate qualifying battle, Lewis Hamilton put his latest defeat to his team-mate down to Russell running Mercedesâ new front wing in Monte Carlo. Qualifying P7, 0.08s down on Russell who was P5, Hamilton said: âI anticipated it would be difficult to outqualify George because he has the upgraded component, but itâs just great to see that we are bringing upgrades. â I already know automatically that Iâm going to lose two-tenths going into qualifying. Thatâs definitely frustrating.â Going on to declare he does ânot anticipate being ahead of George in qualifying particularly this yearâ, Hamilton was pressed on the claim with a âweâll seeâ reply. But rather than read too much into Hamiltonâs comment, Williams development driver Chadwick believes Hamilton is âspinning itâ to suit his narrative. âI think he knows what heâs doing,â Chadwick told Channel 4. âHeâs spinning it to make it sound like heâs maybe not got the upgrades this weekend which for me, Iâm not sure about because a team like Mercedes, they generally always bring upgrades to both cars. âItâs not like they need to split it between the two cars. âSo yeah, I think he should take his hat off to George. Heâs 7-1 on someone like Lewis Hamilton, which is incredible. âAnd I think Lewis is probably not happy about that, to be honest. And thatâs where that comment has come from.â ð F1 2024: Head-to-head qualifying record between team-mates ð F1 2024: Head-to-head race statistics between team-mates Hamilton did in fact not have the upgraded front wing in Monaco, one report claiming the drivers tossed a coin to decide who would run it, another by Jenson Button saying the seven-time World Champion opted not to as damaging the wing in qualifying wouldâve meant a pit lane start as he wouldâve had to revert to an old spec. Chadwick reckons Hamilton best get used to be second on the list when it comes to new Mercedes parts. âHeâs on his way out next year,â she added, âGeorge is going to be staying in that seat for what they hope is a long time so they need to keep that seat and keep George happy. âAnd obviously that might come off the back of maybe Lewis being not so happy but at the same time heâs done an incredible job, heâs smashing him.â Up on Hamilton in qualifying and race stats, Russell is also ahead of his team-mates in the Driversâ standings with 54 points to 42.

        "description": "The company, one of Chinaâs largest private-sector conglomerates, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years.",
        "content": "Shanghai-based Fosun, controlled by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, announced on Tuesday that the proceeds of the sale will be used to replenish general working capital. The divestment aims at streamlining Fosunâs portfolio and âenhancing [our] asset-light operation strategyâ, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. âIt also demonstrates the companyâs continuous efforts to create maximum value for its shareholders.â Fosun, which is involved in a wide range of industries including tourism, pharmaceuticals, real estate and financial services, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years, co-chairman Wang Qunbin said during an earnings briefing on March 28. An asset-light strategy refers to a business model under which a company has only a small amount of fixed assets on its balance sheet. â[Fosun] could dispose of more noncore assets and could even target disposing of its stake in Hainan Mining, which could generate more than enough liquidity for all of its capital market debts,â Andrew Chan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a research note on Tuesday. Fosun owns nearly half of Shanghai-listed Hainan Mining, which has a market capitalisation of 14.6 billion yuan. Since April 2023, Fosun has spent more than US$46 million to buy its Hong Kong-listed shares as a way of boosting investor confidence, according to Chan. He added that Fosun is comfortable with its current liquidity buffer, which still has more than US$2 billion in assets that could be disposed of to enhance liquidity. Fosun reduced its interest-bearing debts, such as bank loans and corporate bonds, by 15 billion yuan to 211.9 billion yuan in 2023, according to the companyâs annual earnings report. It posted a net profit of 1.38 billion yuan for 2023, turning around from a net loss of 831.8 million yuan a year earlier. Its revenue grew 8.6 per cent to 198.2 billion yuan. Taking over HAL will strengthen ABN Amroâs position as one of the top three wealth-management firms in Germany and increase its assets by â¬26 billion. âThis is a rare opportunity to add scale to our German activities,â ABN Amro CEO Robert Swaak said in a statement. âThe proposed acquisition will further strengthen our position and offer employees of the combined group the opportunity to play a driving role in the consolidating German market.â",

        "description": "Consumer advocate says thereâs more deception in the world of online reviews than people realize. She recommends getting tips from friends and family instead.",
        "content": "We use them all the time â Yelp, Tripadvisor, the BBB â websites that post reviews by customers, clients and patients of all sorts of companies and health care providers. But can we trust these reviews? Are the websites that post them taking steps to assure they are legit? âNo and no,â says Kay Dean of San Jose, Calif., a former criminal investigator in the U.S. Department of Educationâs Office of Inspector General. Deanâs bad experience with a health care provider with glowing reviews led her on a journey into the expansive realm of fake online reviews. âI no longer put an ounce of trust in any online review site,â she says. She is the founder of Fake Review Watch , which she says is on the side of consumers and honest businesses and attempts to show the issues that major review platforms have with fake reviews.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Personal experience led to her investigation About seven years ago, Dean used stellar reviews she saw on Yelp and Google to select a medical care provider. âThe experience turned out to be the exact opposite of what was claimed on the platforms, leaving me suspicious about these reviews I had relied on. And so, drawing on my knowledge as an investigator, I began doing some digging and uncovered this medical practice was trading fake reviews with other businesses in Facebook groups.â She discovered that âthe online review world was saturated with so much deception â far more so than people realize.â Frustrated by a lack of official action against this widespread fraud, Dean created YouTube videos with case studies as real examples, which she offers to major news outlets. âThatâs been effective, but my larger goal is to highlight the culpability of tech companies and review sites that are not doing enough to protect the public. I try to educate people not to trust online reviews at all, and I attempt to rally public support for more enforcement and new legislation.â Fake reviews are very convincing I asked Dean to share the clues consumers should look for to alert them that they are reading a fake review. âIt is extremely difficult for the average consumer to discern which reviews are fake,â Dean notes, âas they can be very detailed and convincing, some written by the business itself. Iâve seen many contractor reviews with photos of work lifted off of a real estate listing in another state and thousands of Yelp reviews with content simply plagiarized from Tripadvisor written by other people, sometimes years earlier. Determining whether (a review is) real or fake often requires analyzing sets of reviewers and businesses together to see if suspicious patterns emerge indicating deception.â Dean points out that even the Better Business Bureau website âhas become polluted with review fraud, hosting plenty of fake BBB reviews. Iâve found that a robust black market exists for them, including several marketers in Facebook groups offering to sell BBB reviews. I reached out to one guy from Pakistan. He offered to sell them for $3 each!â Furthermore, she notes, the BBB site lacks transparency. âJust click on a BBB review to find out something about the reviewer. Nothing comes up. There are no photos. No last names are used, nor is there any other way of finding out who or what else the person has reviewed, or if they even exist. So while the BBB says, âTrust us,â you canât.â An industry of fake reviews Online networks, many based in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, sell fake reviews for the BBB, Yelp, Google, Angi and many more, charging as little as 50 cents per review. They have âprogramsâ for movers, lawyers, doctors, dentists, you name it, and will create fake positive and negative reviews that appear to come from real people in cities all over America. Sites such as Reviews That Stick offer reviews across multiple platforms to boost the reputation of a business. âMuch of the fraud, though, is organized on social media sites with impunity,â Dean says, adding, âFacebook does little to stop the marketing of fake reviews. There are scores of groups on its platform that openly facilitate buying and selling them. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , however, web-hosting platforms are not responsible for this kind of illegal activity conducted by third parties.â Houston defamation attorney Paul Sternberg says, âBut when the platform itself â such as the BBB â gives an A+ rating when they know or should know from hundreds of complaints the business is misleading its customers, I believe they have opened themselves up to being sued. Even if the platform says, âWe do not endorse,â the very fact of awarding that grade â which then is used by the business in its advertising â is an endorsement.â If we canât trust online reviews, then what? Dean believes that until social media sites like Facebook and review platforms such as Google and Yelp can be held accountable for the rampant review fraud they allow to be foisted on the public, not much will change. This would require congressional action. Until then, she recommends consumers use the old-fashioned method of choosing businesses â by talking to real relatives and friends about who they would recommend.

Knott Pebbled Leather Medium Crossbody tote, Â£375 Of course, jeans are a classic wardrobe essential, and while you may own a variety of styles; from skinny, to wide-leg, or flares, a straight leg in a classic blue denim wash is our top pick. If we were only to wear one pair of jeans for the rest of our lives it would have to be Levi's 501s, which complement any outfit, can be dressed up or down and are super flattering for all body types. Levis have stood the test of time, and are available in numerous waist and leg lengths to suit every body shape. From summer through to winter a pair of jeans are always a failsafe option. While we are trying to keep our capsule wardrobe to a minimum we recommend stocking up on this style in blue denim, ecru and black. 501s Levis Original Jeans, Â£100 We love a blazer more than anyone, as they are a versatile statement piece for anyone of any age, and for any occasion. Some may prefer fitted blazers, our personal favourite is an oversized design, as it is flattering, timeless, and much more versatile. You can wear your blazer over jeans and a jumper when heading to the office, over leggings and a hoodie for a quick dash to run errands, over a dress for drinks for a little more coverage, or on its own with knee-high boots, and cinched in with a belt for full-on glam. Blazers are created using various fabrics, such as wool, cotton, and linen, but we recommend a relaxed cotton design to see you all year long - as a wool blazer in summer or a linen blazer in winter isn't quite the most sensible style option. Relaxed Single Breasted Blazer, Â£69 When it comes to Autumn and Winter, a turtle neck, or roll-neck jumper is a must. They are chic, classy, timeless, formal and flattering as they elongate your arms and neck. They work as the perfect winter warmer, as you can style under a blazer, shacket, another jumper, or leather jacket. M&S has an impressive range of turtle neck designs, which also come in its signature Heatgen technology for extra warmth in the colder seasons. But come the warmer seasons you may switch to a sleeveless tank for layering. Pure Merino Wool Roll Neck Jumper, Â£35 We love a cosy knit jumper, and this & Other Stories number is a classic. A knit jumper is perfect to layer in winter, wear on its own, under a blazer or parker jacket, with jeans, leggings, a skirt, over a dress, paired with boots, trainers, you name it. But you can also keep it with you in the Spring and Summer seasons too, drape it over your shoulders so it is easy to slip on when the balmy nights turn a little chilly at those upcoming garden parties. This & Other Stories' jumpers are long-lasting, with a slightly boxy fit, so you have room to move or layer underneath. Mock Neck Sweater, Â£45 We have an entire drawer filled with T-shirts, the majority of which are classic white round-neck styles. Why? Because they go with everything. A round crew neck boxy t-shirt is a lifesaver for everyone and a non-negotiable in your capsule wardrobe. Arket's boxy style is perfect, as the short sleeves are the perfect length, the collar is not too tight or loose around the neck, and best still - the fabric is not see-through, yet not too heavy. Tuck into jeans, a skirt, or shorts, or wear over leggings, you can dress up or down, wear on its own, or layer on top. However you choose to style a white T-shirt, it will always look chic. Crew-Neck T-shirt, Â£17 If you only buy one pair of boots, make it a pair of classic black boots . One of the classics we return to time after time is a block heel ankle boot with a pointed or square toe because it goes with every outfit. You can pair this footwear must-have with jeans, a skirt and jumper for the office, and a blazer dress for weekend drinks, the possibilities are endless. Dear Frances has plenty of boot designs, but the Cube Boot is part of the Core Collection, which speaks volumes in our opinion. Cube Boot, Â£595 A cotton shirt sounds super formal but it doesn't have to be styled solely for the office with a suit. It's a must-have for those days you want to look \"done\" and well put together but with minimal effort. Worn with jeans and trainers, it looks classic and is a brilliant base under a chunky round knit jumper and leggings, or with smart trousers. You can even wear the shirt undone over a bralette for an evening out. Extra Fine Cotton shirt, Â£29.90 A pair of classic white trainers will never go amiss in your wardrobe. Some may prefer the timeless Converse, whether its high or low tops, Veja, the New Balance 550, or Superga's Nappa trainers or Cotu Classic, which are hugely popular with Kate Middleton. What we love is not only are they super fashionable, but they go with everything, and provide a little platform to elevate you. Pair with skirts and floral dresses in the summer, with jeans or trousers in winter and spring, as long as they are crisp and clean you will look super chic. 2740 Platform Nappa, Â£110 Over the last few years, our major obsession has been with leather trousers, faux or real, is up to you. Currently, we're loving a wide-leg leather pant, a more wearable silhouette than the PU leggings of seasons past. While they may not be the most summer-appropriate trousers, they will see you through every other season and occasion. You can pair your leather trousers with a slogan jumper, trainers and a trench coat for a casual but put-together look, with heeled boots, or a blouse and heels for evening drinks. I have lived in my straight, wide-leg, high-rise leather trousers for years, and continue to get compliments on them because they give a polished look no matter how you style them. Vegan Leather 90s Straight Pant, Â£82 A midi dress has been our firm favourite style for many years now, as it is practical, moveable and versatile. This design is suited for all ages, and suits various style preferences, as you can opt for midi shirt dresses, midi slip dresses, midi wrap dresses - and so much more. One of our personal favourites is a floral printed midi dress, like Nobody's Child, which is short-sleeved and falls midway down your calves as you can dress it up or down. Pair this number with sandals or trainers in the summer, heels for a wedding or formal occasion, or layer with a chunky knit jumper, tights and boots for the winter months. Wildflower Print Clover Midi Dress, Â£59 Linen shirts are essential when the warmer weather hits, whether that is in the balmy spring and summer seasons. If you are heading on holiday, or making the switch over from your winter wardrobe to summer, a linen shirt is paramount. You can layer over a t-shirt, tank top and jeans, or a skirt, for the daytime, or wear over a bikini for those pool days. It's lightweight and effortless, and you can even be bold by opting for a block colour such as vibrant green or bubble gum pink. Linen fabric is super gentle on the skin, and breathable, which is why it's a welcome alternative to a cotton poplin. Linen Shirt, Â£35 For shoppers looking for anything leather, or remotely biker/ rock chic inspired, Allsaints is the place to go. We have lusted after their leather jackets for longer than we can remember, and if you have yet to buy yours, now is the time to do so. We recommend an oversize biker style rather than a fitted leather, as it is more timeless, and goes with everything. Plus, the larger style, means you can wear it more if your body changes over the years. And the worn and weathered look after years of wear just makes it look cool and vintage, a win-win. Billie Oversized Leather Biker Jacket, Â£399 The LBD - also known as the little black dress - has been the iconic evening look for many years, and it is not going anywhere. A little black dress is classy and timeless, so it's no surprise it cuts our capsule wardrobe. Whether it is cotton, scuba or a satin slip dress, an LBD is a garment you will wear forever more, whether it is for a festival, drinks, or date night. You can pair it with knee-high boots, heeled boots, or stilettos, layer with a blazer or biker jacket over the top, or even opt for a t-shirt or sheer long sleeve underneath for a daytime look. The styling options know no bounds. Marlow Dress, Â£98 Wide-leg trousers have made a comeback in recent years, and we aren't mad about it. This style is flattering as the high-waisted design, and wide leg feature, means the trousers elongate your legs and skim over them so they appear longer and leaner. They are also a welcome alternative to formal smart trousers in the workplace, and jeans, which can feel a little restricting. Pleated Wide Leg trousers, Â£40 We love a trench coat in the Spring and Summer months, as well as the transitional periods between seasons. You can style it with a classic white top and jeans for a casual, yet chic, everyday look, or layer over a jumper or knitted roll neck should you wish. Some even wear over a tracksuit with a cap for those off-duty days. Premium Trench Coat, Â£51.60 (Was Â£129) A racer vest has become another wardrobe staple in recent years, and a welcome alternative to roll necks and t-shirts we wear all year round. This summer style is perfectly paired with trousers, jeans, shorts, as well as skirts, so you can get creative. What we love is River Island's design is longer length and not cropped, which some may prefer for more coverage. Plus, you can shop an unmissable deal on racer vests at River Island, which is two tops for Â£18. White Rib Racer Vest Top, Â£10 We don't feel an outfit is complete without jewellery. Over the years the resurgence of gold jewellery has proved hugely popular, and we are well on board. If you are unsure how to style gold jewellery, we recommend easing your way with a statement gold hoop, whether it is a smaller huggie or chunkier style. For those who love their accessories as much as we do, layer up with stackable rings, bracelets and bangles, as well as chokers and pendants - more is more. Missoma has a vast array of styles to shop across rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings, so you can shop sets or individual pieces to your heart's content. Medium Chubby Hoop Earrings, Â£115 Outerwear is essential, and one coat design we see time and time again is a pea coat, tailored coat, and straight coat. It comes under numerous titles but it is a straight coat, with button front fastening, is a long line and is more structured than a trench coat. You can style it with any outfit, as it instantly elevates any look. Fawn Felt Single Breasted Coat, Â£170 New Balance trainers are the hottest footwear trend now, but what is the best style for you? Best trainers for women, these are our favourite pairs to snap up. A leather jacket has always been one of our wardrobe staples, here's where to shop the outerwear.",

        "description": "Several products by Indian brands MDH and Everest in Singapore and Hong Kong were found to contain traces of harmful ethylene oxide.",
        "content": "Ethylene oxide is a colourless gas used as a pesticide and to make other chemicals. âThe issues have been sorted. We have put in place mandatory tests,â BN Jha, director of marketing at the Spices Board of India, the government regulatory and export promotion agency for Indian spices, told This Week in Asia on Monday . He noted that the contaminant was found in a consignment shipped 18 months ago and could have occurred naturally. India plans to conduct mandatory pre-shipment sample testing for six months, after which it will reassess the situation to see if there are persistent concerns. Raj Paroda, a former director general of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, told This Week in Asia: âWe are concerned because itâs a matter of prestige and reputation. The system should be made stronger in terms of traceability and quality.â MDH and Everest, two of Indiaâs most popular spice brands, have said their products are safe for consumption. âWe do not use ethylene oxide at any stage of our spice production. Our products adhere to stringent health and safety standards,â MDH said in a statement reported by Indiaâs Mint newspaper on April 28. Following the recalls, Britainâs food watchdog applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India starting this month. Once valued more than gold and silver, Indiaâs spices trade spurred European traders to sail to the country in the 15th century. While Indiaâs spice exports remain significant, the country must overhaul its approach to food safety and public communication to boost consumer confidence, industry experts say Over 400 products from India were flagged by the European Union between 2019 and 2024 for containing contaminants, according to a report by the Indian newspaper Deccan Herald. 03:28 Indiaâs beloved butter chicken dish is at centre of court case probing who invented it Smita Sirohi, a former agriculture adviser to the Indian embassies in Belgium, Luxembourg and the EU, said Indian authorities had tightened preventive measures to remove any residue from ethylene oxide. âI am surprised why similar steps were not taken for other markets since they had taken them earlier for the EU,â Sirohi said, referring to the recent cases in Hong Kong and Singapore. âCertainly it will have a damaging impact,â recalling how EU importers had cautioned about Indian spice consignments in earlier cases. India exports US$4 billion of more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries annually while the countryâs domestic market is the worldâs largest at US$10 billion, the Spices Board of India has estimated. The sheer variety of Indian spices makes it hard for traders to trace within the supply chain to the relevant farms, Sirohi said. Farmers typically send their spices to traders for aggregation and shipment in wholesale markets. Large factories would receive supplies from these markets, and contamination can occur potentially at each step of the supply chain, according to Sirohi. Though mandatory testing can show the presence of chemicals exceeding certain legal thresholds, the problem could only be resolved by assessing the stage of initial contamination in the supply chain, Sirohi said. Authorities also need to establish guidelines for chemical use and tighten food safety processes, she added. Indiaâs health ministry has said the country applies one of the worldâs strictest standards for capping residual pesticides through rigorous risk assessments. But the cases in Hong Kong, Singapore and Europe show food safety processes and oversight in India need further strengthening, industry players say. Ruchit G Garg, founder and CEO of Harvesting Farmer Network, an agriculture technology platform, said India needed to establish excellent food safety standards. âOur spices [and agricultural products] may or may not have had traces but our track record isnât very good and our farming practices arenât very organic,â he said. 02:27 One family, one polling station: remote Himalayan villagers cast votes in Indian general election âIndia needs to invest heavily in fixing its reputation to produce healthy, chemical-free agricultural products. It has a long reputation of producing chemical-rich food, much beyond the safe limits defined by many countries.â One market analyst said there could be a spillover adverse impact on other Indian products beyond spices. âThe fact that these two brands failed [to meet quality norms] does not speak well of them and could have a wider impact on other Indian brands,â said Lloyd Mathias, a Delhi-based angel investor and business strategist. âIndian standards have to be on a global benchmark. One cannot afford to have different standards. There can be absolutely no compromise on safety,â he said.",

        "content": "Bank of America (BofA) released a report forecasting that Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs), known as trend followers, are expected to sell the US dollar (USD) in significant amounts this week. The report suggests that these traders are likely to buy European Euro (EUR), British Pound (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), Japanese Yen (JPY), Mexican Peso (MXN), and Canadian Dollar (CAD) in response to movements in the currency markets. BofA's model indicates that the extent of USD selling by CTAs will correlate with the currency's declines. The more pronounced the drop in the USD's value, the greater the volume of USD that trend followers are expected to sell. This trend is underscored by the recent weakening of the JPY, which has returned to levels that previously triggered intervention by the Bank of Japan. The beginning of next week is marked by a bank holiday in both the United States and the United Kingdom, which BofA notes could lead to reduced liquidity in the foreign exchange (FX) markets. This environment of lower liquidity might leave the FX markets more vulnerable to larger movements should there be any substantial trading flows.

        "content": "However, according to CaughtOffside sources with knowledge of the situation, the English club and Unai Emery donât consider him as part of their plans and are already working to let him go â temporarily or permanently â during the summer. Aston Villa to cash in on Phillipe Coutinho At the moment, the big obstacle to a definitive farewell seems to be his contract at Villa Park, which runs until 2026. Coutinho is unwilling to lose money on his Â£135k per week deal by negotiating an early termination of the agreement. Aston Villa, for their part, have set what they consider a fair price for him of around Â£6m-Â£8m. Whilst that paltry figure shows how far his stock has fallen, it has piqued the interest of various clubs around the world. Among those are some teams from Qatar and elsewhere in the Middle East, who could decide to bring him back there in the summer. Vasco da Gama are also very interested in him and have already started to talk with the Brazilian player. At the moment, however, Vasco consider the costs of the possible operation too high, when adding the amount of a transfer to the salary requested by Coutinho. In any event, Aston Villa, to lighten their wage bill, are also willing to consider a loan but continue to hope that a club will take Coutinho on a permanent basis.",

        "content": "NEW CITY, , /PRNewswire/ -- GlycoNex (4168, hereinafter referred to as GNX), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of glycan-directed cancer immunotherapies, and PrecisemAb today announced a technology licensing agreement to develop a new generation of an anti-glycan antibody drugs aimed at increasing antibody specificity, reducing drug side effects, and enhancing treatment outcomes for a variety of solid tumors. Under the agreement, GlycoNex will license PrecisemAb's Universal Antibody Lock (UAL) technology platform, which modifies antibodies to inhibit their activity until activated by tumor proteases. Deploying UAL in conjunction with GlycoNex's anti-glycan antibody platform offers the potential to improve antibody drug behavior by enabling precise therapeutic effects on tumors, while enhancing the safety and tolerability of such drugs by reducing side effects caused by on-target, off-site binding. \"We are excited to collaborate with PrecisemAb and integrate the company's Universal Antibody Lock technology into our platform for developing anti-glycan antibodies targeting cancer-related glycoproteins,\" stated Dr. , CEO of GlycoNex. \"Our goal is to develop drugs capable of selectively activating in the tumor microenvironment, precisely targeting and killing tumor cells, while remaining inactive in the circulatory system and normal tissues, thereby reducing drug side effects and improving patient quality of life.\" Dr. , Chairman of PrecisemAb, commented: \"It is an honor to collaborate with leading glyco-biotech company, GlycoNex, in the development of innovative cancer treatments with anti-glycan antibodies. By applying PrecisemAb's Universal Antibody Lock technology, we aim to develop anti-glycan antibodies that offer patients safer treatment options.\" The Universal Antibody Lock technology was invented by Professor Tain-Lu Cheng's team at Kaohsiung Medical University and exclusively licensed to PrecisemAb. This technology can be widely applied in the fields of monoclonal antibody drugs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and bispecific antibodies, with a production process similar to that of conventional antibodies. The UAL platform is protected by patents in 18 countries. GlycoNex has 20 years of expertise in researching tumor-specific glycans and developing cancer-targeting antibody drugs. The Company is currently conducting international clinical trials for its own new drugs and biosimilars, including its lead program, GNX-102, which targets tumor-associated glycans and has demonstrated promising results in clinical trials to date.

        "description": "A new era begins at Stamford Bridge.",
        "content": "Chelsea are closing in on the appointment of Enzo Maresca â but what style of play can fans expect from the highly rated Italian coach? Having guided Leicester City to the Championship title last season, Maresca appears to have topped Chelseaâs shortlist to replace the outgoing Mauricio Pochettino after Roberto De Zerbi and Kieran McKenna were also considered by the Bluesâ hierarchy. Chelsea will need to pay around Â£10million in compensation but hope to have the Italian appointed by the end of the week. The 44-year-old will inherit a young and bloated Chelsea squad but one that did show promise towards the end of the season as they finished sixth to secure a return to European football. Following his retirement from the professional game in February 2017, which saw him play for the likes of Juventus and Sevilla, Maresca went straight into coaching. He enjoyed a stint as an assistant manager at West Ham under Manuel Pellegrini before being appointed as Manchester Cityâs Elite Development Squad manager in 2020. âManuel [Pellegrini] was the person who convinced me to try to become a coach when I decided to finish playing,â Maresca said. âSo, I always say that in terms of an experience about football, Manuel for me is like a father. âIf I had some doubt, to be honest he helped me a lot as a player and in the last two years when I worked with him when he was manager at West Ham, and I have a tremendous relationship with him. âI was still working like a player with him and one day during a chat with him he said: âYou know when you finish as a player you should try to become a coach because I think you can be a good coach.â Maresca enjoyed immediate success in his first season at City, guiding the team to the Premier League 2 title before leaving to join Parma at the end of the season. His time in Serie B was far from successful, though, and the Italian was sacked after just 14 games and he ended up returning to City in the summer of 2022 as one of Guardiolaâs assistants. âUnfortunately, it didnât go as I hoped,â Maresca said of his short stint at Parma. âWe signed 14 new players, it was a young team with an international environment, I was training in four languages, and it wasnât so quick to get certain concepts across. âThe start was difficult and from the outside there was a tendency to always see the glass as half empty. It ended after 13 games and I was very sorry, I still think we were on the right track.â Last summer, Maresca was appointed as Dean Smithâs replacement at Leicester and guided the Foxes straight back to the top flight after a superb season in the Championship. Despite a disappointing tenure at Parma, Marescaâs impressive spell at Leicester and attractive style of play has caught the eye of many over the last year. The former City assistant helped Leicester pick up 97 points en route to the title, with his side boasting the best defensive record in the league. In addition, Maresca oversaw a total overhaul of the teamâs style of play, turning Leicester into a possession-focused team, a philosophy and play style that is said to have appealed to the Chelsea hierarchy. âHeâs by far the best manager Iâve worked for,â Leicester City midfielder Harry Winks told Sky Sports in March. âHeâs incredible. I think everybody will say heâs going right to the top in [terms of] managerial stature. Heâs got everything. âHeâs a great man-manager. Heâs tactically incredible, some of the decisions that he tells us to do before the game and how he views the match is something Iâve never experienced before in football. âSo, yeah, itâs opened my eyes a lot to football in the way itâs played and the kind of Pep Guardiola style as well, I know he worked with for a long time. âIâm loving my football, it works perfectly for me. Itâs exactly the kind of football that I want to play and buy into. âI think since he has come in, Iâve learned so much and continue to do that.â Maresca values control of the ball and positional play above all else. In the Championship, Leicester were known for their patient and possession-heavy build-up but this did not come at the expense of goalmouth action, with Leicester scoring 89 goals throughout the season â a tally only bettered by Ipswich. Maresca likes to involve his goalkeeper as a key cog in their intricate build-up from the back and also uses inverted full-backs to help with ball retention in central midfield. A deep-lying playmaker â as opposed to a more physical defensive midfielder â is preferred at the base of midfield to help recycle possession, with the other midfielders expected to push forward and make runs in behind the oppositionâs defence. With full-backs operating infield, Maresca likes his forwards to stay high and wide in attack, although the central striker often drops deep to aid build-up. When they lose the ball, Maresca wants his side to press quickly and high to try and regain the ball, before dropping back into a 4-4-2, with a central midfielder pushing up alongside the striker to try and win the ball back. âWhen you go out on the pitch you know exactly what to do and how the opposition are going to operate and what you can do to affect that,â Winks said in an interview with talkSPORT this season. âTo do it so simply is the most important thing. Thatâs a thing a lot of managers probably struggle with, getting the message across, but the gaffer does it so well here.â Maresca favoured a 4-3-3 formation at Leicester, although he has used a 4-2-3-1 as well at points. Robert Sanchezâs ball-playing capabilities could see him return as first-choice goalkeeper, while Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofanaâs pace and passing attributes make them a potentially exciting centre-back partnership. Pochettino used Marc Cucurella as an inverted full-back towards the end of last season and the Spaniard could continue there under Maresca. Reece James often played in central midfield for Wigan during his loan spell in 2018/19 and could be deployed in a similar role on the right side. Man Utd star told Erik ten Hag he did not want to play in FA Cup final Former Chelsea player set to return as part of Enzo Maresca's coaching staff Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Arsenal miss out on Pot 1 for Champions League draw next season Moises Caicedo may be tasked with the playmaking role at the base of midfield, with Enzo Fernandez allowed a greater license to get forward. Cole Palmer may start further back in central midfield under Maresca, but the Italianâs play style should still allow Chelseaâs standout performer this season to flourish in advanced positions. In attack, Christopher Nkunkuâs all-round capabilities could afford him a second chance after a wretched injury-affected first campaign at Stamford Bridge, while Noni Madueke and Mykhailo Mudrykâs pace and dribbling abilities make them obvious candidates to start out wide.

Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major binge eating disorder market share @ Binge eating disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large quantities of food in a short period while feeling a loss of control over eating behavior. Unlike bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge eating disorder typically do not engage in compensatory behaviors such as purging or excessive exercise to counteract the binge eating episodes. Several factors contribute to the development of binge eating disorder, including genetic predisposition, psychological factors like stress or low self-esteem, and environmental influences such as societal pressure to attain certain body ideals.

        "content": "A couple of weeks ago, shortly before it became apparent that Congress wonât be regulating the rapid development of AI technology anytime soon, the leading avatar for chatbots and other generative AI tools, Sam Altman, showed us all the true face of Big Tech and Silicon Valley, once again. Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted out a single wordââherââon May 13, as the companyâs engineers demonstrated the capabilities of its latest AI-powered voice assistant model, ChatGPT-4o, on a livestream. The message was a clear reference to the uncanny resemblance between the assistantâs voice and the voice of a real, live, and very identifiable woman, actress Scarlett Johansson, who played an AI assistant that forms a romantic and sexual relationship with a human in the movie . The intentional decision to employ a flirtatious female voice on a that will probably become near-ubiquitous one day was questionable enough. But days later, Johansson implied in a that OpenAI may have simply stolen her voice, or created a fake facsimile, after she rejected an offer to work for the company. OpenAI has that the voice was meant to sound like Johansson, and produced records showing it hired a different actressâalthough itâs also true that the company telegraphed repeatedly that its new feature was inspired by , and intimated that Johansson agreed to let the company use her voice. The move came days before Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) closed several months of with tech CEOs by announcing a âroadmapâ that calls for billions in government spending on further AI research and development, and . A group of academics, tech accountability, and civil rights groups responded with a , explaining that researchers, labor organizations, and other public-interest groups âwere marginalized in the conversation,â while âsome of the loudest and most-self serving voices from the industry,â including Altman, Elon Musk, and Marc Andreessen, had lawmakersâ ears. âAny legislative process that begins with industry in the driverâs seat is fated not only to fail the public interest, but even to exacerbate AIâs ongoing harms,â the group said in the May 20 report. The dispute between OpenAI and Johansson is a neat distillation of the cluelessness, the soft bigotry, and the apathy with which the titans of industry and Big Tech conduct themselves as they develop what are widely expected to become the most world-altering, and dangerous, technologies in human history. The case also involves overt sexism and bias, which has been a of AI applications in the past. And as much as anything, itâs a clear indication of the industryâs willingness and ability to unfairly exploit and abuse the labor of even the most powerful, well-off workers in our society. Kate Devlin, a lecturer in AI and society at Kingâs College London and author of , said the companyâs offer to Johansson was a very deliberate choice to align its vision and products with the imagined future in âi.e., people substituting interaction with attentive computers for human relationships, and even falling in love with them. The movie, incidentally, was a depiction of dystopia, not a love story. âThis is despite years of criticism about the reductive and unhelpful predominance of female voices for subservient virtual assistants,â Devlin added. âSex sells, and OpenAI knows they can get a lot more engagement with a persona for their model that coos and giggles at your every command.â Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a Brown University professor who participated in the discussions with CEOs and Congress, said the dispute shows the need for immediate regulation, so there are rules in place to protect the public while companies are debuting AI products and experimenting with the emerging technology. âThey did this with a fair amount of impunity,â Venkatasubramanian said. âThe idea that âyou do this first and if someone complains weâll see what happensâ is very much the ethos of a lot of what happens in this area for a while now. This is just an attention-grabbing example.â OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. that she received an offer âto voice the current ChatGPT systemâ last September, which was around the same time that Altman said publicly that is his about AI, during a demo and Q&A session at a customer relationship management conference. The movie âinspired us,â and âcertainly more than a little bit,â Altman said. Reporters the resemblance during the demo between the so-called âSkyâ voice and Johanssonâs, all the way back in September 2023. Johansson declined OpenAIâs initial offer; and she never responded to a renewed offer from Altman this month, two days before the release of ChatGPT-4o, according to her statement. Yet, despite the lack of consent, the new voice assistant feature dropped last week, alongside Altmanâs âherâ tweet, and with a voice âso eerily similarâ to Johanssonâs that her âclosest friendsâ could not tell the difference, the actress said in her statement. Whatever else might be said about its portrayal of the future, is a movieâan expression of human imagination meant to tell a story and to maybe say something about life and living. On the other hand, Altman is a real guy, whose company apparently ignored a real womanâs denial of consent, and capitalized on her likeness and on-screen personas (her labor, in other words) in the real world. Most people probably understand on an intuitive level exactly what OpenAI and Altman were doing. Research suggests that casting actors who are known mainly for voice acting into voiceover roles allows filmmakers to take advantage of the starâs on-screen persona(s). In this case, we have an actress who is well known as a sex symbol, and whose on-screen personas, including in , have been described as â ,â and â â by film critics. In short, by âcasting Johansson as Samantha, the film allows us to associate Samantha with how Johansson looks, thereby giving Samantha a âphantomâ sexual presence,ââ according to by Devlin, at Kingâs College, and others. Similarly, by trying to âcastâ Johansson, and by using a similar voice, OpenAI apparently sought to imbue its product with those same qualities, in order to entice more customers. Itâs quite a move for a company whose technology is expected to help form the AI infrastructure on Apple and Microsoftâs ubiquitous devices. Itâs also worth noting that OpenAI was criticized by in December for having an all-male and all-white board, and for nominating Larry Summers, who of sexist remarks. The company to its board in March. Venkatasubramanian said he was struck by how AI companies evade responsibility for their design choices. âOn one hand, they convey the impression that what theyâre doing is like sci-fi, alien and completely different from anything ever done before,â he said. âThey do that through the voice thatâs been described as âflirty,â and by cryptically referring to the movie. These are deliberate choices. But when confronted they tend to back off and say we didnât mean that.â are no less worrisome. As a background matter, the âmagicâ behind AI often includes . OpenAI, a company worth billions, has to Kenyan workers making less than $2 an hour. The development points to how AI threatens a broad range of professions, including white-collar or so-called knowledge workers, and even the most powerful in our society. Johansson chose not to work for Altman and OpenAI; still, the company was able to use its huge public profile and its technology to reap much of the attention and other benefits that it would have gained if Johansson decided to sign a contract with them. Johansson has said that the company only took down the âSkyâ voice after she was forced to hire legal counsel, and itâs likely she will pursue the apparent violations of her publicity rights. She may have a good case with some precedent: Going back to the 1980s, artists like and , who are famous for their distinctive, recognizable voices, have successfully sued companies that hired people to impersonate their voices for commercial use. The Midler case went all the way to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that a famous voice is distinctive enough that an imitator cannot be used in a commercial enterprise without consent and approval. The dispute also parallels more recent circumstances, when the popular artist Drake released a song that relied on AI to generate the voice of the late Tupac, who remains one of the best-selling artists within the genre. Lawyers representing the late rapperâs estate sent a letter saying their client âwould never have given its approval,â and was dismayed by the âflagrant violation of Tupacâs publicityâ rights and âthe legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.â The song was scrubbed from social media after the threat of legal action. Ironically, was the victim of a possible publicity rights violation in April, when a content creator uploaded a new song believed to have featured AI-generated vocals from Drake and The Weeknd. At the time, the artistsâ label, Universal Music Group, made the stakes clear in a statement condemning AI-generated content that infringes on publicity rights: The issues raise a question as to which side of history these companies want to be on, UMG said: âthe side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,â a UMG spokesman in a statement reported by NPR. UMG has artificial-intelligence platforms over using its copyrighted works to âtrainâ models; and other major businesses, like , the , and a host of other publications, have filed lawsuits against companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. OpenAI had to have known about these controversies before deciding to rip off Johanssonâs likeness. And yet it wasnât a deterrent to the multibillion-dollar company. , or the fast-growing category of work known as content creation, is uniquely vulnerable to artificial intelligence. In a sense, content creators, who are effectively contract workers for social media platforms, often lack and conditions of their employmentâthe algorithmic systems that handle ranking and content moderation. The dispute with Johansson is simply a high-profile example of the power Big Tech and AI companies wield. Of course, the dispute also demonstrates a kind of cluelessness in the industry, much like the that showed a hydraulic machine crushing a trumpet, piano, books, and other instruments of creativity and imagination, and replacing them with the latest iPad. (Apple pulled the ad and apologized after receiving major backlash.) Polls show that most Americans donât trust companies to use and develop AI responsibly. A recent Pew Research Center showed that 70 percent of Americans say they have âlittle to no trust in companies to make responsible decisions about how they use AI in their products,â and 80 percent said the information companies collect in the process âwill be used in ways that people are not comfortable with.â Still, industry leaders are trying to sell us on a vision of the future and of AI focused on deep relationships with flirty, attention-trapping computers that sound like Scarlett Johansson, which will also read our children and make things like musical instruments and pencils obsolete. Itâs almost laughable, until you remember the actual stakes at hand when it comes to AI, and the fact that these companies are still unregulated in the U.S.",

        "description": "In his quest for a sixth term, 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, a Democrat, is facing a challenge in the June 11 primary.",
        "content": "In his quest for a sixth term, 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, a Democrat, is facing a challenge in the June 11 primary. Columbia attorney Austin Drake Nichols is making a bid for the office. The 1st Judicial Circuit includes Orangeburg, Dorchester and Calhoun counties. Party primaries will be held June 11 with any runoff scheduled for June 25. The general election is Nov. 5. Pascoe was first elected in 2005 as solicitor for the 1st Judicial Circuit. \"Being a prosecutor has been a calling my entire adult life. It is all I've wanted to do even before law school. A prosecutor's duty is to seek justice in every case and protect the rights of both victims and defendants,\" the 57-year-old said. \"I take this role very seriously since a prosecutor is the only person in the judicial system whose job is to do 'justice.' Other than being a father to three amazing sons, being solicitor is both the most important and only job I desire waking up to every morning,\" said Pascoe, who is married. Pascoe said his office would seek justice, something which he has experience in. \"Having done it for 30 years and having prosecuted corrupt politicians at the Statehouse, I am in a unique position which is allowing me to call out selfish and corrupt behavior when their actions impede the fairness of our justice system,\" he said. Pascoe was assigned as a special prosecutor in a public corruption probe of the General Assembly in 2014. He oversaw the investigation and secured the convictions and office removals of five state General Assembly members, including the House speaker, Senate president pro tem, House Judiciary chairman and two former House majority Leaders. \"I have the experience in bringing diversion programs to our circuit by establishing drug courts and a Youth Mentor Program, which has been recognized as best in the state. I am currently in the process of getting a youth program implemented to deal with our current statewide epidemic of guns in the hands of our children,\" Pascoe said. The Youth Mentor Program was the first of its kind in the 1st Circuit to target youth juvenile violence by linking the judicial system with the local faith community, the solicitor said. He continued, \"My office has been working with Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell and the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office for several months now to come up with a program that will be operational very soon.\" Pascoe said the difference between him and his opponent is that he brings more \"experience, results and commitment to the community.\" \"I have 30 years prosecutorial experience and successfully tried over 200 violent crime cases. My opponent has none. I have created drug courts and diversion programs in our circuit. My opponent has no such experience. Finally, I live in the circuit and raised three sons in Calhoun and Orangeburg counties. My opponent was not even registered to vote in the district when he filed to fun,\" he said. Pascoe is a 1989 magna cum laude graduate of The Citadel. He graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1993. He worked as a state prosecutor with both the 5th Circuit Solicitor's Office and Attorney General's Office after graduating law school. As an assistant solicitor, he was profiled on Court TV for the guilty verdict of Jeffery Weston, one of the state's only murder trials where the victim's body has never been discovered. As solicitor, he said he again successfully prosecuted a \"no body\" murder case in Orangeburg County, securing the murder conviction of Kenneth Cutter. Pascoe also cited the life sentences given to two men responsible for the murder of 6-year-old Winston Hunter of Woodford. Nichols is an attorney with the The Rutherford Law Firm LLC, 1315 Blanding, Columbia, SC 29202. The 29-year-old Anderson native said he now resides in Calhoun County and that questions surrounding his residency are unfounded. According to filing information with the South Carolina Election Commission dated April 1, 2024, Nichols lists his address as 1708 Bridge St. in St. Matthews. \"I reside right on Bridge St. in Calhoun (County). If I didn't reside in the county, I wouldn't have been eligible to even apply to run. It's another attack just because I'm young and haven't been out of law school much. So I've moved around,\" Nichols said. He said he is also registered to vote at the same place. \"You can't be registered to vote somewhere else and run somewhere else,\" he said. He said he wants to accomplish two things if elected. \"One, I want to be able to prosecute cases for the whole circuit. That is going to include making sure that from top to bottom -- myself included and everyone in the office -- is trained and skilled. Not saying that they aren't now, but that we continue to be intentional about polishing up our skills and polishing up our trial advocacy and studying, growing and developing that so that we're strong and effective when we're in the courtroom,\" Nichols said. He continued, \"But like I keep saying, particularly for Orangeburg, it's a college town, it's a college community. There's a lot of young people in the 1st Circuit, and I wanted to get young people back involved in service, back involved in wanting to be in law enforcement, go to law school and be a lawyer, work in the victim's advocate office, work in some type of role with city, town, county and state government.\" Nichols said he wants to \"encourage our youth and encourage young people to be civil servants.\" \"We're going to do that through the good work and through the hard work that we do while we're having fair, common sense and strong prosecution, but also making sure that we're touching the community,\" he said. He joined the firm of SC House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford of Richland County in August 2023. \"I do a lot of civil litigation all over the state. I'm licensed in both South Carolina and in D.C. I do some criminal defense, as well,\" Nichols said. He is a graduate of Westside High School in Anderson. \"I just had a little brother and niece graduate from Westside. I went to Coastal Carolina for undergrad, was student body president there and then went to law school at (the University of South) Carolina,\" he said, noting that he got his undergrad degree in political science, with a minor in ancient philosophy. He was married in April. \"It has been an extremely busy spring for me. No children, just a lot of nieces and nephews, and no animals, yet, but hopefully I can convince her to get one when this is said and done,\" Nichols said. As far as his campaign, he said it's not all about winning. \"At the end of the day in this race, we're all Democrats. ... Whether I win, or Mr. Pascoe wins this primary, I am certain that either of us will do a great job. Either he'll continue to do a great job, or I will do a great job. But we've got to continue to support Democrats along this journey, and we've got to continue to uplift people of the 1st Circuit, particularly our young people.\" Contact the writer: dgleaton@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5534.

        "content": "A 25-year-old Orangeburg man is accused of stalking a woman and causing her to fear for the safety of her and her family, according to a warrant. Gabriel Kimani Berry, of Wolfe Trail, is charged with stalking. Berryâs ex-girlfriend claims he has been harassing and stalking her for about two months. She fears that the alleged incidents wonât stop until Berry kills her, according to the incident report. She told officers she hadnât left her residence in a week because she was afraid sheâd encounter Berry. A warrant accuses Berry of using a pattern of words and conduct âthat served no legitimate purpose and was intended to causeâ his accuser âfear of bodily injury and/or death of herself and her family.â It goes on to accuse Berry of: â¢ Calling and texting his exâs phone, threating to âsmack the f - - -â out of her with one of his guns. â¢ Driving by his exâs residence and vandalizing her property. â¢ Displaying a weapon and posting his exâs whereabouts on social media. â¢ Threatening his ex and her mother on Facebook. Berry was taken into custody on May 21. Orangeburg Municipal Judge Chasity Avinger did not set bail on Berry on Wednesday, leaving that matter to be considered by a circuit judge later. If Berryâs convicted, he faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Contact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545. Follow on Twitter: @MRBrownTandD.

        "content": "An Indian climber rescued from Everest has died in hospital, a Nepali tourism official said Tuesday, taking the number of fatalities this season on the worldâs highest mountain to eight. Banshi Lal, 46, was plucked from the mountain last week and taken to a hospital in Nepalâs capital Kathmandu. âHe died at the hospital yesterday,â Rakesh Gurung of the tourism department told AFP. Three people â a British climber and two Nepali guides â among the eight are listed as missing but presumed dead. The latest fatality comes as the Everest mountaineering season nears its end, with the death toll relatively low compared to other years. Last year was the deadliest season on the mountain with 18 fatalities. Three others died climbing other Nepali peaks including a Romanian aiming for Lhotse, neighbouring Everest, and a French and a Nepali climber on Makalu, the fifth-highest peak. Nepal is home to eight of the worldâs 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds typically calm. All the Everest deaths occurred in areas above 8,000 metres (26,200 feet), known as the âdeath zoneâ, where thin air and low oxygen levels heighten the risk of altitude sickness. Nepal has issued more than 900 permits for its mountains this year, including 419 for Everest, earning more than $5 million in royalties. More than 600 climbers and their guides have already reached the summit of Everest after a rope-fixing team reached the peak last month. China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the pandemic. You must be logged in to post a comment.

According to the statement, âInformation show that our gallant military troops have succeeded in neutralising 9,303 terrorists/criminals, including degenerated kingpins such as Damina, Dangote, Kachalla Azarailu and Boderi among others âThis is apart from the arrest of 6,998 and the rescue of 4,641 hostages, among other achievements. âAnother key achievement of Mr. President in the last year was the signing of the Access to Higher Education Act, 2023, into law on June 12, 2023. âThis law enables indigent students to access interest-free loans for their educational pursuits in any Nigerian tertiary institution, a move considered as a fulfillment of one of his campaign promises to liberalize the funding of educationâ. âHowever, we call on school managements to be accountable and transparent by ensuring that studentsâ data are promptly uploaded to the NELFUND site to enable students to access the loan. âWe call on NELFUND to ensure the principle of federal character is upheld; all regions must have a fair share regardless of state, religion, and tribe. âWe also call on the government to consider paying both the academic and non-academic staff unions their outstanding emoluments to avoid elongation of the academic year, which may further complicate the student loan plans. âWe have seen a situation where ASUU went on strike for eight months under the last administration. âWe also caution school management to halt any plans of hiking school fees because of the student loan, as it will be vehemently resisted.â",

        "content": "Palestinian Premier and Foreign Minister Mohammad Mustafa revealed that five European countries will soon recognize the Palestinian state. In exclusive statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, he said: âOther important and internationally prominent non-European countries will follow... They will also soon recognize the Palestinian state, and some of them may take several months...â In a telephone interview with Asharq Al-Awsat from Riyadh, the prime minister underlined the importance of Saudi Arabiaâs role, stressing that coordination with âthe brothers in Saudi Arabia is at the highest level.â âSaudi Arabia has linked any regional peace to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,â Mustafa stated, adding that the Kingdom plays a diplomatic role in pushing for the release of Palestinian funds that are withheld by Israel, and in supporting the governmentâs plans for the post-war stage. Commenting on the Brussels meeting, during which the Palestinian Prime Minister presented the reform plan with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Quartet office on Palestine, Mustafa noted that all partners have âpraised the governmentâs reform program [...] and the wise policy of President Mahmoud Abbas.â Meanwhile, a European official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the European Union appreciates Saudi Arabiaâs efforts with regard to reviving the peace process. Luis Miguel Bueno, the official spokesman for the European Union for the Middle East and North Africa, referred to the meeting in Brussels, on Monday, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the Emirates. Bueno highly valued the Kingdomâs efforts towards ending the war and establishing a âPalestinian state that lives side by side with the State of Israel.â The European official also pointed to intensified diplomatic movements in Brussels, which he said âexpress a shared vision by the European Union and our Arab partners to move forward towards a two-state solution.â British foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday an investigation by the Israeli army into the Rafah air strikes must be \"swift, comprehensive and transparent\", again calling for a pause in fighting. âDeeply distressing scenes following the air strikes in Rafah this weekend,â Cameron said on X, saying the âinvestigation must be swift, comprehensive and transparent.â âWe urgently need a deal to get hostages out and aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.â Israeli tanks reached the center of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city center. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night's attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro SaÌnchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. âThis is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,â SaÌnchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israelâs Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying SaÌnchez's government was âbeing complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.â Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that âfor more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.â While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gazaâs city of Rafah. After Mondayâs meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister MicheaÌl Martin said âfor the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctionsâ for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EUâs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israelâs air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazaâs Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countriesâ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries â more than two-thirds of the United Nations â recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahuâs government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, SaÌnchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was âa decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.â The Socialist leader, who announced his countryâs decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a ceasefire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israelâs response. SaÌnchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that âthe recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.â The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the movement seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. âWe will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,â SaÌnchez added. âFurthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,â SaÌnchez said. âFrom the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.â Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied. The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanonâs Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latterâs Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the âexercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attackâ. Israelâs announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israelâs i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The townâs municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the townâs fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. âWe expect the number to riseâ, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the lattersâ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by âtargeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.â The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as weâve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to âterrorist launches.â The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were âcivilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.â Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks âconducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel âwill not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.â âThe only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,â he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israelâs ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent âappalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)â in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee âstressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.â It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of âdiscussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.â It called for âconfronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian peopleâ and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for TuÌrkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, TuÌrkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said.",

MANILA, Philippines (AP) â A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the countryâs eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoonâs shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon provinceâs capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governorâs residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. âEven before the typhoon hit, weâve transported relief goods in places near the typhoonâs expected path, so they were all ready,â Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago, which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the worldâs most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.

        "content": "North Korea's military satellite launch fails, rocket explodes in Yellow Sea. Analysts suspect Russian assistance in new engine type. North Korea's latest military reconaissance satellite launch ended in failure as the rocket exploded and fell into the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff. Analysts say it shows progress in the country's space ambitions despite the setback. North Korea said that tried a new âliquid oxygen and petroleum engineâ with the rocket which failed during its first stage. Initial analysis suggests issues with the newly developed liquid-fuel rocket motor, though other causes are being investigated, according to the state media. While the rocket remains unnamed and no were released, analysts believe it differs from the Chollima-1 used in previous successful launches. The Chollima-1, which also had explosive test failures, uses hypergolic fuels that ignite on contact and are typically used in North Korea's nuclear missiles, which do not use liquid oxygen due to storage temperature challenges. The new engine type may indicate Russian assistance, as Russia has previously vowed to help North Korea's satellite programme. Liquid oxygen engines, like those developed by Russia, require specialised storage and handling due to extremely low boiling points. The shift to a new engine type might allow North Korea to differentiate its civilian space program from its missile program, which is banned by the UN Security Council. Russian experts have reportedly visited North Korea to aid in this effort, though the specifics of their assistance are unclear. Analysts suggest that with proper data analysis from the failed launch, North Korea could attempt another launch soon.",

        "content": "Manchester City captain Kyle Walker admits he never began his career as a fullback. For many, Walker is now the best fullback City have seen. But he told the club's website of his time as a junior with Sheffield United: I don't know a right-back or a full-back who started off there. I couldn't get a game at centre-forward to be completely honest. I signed my scholarship and there were better centre-forwards than me, even though I went to Lilleshall as a centre-forward at Under-16s. I was a late developer. I didn't grow and I was very light. We played Nottingham Forest and they had a quick winger, but the right-back at the time wasn't playing for one reason or another. The coach put me there and from that day on I have never played another position. At first, I thought why am I not playing centre-forward? Why am I not getting the goals and the glory? But you soon realise it's quite enjoyable. Your role changes in the team and I enjoyed setting people up rather than scoring. I went from getting the odd 10 or 15 minutes in the first four months after I came out of school and into full-time football, to playing every game.\" This article first appeared on Tribal Football and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A Michigan mom was fatally struck by an out-of-control vehicle while heroically saving her two-year-old daughterâs life at a drag racing event on Sunday. Kadie Price, 33, was in the crowd with her family when a 1980 Jeep CJ lost control and veered off the racing strip before slamming into another vehicle, police said. The other vehicle, which had been stationary at the time of impact, struck Price as a result â just seconds after she had pushed her daughter to safety. Chaos ensued at Silver Lake State Park Sand Dunes in western Oceana County â about 270 miles northwest of Detroit, MLive.com reported . Despite several people rushing over to offer immediate care to Price, including Silver Lake State Park rangers, they were ultimately unable to save her. Price was pronounced dead shortly after she was struck just before midday. Her daughter was able to avoid âserious injury or worse,â police said, as a result of her momâs quick-thinking. âPlease keep the Price family in your prayers,â the Oceana County Sheriffâs Office said in a statement. The driver of the Jeep is being identified as a 64-year-old man who hails from Michigan. His name is not being released at this time as the investigation is ongoing. Two off-roaders who took part in Sundayâs race have since detailed the horrific incident. âIâve been coming out here a long time,â Bryce Straubel told WOOD . âThat was probably one of them most brutal accidents Iâve ever seen.â âIt breaks me,â Straubel added. âPeople are coming out here to have a good time and this mother just lost her life. She pushed her daughter out of the way to save her â itâs just rough to hear. It really is.â The Silver Lake State Park is a 3,000-acre park runs along the shorelines of Lake Michigan. It contained about 2,000 acres of san dunes.",

        "description": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday.",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines â A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country's eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon's shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province's capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor's residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. \"Even before the typhoon hit, we've transported relief goods in places near the typhoon's expected path, so they were all ready,'' Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago, which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

        "content": "The talented young Frenchman has shone at Selhurst Park and clearly seems ready to make the step up to a bigger club, with key figures clearly eager for him to make the move to Stamford Bridge. According to Phillips, Shields is driving this and pushing for the Blues to sign Olise, who has a Â£60m release clause at Palace, and who is also wanted by Man Utd. The report adds that Olise came very close to joining Chelsea last summer, so it could still be that they will be able to lure him to the club this year, in what could be a vital move for the west Londoners to bring in a much-needed upgrade on the likes of Mykhailo Mudryk, Raheem Sterling and Noni Madueke. Olise transfer: Should he choose Chelsea or Man United? Chelsea and United are two of the biggest clubs in England, and indeed Europe, so it might not be the easiest choice for Olise if it comes down to a decision between those two. Still, even if MUFC just won the FA Cup final, there clearly seems to be a more promising project being put together at CFC, especially once they finalise a deal to . The Red Devils are surely at an earlier stage of their project due to the recent change in ownership and new arrivals at board level, so that could likely mean a change of manager in the near future, as well as numerous ins and outs in the transfer market. Olise would do well to take these things into consideration when choosing his next move, though in truth heâll perhaps be hoping the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool join the race as theyâd likely be much better moves for him at this stage!",

A few isolated showers will be possible north of I-4 late in the morning along with a few showers developing along I-75 and quickly pushing inland through the early afternoon hours. Most of the rain moves over to the east coast this evening. It will still be warm and very muggy through the day with highs in the low 90s and feels like temperatures close to the triple digits. Although this is a cold front, it is not going to drop our temperatures but it will bring us lower humidity for Wednesday and Thursday.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email t the start of a new school year, you are standing in front of your closet and thinking about what to wear. As you assess your options, one thing becomes clear â itâs time for a fresh pair of shoes to kick off the school year in style. Whether boys school shoes or girlâs school shoes, buying new shoes for the school year offers numerous benefits beyond just fashion. In this article, you will explore five compelling reasons why investing in new shoes for the school year is a smart choice. 1. Outgrown Shoes Your feet can grow quickly, especially during growth spurts. Wearing shoes that are too small can be uncomfortable and even harmful to your feet. Check if your toes feel cramped or if your heels slip out of your shoes when walking. If your shoes feel tight or uncomfortable, itâs time for a new pair that fits properly. Getting shoes that fit ensures your feet have enough room to grow and stay healthy throughout the school year. 2. Increased Activity Levels As the school year starts, you might find yourself getting more active with sports, games, and other activities. Wearing proper shoes is essential to keep up with your increased activity levels. Athletic shoes provide support and cushioning to help prevent injuries and keep you comfortable during physical activities. Look for shoes designed for the specific sports or activities youâll be participating in. Whether itâs running, basketball, or dancing, having the right shoes can enhance your performance and enjoyment while staying active. 3. Fashion and Self-Expression Your shoes are a way to show off your unique taste and sense of fashion. Whether you prefer sneakers, boots, or loafers, there are endless options to choose from to match your style. Look for shoes in colors or patterns that reflect your personality and make you feel confident. Expressing yourself through your footwear adds a fun and personal touch to your school wardrobe. 4. Durability and Longevity Over time, shoes can wear out and lose their support and cushioning, especially if you wear them every day. Investing in high-quality shoes made from durable materials ensures they last longer and provide better protection for your feet. Look for shoes with sturdy construction and quality materials that can withstand the demands of school life. Choosing durable shoes saves you money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements. 5. Support Local Businesses Local shoe stores provide personalized service and unique selections that you might not find in big chain stores. By shopping locally, youâre helping to support your community and the local economy. Plus, you might discover hidden gems and new favorite brands that you wouldnât have found otherwise. Prioritize Your Footwear for a Successful School Year As you gear up for the new school year, donât overlook the importance of prioritizing your footwear. From ensuring proper fit and support to expressing your personal style, the shoes you choose play a significant role in your comfort, confidence, and overall well-being. So, take the time to select footwear that not only feels great but also reflects your unique personality and style.

        "content": "A sessions court in Mumbai on Tuesday sentenced two former staffers of a salon chain to life imprisonment in the 2018 Kirti Vyas murder case. The body of the 28-year-old Kirti Vyas has not been found yet. The quantum of sentence of two convicts in the Kirti Vyas murder case was announced on Tuesday. In the hearing on Monday, the two were found guilty in Kirti Vyas murder case. ADVERTISEMENT Reports stated that Additional Sessions Judge MG Deshpande on Monday had held the convicts--Siddhesh Tamhankar and Khushi Sahjwani, his accomplice--guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence). Tamhankar and Sahjwani, who worked as account executives and managers at an Andheri salon chain, reported to Vyas, the financial manager, the investigation states. Vyas was allegedly killed after writing a memo to one of the accused about poor performance. Vyas disappeared on March 16, 2018. Her relatives reported her missing to the DB Marg police station after they were unable to locate her using CCTV footage from Grant Road and Mumbai Central railway stations. Vyas was last seen boarding the Virar-bound train at 9:11 am from Grant Road in Andheri, according to the report. According to the PTI report, the Kirti Vyas murder case was later handed to the Crime Branch, which nabbed Tamhankar and Sahjwani. Police solved the case by conducting DNA testing on blood recovered in a car related to one of the defendants and allegedly used in the Kirti Vyas murder case.",

        "content": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the countryâs eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoonâs shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon provinceâs capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governorâs residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. âEven before the typhoon hit, weâve transported relief goods in places near the typhoonâs expected path, so they were all ready,â Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , making it one of the worldâs most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

        "content": "On Thursday (23 May) Doncaster Council revealed the details of Gateway One, an office and retail building that was greenlit by the planning committee in January. The site will revolve around digital technology, with hopes to allow Doncaster to progress as a centre of excellence for Artificial Intelligence . Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Doncaster Free Press, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Local AI firm Automatic Analytics will become a founder member of the project, with several other businesses expected to take residence in the building. According to the council, the siteâs design will âenable businesses and entrepreneurs to co-locate with other likeminded businesses and industry leaders to collaborate, develop local supply chain opportunities, access local, regional, and national business support provision, and strengthen industry links with education and skills provision.â The Â£24 million building will be funded by the Town Deal which was granted to the council by central government. Town Deal funding in Doncaster has been earmarked for the councilâs Urban Masterplan, which aims to regenerate the city. Advertisement Advertisement Located on Trafford Way, the building will contribute to the transformation of the Gateway area. Trafford Court Offices, Wolseley Plumb Centre and a vacant retail unit will all be demolished to make way for the new site. Office space will span across five floors, with two commercial units on the ground floor which incorporate alfresco dining. An area of public open space will also be incorporated into the scheme, with the site being designed to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions. Advertisement Advertisement Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones , said: âOur city is rapidly becoming recognised for its industry expertise around Artificial Intelligence, and I am keen to build this momentum and drive forward our ambition to regenerate our city centre and develop our economy for the 21st century. âThis is an exciting time for Doncaster city centre, with work taking place across several key areas and I look forward to seeing businesses across the city and region take advantage of this state-of-the-art facility.â Work is expected to start on the site in early 2025, with completion expected in 2026.",

        "content": "Nyanga man sentenced for serial thefts from former employer, neighbours In a troubling case that has left a community on edge, a 28-year-old Nyanga man has been brought before the Nyanga Magistratesâ Court, facing three counts of theft. The suspect, who was previously employed as a domestic worker, has been accused of targeting his former employer and two other local residents. According to the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe, the accused was fired from his position on April 12th, 2024. The very next day, he allegedly returned to the complainantâs home while she was away at a funeral and stole a host of items, including three buckets of yams, three buckets of maize, and a bed cover. The suspect is also accused of stealing five chickens from the complainantâs fowl run. Upon the complainantâs return, she discovered that her doors had been left open, and the missing property was nowhere to be found. It was later reported that the accused had been seen selling the stolen goods. The suspectâs criminal activities did not end there. On April 29th and 30th, he is said to have dug up potatoes from the fields of two additional complainants, valued at a total of $96 USD. Thorough investigations by the authorities led to the recovery of five bags of the stolen potatoes and the eventual arrest of the suspect. The court found the accused guilty on all three counts of theft and sentenced him to a total of seven months in prison. Three months of the sentence were suspended, and an additional month was suspended on the condition of restitution. The remaining three months were further suspended, provided the suspect completes 105 hours of community service.",

        "content": "THIBAUT COURTOIS has been left out of the Belgium Euro 2024 squad as fans claimed that their âgolden generation turned bronzeâ. The Real Madrid goalkeeper, 32, has been capped 102 times for his country. But he will not be adding to that total this summer in Germany as he was the big-name omission from the squad. Courtois missed nearly the entire season due to a knee ligament injury. He then needed another operation on his knee in March when he had a setback but he did return to play four games earlier this month for LaLiga champions Madrid. Courtois threw his Belgium future into doubt after branding manager Domenico Tedesco a liar. He and his international gaffer had been at loggerheads after he was snubbed of the captaincy for their matches against Austria and Estonia last June following Eden Hazard's retirement. Courtois staggeringly accused both the Belgian Football Federation and Tedesco of not appreciating him. Then there was further controversy last month as Tedesco claimed that he had done everything in his power to ensure the crocked Courtois plays for the Red Devils again. But the former Chelsea stopper publicly took umbrage to that claim by responding to a post with his comments with three Pinocchio emojis. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Courtois made his Belgium debut in 2011 aged 19 and has gone on to make a further 101 appearances for his country. But he had confirmed way back in December that he would not be fit enough to represent his country in Germany. Meanwhile, the likes of Manchester Cityâs Kevin de Bruyne and Jeremy Doku are both in, along with ex-Premier League striker Romelu Lukaku and Arsenal winger Leandro Trossard. But the Courtois news was not the only shock as Tedesco announced his 25-man squad. Belgium also recalled Axel Witsel - that is despite the 35-year-old announcing his international retirement last year. Tedesco personally visited the Atletico Madrid defender to try and persuade him to return, and his words have done the trick. Witsel earned the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Meanwhile, the countryâs most-capped player Jan Vertonghen has also been named at the age of 36. Here is the 25-man squad for Euro 2024 in full: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal). However, another notable absentee is Fenerbahce's Michy Batshuayi. The former Chelsea and Crystal Palace forward, 30, has scored 27 goals in 55 caps. Belgium have under-achieved and failed to claim any silverware for the past decade after having a squad many had dubbed as the âGolden Generationâ. And upon seeing the squad announcement for this upcoming tournament, one fan commented: âGolden generation turned bronze...â Another said: âThey are not seeing the quarter finals.â âBelgium fell off,â said a third before a fourth added: âThey're just perfect for group stages exit.

        "description": "'I'm going to bomb you - not a love bomb this time, a real bomb.'",
        "content": "A grandma who split up with her 37-year-old husband is now a scam hunter and has revealed a conman threatened to send her a bomb. Iris Jones, 83, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, married Mohamed Ibrahim but says she was left thousands of pounds out of pocket by him. In a Facebook post written last week, she revealed she now hunts scam artists who fool women online. A man who claimed to be from the American air force working in Yemen got in contact with Iris. She said: âHe asked me to send him Â£2,740 and I asked him how do I send it over? Just to tease him â I like to taunt them now. âIt wasnât âhi honeyâ, or anything like that, when I asked him what his favourite food was I expected him to say hamburger, or hotdogs or popcorn â but it was rice. âI called him something I canât share online â and then he said âgive me your location, Iâm going to bomb you â not a love bomb this time, a real bombâ. âThere must be a conveyer belt in these places where there are all these scammers and gold diggers who have all these women lined up and they pass you from pillar to post. âThey donât think of you as a person â youâre just a name.â Since Iris has turned into a scam hunter she has offered tips as to how to spot scammers. She added: âUsually they send a very handsome picture of themselves, often working on an oil rig or in another country or in the army. âThese pictures are not them â they are are pictures of genuine men and I think some of them know they are being used. âAlso, a lot of the time they want to come off Facebook, or the dating app or Facebook dating site and then want to go onto WhatsApp because âit is more privateâ. âThat is a red flag. âI am on scam alert and I would recommend it for people too as they tell you what to look out for. âThen there is the love bombing â after a couple of days of messaging they tell you they love you, and they are narcissists. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video âOften they use broken English â and they always ask you âhow was your day, how was your night, what have you had to eat, howâs the familyâ. âWhen they ask you to send money they will always tell you to keep it a secret and not go to the bank.â Iris previously hit out at Mohamed who claimed she used him as a âsex slaveâ.

Half term is here and the summer holidays is just on the horizon, so I wanted to share my one top tip for affordable days out with the family, one that has saved both my pocket and my sanity some days - it is a National Trust membership . In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, youâre sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a âspecial occasionâ. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and itâs much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs Â£13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just Â£8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and itâs more than paid for itself, visit more and youâre quids in. Did you know with a Digital Subscription to Edinburgh News, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Membership offers unlimited free admission to over 200 historic houses and gardens in England , Wales and Northern Ireland so you could effectively go to one every day if you felt so compelled. Packing up a picnic rather than eating out will also save you a few quid and the outdoor spaces at National Trust properties always offer a scenic place to picnic. Over the holidays, most places also lay on some kind of added entertainment for kids including trails and fun activities. This May half term, whether you want to delve into history at a castle or historic house or discover nature at parks and gardens, there are plenty of events to encourage imaginations to run wild. For example, you can create butterfly art at Chirk Castle in Wrexham, take in a falconry display at Trerice in Cornwall or help Squirrel Holmes solve the nature clues at Lyveden in Northamptonshire. You could even give the wheel of destiny a whirl at Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire to become a new character â will you be the Victorian statesman Benjamin Disraeli, an ice house attendant or a woodland bodger? To search for half-term events near you, from storytelling and quests to family trails and historical costume demonstrations, visit the National Trust website where you can also join the NT gang ! What I love the most about our membership is when weâre all starting to get cabin fever this summer, and feel like we're about to climb the walls, we can just head out. And we get to choose from some of the most beautiful properties and gardens in the country - what better place to enjoy an impromptu sandwich on the lawn?",

By casting your vote in favour of the lotus symbol, bring a âjan sevakâ to rule the state in place of an officer,â he said, in an apparent reference to Patnaikâs close aide and BJD leader Kartik Pandian. Stating that lakhs of youths were migrating to other states in search of work, the home minister said: âOnce the BJP forms government in Odisha, we will set up industries so that youths donât have to look for jobs elsewhere.â He also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing free 5 kg of rice to the people of Odisha and criticised Patnaik for distributing the rice in jute bags with his photographs. âPM Modiâs government is âchawal wali sarkarâ, while Naveen Patnaikâs government is âjhole wali sarkarâ,â Shah added.

        "content": "The popular face of Malayalam cinema, Maniyanpilla Raju is back again as a producer for the movie âGuâ. The veteran actor with an envious 49-year career in cinema was talking with Kaumudi movies as part of the promotion work of the movie when he cleared the air about not acting alongside actor Mohanlal for the past 13 years. Mohanlal and Maniyanpilla Raju are school friends and still carry the bonhomie. Maniyanpilla Raju: âIt has been long 13 years since I shared the screen with Lal. We talk with each other daily and share jokes. But It hasnât chanced upon me to ask for a role in his next films. There are friends among us who request Lal for roles in his next movie. Being Lal, it is normal for him to not turn anyone down and those people will be there in some roles in Lal's movies. But I believe that roles come to us if it is fit for us to perform. There is no point in pestering someone for roles. Just see for the fact that I am acting alongside Lal in Tharun Moorthyâs movie. A great role to play. See, these roles come to us, and I believe in destiny more than anything. â",

        "content": "ARE you a true foodie? There are 50 signs you know your stuff in the kitchen, from avoiding ready meals to doing your own recipes. Can you pronounce quinoa correctly? Have you any idea how to cook jackfruit? Know what is meant by to coddle something? If you think you can spot a Michelin-star meal when you eat one, why not put your money where your mouth is and give this quiz a try? It comes after research of 2,000 adults found 41 per cent are self-confessed foodies. Natalie Allen, spokesperson for salad brand Florette, which commissioned the research to launch its Gourmet Slaws range, said: âThe term âfoodieâ has been more widely used in recent years. âPeople make plans around which restaurants they are going to, often several weeks in advance and love to share their meals, recipes, reviews and general thoughts on food on social media platforms. âCuisine brings so much joy. When we think of special occasions such as birthdays and weddings or even holidays, the majority of them have an enjoyment of food at the heart of them. âDishes from around the world have progressively been integrated into our diet in the UK as we have become more inquisitive, experimental and so willing to try different and more âexoticâ options.â The research also identified the 50 signs someone is a foodie â and they include the kitchen being a favourite room in the house and a tendency to plan holidays around cuisine. Knowing how to make pasta from scratch, actually using the cookbooks they own and having in excess of 30 spices in the cupboard. Owning a set of chef-worthy knives, obsessively reading food blogs, knowing where different cuts of meat come from, eating seasonal produce and hosting dinner parties are further traits. Along with a fondness for dining in Michelin-star restaurants, seeking out independent eateries, and attending food festivals. Of those polled, seven in 10 are passionate about supporting Britainâs food and drink industry. As a result, 58 per cent try to eat in independent restaurants where possible because the food tastes better (42 per cent) and for an authentic experience (36 per cent). It also emerged adults typically eat out twice a month, spending an average of Â£40 on food and drinks. When dining out, 55 per cent try new meals each time while 18 per cent stick to what they know and love. Similarly, six in 10 claim they are adventurous with food and 24 per cent are willing to travel hundreds of miles for the âperfectâ meal. For 34 per cent, eating out at high class restaurants is their idea of fun, while 45 per cent enjoy learning new things about ingredients and meals. While the best aspects of dining out were found to be the satisfaction of eating a good meal (25 per cent), not having to cook (24 per cent) and trying new foods (15 per cent). More than a fifth (23 per cent) even have a list of restaurants theyâd like to visit, while 29 per cent have a wish list of countries to travel to specifically for the cuisine. When it comes to cooking, 41 per cent describe their ability as âaverageâ, while 38 per cent claim itâs âgoodâ and seven per cent go as far as saying itâs âexcellentâ. But despite many believing they themselves are a foodie, the research, carried out through OnePoll, found 29 per cent dislike the term as it's pretentious (66 per cent) and elitist (18 per cent). Natalie Allen, spokesperson for Florette's Gourmet Slaws, which are inspired by flavours of Korea, China and India, added: âWith summer fast approaching itâs likely social gatherings will revolve around food even more, from barbeques to al fresco lunches and late evening dining as the sun sets.â To take the quiz click here . 1.

        "content": "Testimony continues Tuesday in the murder trial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of hitting her boyfriend with an SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm. Read, 44, of Mansfield, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and other charges. The prosecution says she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe , with her black SUV outside of a home at 34 Fairview Road in Canton during a snowstorm on Jan. 29, 2022, following a night of drinking . Her defense plans to argue that someone else is responsible for killing O'Keefe. The defense is set to continue its cross-examination of ATF Agent Brian Higgins, one of three men Read's defense lawyers have implicated in O'Keefe's death. On Friday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally asked about flirty text messages, which were exchanged a few weeks before O'Keefe died. \"You're, hot,\" Read wrote to Higgins in one of the messages. \"Are you serious or messing with me?\" Higgins replied. \"No, I'm serious,\" Read wrote. \"Feeling is mutual. Is that bad? How long have you thought that?\" Higgins asks.

trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence Higgins testified that one day when he was leaving O'Keefe's house, Read \"planted a kiss on me. Not like a friend,\" adding that he interpreted it as romantic. In another exchange, Higgins read a message from Read in which she invited him to her house. \"I'm glad you came over tonight,\" Read later texts. Higgins said he asked Read in one message if she and OâKeefe were breaking up, to which Read replied, âI donât know. He hooked up (with) another girl on vacation.â Read eventually went over Higgins house, where the pair continued to discuss their interactions, Higgins testified. \"I am not proud of these text messages. It is what it is. I take responsibility for them,\" Higgins told the court. \"John was a friend at the same time. If they were at the end of their relationship, they were at the end of their relationship. But I was not going to have someone utilize me, weaponize me against someone I liked.\" Defense attorney Alan Jackson started his cross-examination Friday by questioning Higgins about his \"romantic interest\" in Read. \"I was physically attracted to her, yes,\" Higgins said. Higgins was cross-examined by Jackson about his phone records and movements within the Canton Police Department. Jackson sought to imply that Higgins had conversations with Brian Albert hours before O'Keefe's body was found and suggest that Higgins had access to Read's SUV and other evidence. Prosecutors are trying to show that Readâs actions were intentional. Read's lawyers have alleged there was a cover-up involving members of several law enforcement agencies. They say OâKeefe was beaten by someone else inside the home, bitten by a dog and then left outside. They argued investigators focused on Read because she was a \"convenient outsider,\" and that prevented them from considering other suspects. The defense is trying to convince the jury that O'Keefe was beaten and argues that Colin Albert had been in a fight. Albert said the injury came when he fell in a driveway and that he never saw O'Keefe on the night in question. He was in high school at the time, but previously testified that he was drinking beer at a friend's house before going to 34 Fairview Road to celebrate his cousin's birthday. Albert is the nephew of the couple that owned the Canton property where O'Keefe was found in January 2022. He also confirmed on cross-examination that he has known the lead state police investigator in this case, Trooper Michael Proctor, since he was a child. Another man that the defense has tried to implicate in the death is ATF Agent Brian Higgins, who testified about a \"romantic\" encounter and series of text messages he exchanged with Read. In those flirty messages, Read told him that O'Keefe had \"hooked up\" with another woman during a vacation. The trial's first few days detailed the futile efforts of first responders to save O'Keefe. They found him face up when they arrived just before dawn on Jan. 29. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, and an autopsy later found he died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. Several of the first responders said they heard Read make statements, including, \"I hit him,\" after O'Keefe was found. Defense attorneys confronted several of those witnesses by asking why those alleged remarks were not included in official reports. Officers also testified about unusual procedures used during the investigation, including the decision to collect bloody snow in red plastic cups and clearing snow from the crime scene.",

        "content": "Older voters have been promised an even bigger guarantee of their income, with the âtriple lock plusâ coming in if the Tories stay in power. It sounds like a complicated contraption making it very hard to open a door, but itâs a metaphor meaning state pensions will keep their value in real terms, no matter what is happening in the economy . The âtriple lockâ was introduced in 2010 , when the Tory/Lib Dem coalition came to power, and means that the annual increase in state pension will be based on whichever is highest of three values: inflation, the average increase in UK wages, or 2.5% at minimum. Unsurprisingly popular with pensioners, the policy has nonetheless been criticised by others who say it is unsustainable with an ageing population. Rishi Sunak now plans to beef it up even further with an added promise that pensioners will get to keep more of their income than other age groups before it is taxed. He said he would increase the personal allowance for those of pension age, while keeping it frozen for working-age adults, meaning that the full state pension would not risk falling into tax no matter how much it went up.

The personal allowance of income earned tax-free is the first Â£12,570 as standard for everyone, except those earning over Â£125,140 who arenât entitled to it. Currently, the full state pension is Â£11,502 a year, so approaching the taxable level if it kept on increasing while personal allowance remained frozen. Rishi Sunak said that if he wins the General Election on July 4, personal allowance would also rise by the triple-lock tests, for pensioners only. So their tax-free earnings allowance would increase by at least 2.5% each year, and possibly much more, always keeping pace with pensions. While some dubbed this the âquadruple lockâ, the government settled on âtriple lock plusâ. Itâs a bit of a mouthful especially if you werenât even sure about the original triple lock, but you can expect to hear that term a lot more over the coming weeks. The policy would amount to a tax break of Â£95 in 2025-26, rising to Â£275 in 2029-30. By 2029/2030, it would cost Â£2.4 billion a year and the government said it would be funded through clamping down on tax dodgers â the same pot of money which will help pay for mandatory National Service for teenagers , another flagship Tory election policy. Under the Conservatives, the State Pension had risen by AÌÂ£3,700 â and is increasing another AÌÂ£900 this year. We introduced the Triple Lock. Now weaÌÂÂre introducing the Triple Lock Plus Ã°ÂÂÂ https://t.co/KMc01VYNRc It means a guarantee in legislation that the pensionersâ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the new state pension. But Labour said it was a âdesperate moveâ from a party which was âtorchingâ what was left of its claims to economic credibility, and they wouldnât be offering it themselves. Positioning himself as financially responsible, Keir Starmer had a boost this morning as dozens of business leaders signed an open letter endorsing the partyâs economic plans. Announcing the pensions policy, Mr Sunak said: âThanks to the Conservativesâ triple lock, pensions have risen by Â£900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around Â£100 next year. âThis bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.â It is a regular payment from the government which most people can claim when they reach a certain age: currently 66 years old for both men and women. Not everyone gets the same amount, as how much you get depends on your National Insurance contributions while working. The full amount is currently Â£221.20 per week under the system from 2016. Many pensioners will also rely on income from other sources, such as private workplace pensions. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson pointed out that about half the cost of the plan was from not imposing three more years of frozen personal allowances on pensioners.

Meanwhile, Sam Bidwell of free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute said: âThe state pension could be financially unsustainable as soon as 2035, a worrying trend which this policy will only exacerbate.

        "content": "More than 10,000 applications to become cabin crew flying were made in the first week of the jobs being advertised. Airline TUI has said there was âunprecedented interestâ in the roles, which will see 41 new staff flying out of Glasgow airport. The air crews have undergone months of âgruellingâ training and will now be deployed on the travel companyâs flights from Scotlandâs largest city. In addition, four extra pilots have begun working at the Scottish hub. The air crews get their 'wings' (Image: TUI) TUIâs Head of Cabin Crew Management Ian Campbell said: âThis year we saw unprecedented interest, with thousands applying for the roles available; and 10,000 applications flying in during the first week.â The majority of the training takes place at TUIâs Training Centre in East Midlands, where the new recruits are put through their paces and learn safety and service.

        "content": "Attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), has called on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Judicial Council to initiate a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to avoid conflicts with national courts. He said the review should make the court realise its envisioned potential as a respectable regional court. Fagbemi, who addressed the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the ECOWAS Judicial Council in Abuja, said the council should also provide a credible network for the promotion of uniform rules of practice and procedure in the administration of justice in order to reduce conflict of laws in the region. He said the ECOWAS Judicial Council stands in a proper position to work towards the promotion of rule of law and democratic governance, which have come under intense pressure in recent times. According to Fagbemi, as the ECOWAS bloc continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind. He said the challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the West African states are identical in terms of judicial autonomy, provision of funding and infrastructural facilities for the courts, among others. In the same vein, he said member states also share the challenges confronting the region in terms of economy, migration, integration, insecurity, enforcement of fundamental rights. The AGF enjoined the ECOWAS Judicial Council to utilise the regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to address the issues in order to achieve greater independence of the judiciary and a more prosperous and safer sub-region. Earlier, the chairman of the ECOWAS Judicial Council and the chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, said the council is working towards ensuring a just and equitable society. He charged member states to work towards safeguarding the principles of justice, upholding the rule of law, and advancing the cause of peace and prosperity. In his speech, the president of the Community Court of Justice, Eward Amoako Asante, restated the commitment of ECOWAS Judicial Council to upholding the principles of justice, equity and the rule of law within the ECOWAS Community. Since its inception, he said, the ECOWAS Court has served as a beacon of hope for the people of West Africa, providing a platform for the resolution of disputes and the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights.",

        "content": "Ever since coming into the NBA last year, Victor Wembanyama has silenced his doubters with all kinds of magnificent displays. However, the youngsterâs desire to prove his worth has always carried the risk of going too far. And sure enough, one such instance occurred recently when the San Antonio Spurs star called out one of his trolls for doubting his capabilities. The situation circled a 187-week-old Instagram post by an account , highlighting the prowess of a 16-year-old Wemby. At that time, a different fan had raised question marks over the then teenagerâs ability in the comments, stating, âHe not gone do none of that in the NBAâ. Evidently, it caught the eyes of the Spurs rookie at least a few days ago, prompting him to hit back at the doubter, declaring, âWhy not?â. This hilarious instance caught the eyes of the NBA followers. Consequently, a fan account named YKB uploaded a screenshot of the exchange on X (formerly Twitter), with the caption, âWemby cooked that manâ. This yet again provided a glimpse into his competitive mindset as a youngster. After turning the heads of the critics with his on-court displays, Wemby is now likely on a mission to ensure the same with his off-court antics. So, the 20-year-old probably didnât think much of it while responding to a comment that is over three years old. Additionally, during those years, the Frenchman didnât have a CV to highlight his worth to the world. This is likely why, he chose to remain level-headed back in those times, focusing entirely on the craft. But now, the tables have turned. Victor Wembanyama can now back his words with actions Shortly after entering the NBA, his high ceiling as a basketball player became evident to the world. After initially struggling a bit to adapt to the conditions of the league, the rookie rose through the ranks quickly. As a result, by the end of the regular season, Wemby won over his doubters while injecting fear into the hearts of his opponents. His impressive rookie season stat line reflected precisely this. Despite averaging just 29.7 minutes on the court, the Spurs star recorded 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.2 steals, and 3.6 blocks per game. These majestic displays also earned him the 2024 ROTY accolade while keeping him in the conversation for the DPOY award throughout the campaign. These achievements hint at how Wemby will remain one of the frontrunners to become the face of the NBA in the coming years. After all, considering how brilliant his performances are already, that day may not be too far in the future.",

        "content": "Lily Allen uses a kidsâ phone to reduce the time spent on social media â and itâs something you can do too. The British singer and actor revealed in an interview with the Sunday Times , that she and her husband, David Harbour , use a system on their phone called Pinwheel that has no browsing capability and no social media , but has other apps such as Uber and Spotify. She explains that smartphones have âdestroyedâ humanity âas a speciesâ and says the devices have had a grievous impact on her creativity. She said: âThe creative side of my brain has been ruined by smartphones. âI feel like everyone feels the same. I donât know anyone who can possibly say that the quality of their life is improved by the presence of a smartphone. âI think itâs destroyed us as a species. Itâs horrendous that theyâre designed to be so addictive. Some of us have more addictive personalities than others. Itâs evil.â Previously in 2019, Lily Allen announced that she is giving up her smartphone because she spends seven hours a day looking at it. In a live video at the time, the 39-year-old said: âIâm done with this dead a**e app and Twitter and email and WhatsApp. All of it can go and suck its mumâs... I just wanted to let you know that. âI care about the world and I care about creating things and I donât really care about the validation that comes back any more.â Ms Allen uses an operating system attached to certain smartphones called Pinwheel, which allows users to have the functions of a smartphone but without the internet or social media. So if youâre looking to follow in Lily Allenâs steps, there are a few basic phones you should consider. The Light Phone is a minimal phone that also does not have social media or a browser, but does have maps and podcasts and it can hotspot. This is a great alternative if youâre looking for a way to ween yourself off using social media without letting go of all the practical functions a smartphone has. To use the phone in the UK, you would need the international version, which is compatible with carriers Vodafone, 3, and Giff Gaff. The Light phone requires a nano SIM card, which is the same size an iPhone uses. The international Light Phone is available to buy in the UK, and will cost Â£235, or it can be bought on eBay. The Pinwheel phone is a real smartphone that has Pinwheel OS installed which allows parents or caregivers to control what is on the phone. It is not an app, but an operating system that disables social media and internet browsers to allow certain apps to feature on the phone. Going back to basics, but miss the practical keyboard of a smartphone? You may want to try the Blackberry at a cool Â£25 on eBay. Taking it back to the late 2000s, the Blackberry is a great choice that has standard features, but with limited apps. However, it should be noted that the Blackberry uses a mini SIM, which is bigger than the nano SIM cards used by Apple. This phone also allows you to browse the web and check your emails, but mindlessly scrolling on your feed may be a bit more difficult. If youâre ready to go completely cold turkey, you may want to consider a Doro 2404 at around Â£50. Its large screen with 90s buttons means itâs great for those who are partially-sighted or just prone to forgetting glasses, or if youâre just tired of the smaller keyboards on some smartphones. The flip phone is created for senior citizens, but has all the basics youâre looking for, such as calls, texting, weather, and even a camera, plus FM radio, a calculator, and games. However, it should be noted these phone needs a micro SIM card. This will be a massive change from using an iPhone but is way more sturdy than an one too. If youâre looking for that satisfying slam that you can only get with a flip phone, but want something more stylish than the Doro, you might want to consider the Motorola RAZR, available on eBay for as little as Â£50? This phone is an echo of those teenage days where having a phone was cool â but it also allows you to take a little breather from social media without compromising on style. The phone requires a mini SIM card to run, which is slightly bigger those ones used in iPhones. Simple. Elegant. Understated. If youâre looking for something that just allows the basics, and can be droppedwithout too much damage, this phone is going for as cheap as Â£15.99 on eBay. What more is there to say â other than it also takes a mini SIM. With a tagline of âdesigned to be used lessâ, the Boring Phone 2 can be set up to have no internet browser, social media, mobile games or application store. Getting a tattoo could trigger blood cancer Major outage leaves thousands of customers unable to access banking app Cases of most deadly skin cancer soar to an all-time high Innocent woman branded a thief by AI facial recognition software However, it can have data messaging, voice and video calling which means you donât need to give up the smart from a smartphone. However, this phone is not yet available, and is currently on a waitlist, which may be a good way to weigh up your options in whether youâre ready to give up your phone as it is now. The Nokia 3310 is not quite a brick phone, but still lasts (almost) forever. It comes in four vibrant shades and is a fun alternative to a smartphone, while still expressing your individuality. The phone can do the basics, includes retro games like Snake, and requires a micro SIM to work. Available now for Â£59.99, itâs just the product to try if you want to ditch a smartphone.

        "description": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai investasi sumber daya manusia, seringkali anak usia dini kurang disinggung dibandingkan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama",
        "content": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai , seringkali kurang disinggung jika dibandingkan dengan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama sering juga disebut sebagai periode kritis atau bahkan disebut sebagai usia emas ( ). ECED Ecosystem Development Lead Tanoto Foundation, Fitriana Herarti mengatakan tidak semua orang memiliki pemahaman yang sama mengenai usia emas. Secara umum, usia emas menggambarkan periode usia tiga tahun pertama kehidupan. âPada usia tersebut, tumbuh kembang anak berlangsung dengan sangat pesat, yang tidak akan terulang lagi pada periode selanjutnya. Pesatnya tumbuh kembang ini didasarkan dari hasil riset ilmu saraf dan perilaku selama beberapa dekade yang menghasilkan sejumlah fakta penting,â kata Fitriana, Selasa (28/5). Pertama, perkembangan otak dimulai sejak masa kehamilan hingga mencapai 80% di usia tiga tahun yang kemudian akan menjadi fondasi untuk semua capaian belajar, kesehatan, dan perilaku di periode usia selanjutnya. Kedua, interaksi dua arah (serve and return) antara orang tua atau pengasuh utama dengan anak menjadi kunci perkembangan otak yang optimal. Sebaliknya interaksi yang negatif justru akan menjadi penghambat. Ketiga, kapasitas otak untuk berkembang akan menurun dengan bertambahnya usia. Lebih efektif untuk mempengaruhi perkembangan otak pada usia dini daripada mengembangkan kapasitas otak di kelompok usia lainnya. Keempat, kesehatan mental dan fisik, keterampilan sosial, kemampuan berpikir, dan bahasa yang berkembang di usia dini akan menjadi fondasi yang kuat untuk anak supaya bisa mendapatkan hasil pembelajaran yang optimal, sukses di dunia kerja, dan memiliki kemampuan sosial yang baik. Kelima, pengalaman negatif anak di usia dini, misal mengalami kekerasan, pengabaian, maupun tidak terpenuhinya kebutuhan kesehatan dan gizi akan menghambat optimalisasi perkembangan otak. âBerbagai fakta tentang perkembangan otak tersebut menjadi sebab pentingnya keterlibatan aktif dan kapasitas yang memadai dari orang tua. Pengasuhan tidak lagi cukup didasari oleh insting ataupun meniru bagaimana dulu orang tua diasuh, terlebih karena anak usia dini memiliki kebutuhan spesifik yang berbeda dengan kelompok usia lainnya,â jelas Fitriana. Karena itu, pengasuhan di periode tiga tahun pertama, harus memastikan anak mendapatkan sejumlah hal, yang meliputi kesehatan yang baik, termasuk menerima semua imunisasi wajib, kebiasaan hidup bersih dan sehat sehingga anak terhindar dari infeksi berulang, misal diare, malaria, cacingan, campak, cacar, dll. Hal lainnya adalah Gizi yang mencukupi dengan memberikan Inisiasi Menyusu Dini (IMD), enam bulan ASI Eksklusif, Makanan Pendamping ASI (MP-ASI) bergizi seimbang mulai usia enam bulan, dan ASI hingga dua tahun. Selanjutnya, anak harus memperoleh pola asuh yang responsif, yaitu memberikan pengasuhan yang tanggap terhadap kebutuhan anak untuk mendapatkan kasih sayang, interaksi dua arah yang cukup, dan mampu mengenali perilaku-perilaku anak saat merasa tidak nyaman. Pada usia tersebut, anak-anak juga harus mendapatkan kesempatan untuk belajar pada anak usia dini melalui bermain dan interaksi sehari-hari dengan orang-orang, anak lain, dan lingkungan di sekitar anak. Terakhir adalah keamanan dan keselamatan, yakni memastikan anak berada dalam lingkungan yang aman, bebas kekerasan, terhindar dari ancaman kemiskinan yang mengakibatkan kebutuhan dasar anak tidak terpenuhi, serta penerapan disiplin positif dalam membentuk perilaku anak. Fitriana menjelaskan dari hasil studi yang dilakukan oleh Tanoto Foundation selama satu tahun kepada kelompok orangtua dengan anak usia 0-3 tahun di Jakarta, Pandeglang dan Kutai Kartanegara, diketahui bahwa orangtua yang menerima pelatihan dan pendampingan untuk meningkatkan keterampilan pengasuhan di 5 komponen di atas mampu membantu anak-anak mereka untuk mencapai peningkatan kemampuan di aspek berpikir, bahasa, motorik, dan sosial-emosional lebih dari anak-anak dari orangtua yang tidak mendapatkan pelatihan atau pendampingan. Hal ini menunjukkan betapa pentingnya pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan pengasuhan orangtua untuk pertumbuhan dan perkembangan anak usia dini, dan juga masih banyak orang tua yang belum memiliki pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan untuk melakukan pengasuhan yang baik, responsif dan cukup bagi anak-anak mereka di usia 0 hingga 3 tahun. âStudi ini juga menguji kualitas pengasuhan anak di rumah melalui instrument HOME (Home Observation for Measuring the Environment). Pada kelompok intervensi, peningkatan besar terlihat pada beberapa aspek utama pengasuhan anak, yaitu responsivitas dalam memenuhi kebutuhan dasar anak, pengelolaan kegiatan sehari-hari anak, ketersedian dan variasi bahan-bahan untuk belajar melalui bermain, serta keterikatan emosional anak dengan orangtuanya, dibandingkan dengan kelompok non-intervensi,â jelas Fitriana. Pengetahuan dan keterampilan mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini juga penting untuk dipahami oleh para pengelola layanan pengasuhan sementara saat orangtua bekerja. Oleh karena itu Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Perlindungan Anak (Kementerian PPPA) pada 29-30 April 2024 menyelenggarakan bimbingan teknis kepada pengelola dan pengasuh Taman Asuh Ramah Anak (tempat pengasuhan sementara di jam kerja) dari 22 Kementerian/Lembaga, dan meminta Tanoto Foundation menyampaikan materi mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini. Dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara penting untuk memastikan bahwa pengasuh memiliki pengetahuan tentang tumbuh kembang anak usia dini agar mampu memberikan stimulasi atau rangsangan perkembangan yang sesuai usia anak, menggunakan disiplin positif dalam mengelola perilaku anak, serta memahami penerapan gizi seimbang untuk konsumsi anak selama berada di tempat pengasuhan sementara. Selain sebagai narasumber dalam bimbingan teknis ini, Tanoto Foundation juga sebagai anggota komite teknis perwakilan ahli pengasuhan dalam penyusunan SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) Taman Asuh Ramah Anak. Salah satu standar layanan yang harus ada adalah kegiatan stimulasi perkembangan sesuai usia anak menjadi bagian dari kegiatan sehari-hari anak selama berada dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara.

The shooting occurred at around 3am on Saturday when Wactor approached three men, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Officers are pictured at the scene Three suspects drove away from the scene, police (pictured at the scene) said. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. There were no arrests as of late on Sunday. Wactor's murder comes just weeks after California was ranked among the top 10 most dangerous states in America. Violent crime in Los Angeles has been on the rise, with the LAPD recording a 2.9 per cent increase at the end of March 2024, compared to the same time last year. The LAPD reported Friday that, as of the end of April, the city's rise in the number of murders in 2024 continued to decline and, as of April 27, was only 4.2 per cent above the number of murders reported at this time in 2023, NBC Los Angeles reported. The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 per cent, according to ABC 7. Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year. Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace.

        "content": "MAURICIO POCHETTINO remains the favourite to be the next Manchester United manager. The former Spurs and Chelsea manager - who left his role at Stamford Bridge last week -leads the race to take over from Erik ten Hag . But after United finished the season with somewhat of a flourish, are they in the market for a new manager this summer? That's the question for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co, who witnessed the FA Cup win at Wembley and saw the respect Ten Hag had from the players and supporters after beating Manchester City. Wins over Newcastle and Brighton preceded it too. So is binning the Dutchman the right thing to do? Paddy Power make it 6/4 that he remains at Old Trafford next season and as low as 4/9 that he's replaced. So with it more likely he'll be gone, we look at the top candidates seemingly strongly in contention with the bookmakers. It's always appeared destined that Pochettino would be in charge at Old Trafford one day. The unfortunate thing for him and the club, it's just never appeared to be the right time. He was a strong, strong favourite prior to Ten Hag's appointment and he's always been into a project when the opportunity has arisen. Reports suggest INEOS hold him in 'high esteem' having tried to land him for Nice a couple of years ago which never materialised. Odds continue to plummet. Stellar time at Brighton but is on the move this summer. Disappointing domestic campaign as they struggle to balance the league and European football but style of football a huge plus. Had been linked with Chelsea and Bayern but they both look to be heading in different directions. So that doesn't leave too many more options at the top end. Played United in final game of the season at the Amex as Brighton boss. Was the 2-0 defeat a good audition? Tuchel had attracted most of the money in recent weeks following the news he'd be quitting Bayern in the summer. He lost out comfortably in the Bundesliga race - finishing a disappointing third in the end - and guided them to the semi finals of the Champions League . Has Premier League experience having coached Chelsea , guiding them to European glory too. He won 63 of his 100 games in charge of the club. Also played United twice earlier in the season, winning both home and away in Champions League group stage fixtures. Odds on the drift and now third favourite after being a short price at the start of the month. The Ipswich boss was seemingly well in contention for both the Chelsea and Brighton roles, though that has changed over the weekend. Odds shortened all week in this market and a return to United looked to be on the cards at one stage. His style of play at Ipswich was one thing but back-to-back promotions from League One to the Premier League has shown he's a winner and puts him in the shop window for a host of top clubs. Will that past work at United help or hinder his chances? Who knows. Odds on the drift. Southgate's name was thrown into the mix earlier on this year and he's remained strong in the betting markets since. The England boss was reportedly the number one choice of Sir Jim Ratcliffe during his takeover process, with new technical director Jason Wilcox also a fan. Southgate's potential appointment is said to be universally welcome by those in the club, including the United players. His contract with the FA runs out in December of this year, meaning this summer's Euros could be his last in charge - after shelving talks on his future until after the tournament. Regardless of the outcome, he could look to leave on a high should England finally get over the line, or admit defeat and hand the reins to someone else should they disappoint on the continental stage yet again. Either way, he could be looking for a fresh challenge after the summer and Old Trafford could present itself nicely. He's also worked with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth at the FA, which also sways things in his favour. Paddy Power prices Earlier on this calendar year after a sticky spell for Ten Hag, it was GRAHAM POTTER (14/1) who dominated this particular market in the early parts of the season. Potter, who also has previous of working with Dan Ashworth at Brighton, has remained out of work since his sacking from Chelsea at the beginning of last year though has been linked with several top flight roles. Has met owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and no surprises should his odds be shortened still, though is reportedly being lined up for Brighton return. THOMAS FRANK (14/1) saw considerable support last week but his odds have drifted slightly following the events of the last week. The Dane revealed he was really happy at Brentford just a few days ago but could the lure of United take him away if they came calling?

        "content": "By Our Bureau Comments READ LATER With only 0.09 per cent of the population registered as stem cell donors, there is a need for more people to join the stem cell registry, says DKMS BMST Foundation India, pointing to the severe shortage of donors. Patrick Paul, Chief Executive with the Foundation said, âIn India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants. We need to expand our donor database significantly, to provide these patients a fighting chance.â His words come against the backdrop of World Blood Cancer Day (May 28). DKMS-BMST is a joint venture of two non-profit organisations, BMST (Bangalore Medical Services Trust) and DKMS, one of the largest international blood stem cell donor centres in the world, a note from the Foundation said. The representatives urged healthy people between 18 â 55 years to register and volunteer to become a stem cell donor. Over a lakh people from India are diagnosed annually with blood cancer and disorders such as thalassemia and aplastic anemia, a note from the Foundation said. âFor many of these patients, a blood stem cell transplant is their only hope for survival. While conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is often crucial for patients who are at high risk of relapse or who do not respond well to conventional treatments,â it added. Dr Nitin Agarwal, Head of Donor Request Management at the Foundation, pointed out that many people in India are unaware of what blood stem cell donation involves or have incorrect beliefs about the process. âItâs crucial to understand that matching for stem cell transplants, is based on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) characteristics, not just blood type. Education is key to dispelling these misconceptions and encouraging more people to register,â he said. Comments",

Thousands of protesters are gathering in Taipei as opposition lawmakers attempt to pass controversial legislation that could curb President Lai Ching-teâs authority. What Happened : Thousands of demonstrators assembled in Taipei on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The protests erupted as opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) and its allies in the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) sought to pass a contentious bill. The legislation would grant them greater investigative powers, potentially undermining President Lai Ching-te . Violent shoving matches broke out inside the legislature, echoing the unrest outside. Protesters expressed fears that the new powers could derail President Lai's agenda and lead to leaks of sensitive information. The proposed changes would allow lawmakers to summon the president, companies, and the public for questioning, and access confidential documents. Last weekâs protests were among the largest since the 2014 Sunflower Movement, which saw demonstrators occupy parliament to block an unpopular trade pact with China. Inside the legislature, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers opposed the amendments, covering the chamber with placards and shouting slogans. See Also: Hereâs What To Expect If Donald Trump Is Convicted As Jury Deliberations Begin Next Week The KMT, advocating closer ties with China, denies any external influence on the law. KMT lawmaker Ko Chih-en stated the reform reflects public opinion. President Lai, who was sworn in on May 20, faces potential challenges in implementing policies amid the legislative turmoil. Why It Matters : The protests come shortly after President Lai was inaugurated as Taiwanâs new president on May 20. Laiâs presidency marks a significant period for Taiwan. The legislative push by the KMT and TPP is seen as an attempt to limit Laiâs influence early in his term. Adding to the tension, a senior U.S. lawmaker recently confirmed that Taiwanâs ordered weapons are on their way , amid escalating military tensions with China. This development underscores the geopolitical stakes involved in Taiwanâs internal politics and its relationship with major global powers. Read Next: Biden Vs.

This was the first time Nadal has exited the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, in the first round. Zverev won 6-3 ,7-6(5), 6-3. Zverev became the third player in the history of the sport to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, behind Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling. The 37-year-old southpaw opined that playing a Grand Slam (Wimbledon in this case) and the Olympics in quick succession wouldnât be smart on his part, especially given he has been struggling to cope up with injuries. âI canât confirm anything, but I donât think itâs smart after everything my body has been through,â he said. Nadal explained the reason behind thinking of skipping Wimbledon. âIt will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games,â he said. Nadal won Wimbledon twiceâin 2008 and 2010âbut also endured some of his toughest moments at the All England Club. He last played in the tournament in 2022, when he was forced to withdraw before his semifinal against Nick Kyrgios with an abdomen strain.",

        "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the . As the world is just getting over Covid-19 after four years, a top British scientist warned that another pandemic is âabsolutely inevitableâ. The former chief scientific adviser to the British government, Sir Patrick Vallance, urged the UK government to prioritise preparations for the pandemic and emphasized that the country is ânot readyâ for it yet, reported. According to the report, Vallance, speaking at a panel event at the Hay Festival in Powys, stressed that the UK government must implement âbetter surveillanceâ to detect the threats of the virus. He also recommended some measures to prevent drastic steps during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. The top scientist believes that such measures could be implemented, however, it would require some coordination. âWe know we have to have an army, not because there's going to be a war this year, but we know it's an important part of what we need as a nation. We need to treat this preparedness in the same way and not to view it as an easy thing to keep cutting back when there's no sign of a pandemic â because there won't be a sign of a pandemic,â he said, as quoted by The Guardian. According to the report, Vallance also said that by 2023, G7 had âsort of forgottenâ his points about the pandemic preparations in 2021. âYou can't forget about it,â he said. The British scientist, during the panel event, mentioned the World Organization's (WHO) pandemic accord, calling it a âpositive stepâ. However, he also criticised its âlack of focus and urgencyâ. Last week, the WHO said that Covid-19 has cut global life expectancy by almost two years, wiping out a decade of progress. According to the UN health agency's world health statistics study, global life expectancy fell 1.8 years to 71.4 years â the same level it was in 2012. The study said that the amount of time an average person can expect to live in good health fell 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the world.",

        "content": "The Senate and the House of Representatives will tomorrow hold a joint sitting to mark the 25 years of unbroken democracy/legislature in Nigeria.

        "content": "Michael Vi Nokia ( NYSE: NOK ) is set to secure a deal to supply 5G radio equipment to Portugal-based telecom operator MEO, Reuters reported, citing an internal company blog post and two people with knowledge of the matter. Nokia is geared up to secure the contract despite China's Huawei Technologies having being MEO's only supplier of 2G, 3G and 4G Radio Access Network, or RAN, equipment, the report added . The agreement has received a greenlight but has not yet been signed, and an announcement could be made as early as next month, as per the report. MEO, which was formerly known as Telecom Portugal and now a unit of France's Altice, is one of Portugal's leading mobile operators. \"In recent years, MEO ... has been supplied in RAN only by Huawei. In other words, Huawei has had a 100% market share in 2G/3G/4G. We have now been selected to replace Huawei in some of the key markets in Portugal,\" wrote Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia's mobile networks, in the internal company memo. The agreement would mark Nokia's return to Portugal's RAN market after it lost market share to Chinese tech giant Huawei several years ago and has not supplied any communications service providers with RAN in the nation since then, Uitto noted in the blog. RAN tools have generated the majority of telecom sales for companies such as Huawei, Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson ( ERIC ) ( OTCPK:ERIXF ), however a decline in demand for new tools from telcos since last year has impacted Nokia and Ericsson, pushing them to cut thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Huawei â which was banned in the U.S. and certain European countries over security concerns â still has some presence in the EU and is a major player in the telecom market in China.

        "content": "The owners of a Tayside farm have expressed their âutter contemptâ for the people who vandalised their property over the weekend, leaving 2000 bees dead. Police in the area are appealing for information after parts of Tofthill Farm in Inchyra were damaged in a vandalism incident. Officers say the damage must have taken place between 5pm on Friday 24 May, and 10 am on Saturday 25 May. Those responsible for the overnight attack have yet to be traced, after the damage left 2,000 bees dead and multiple fresh strawberry plants ruined. The owners of the farm have released a statement saying how disappointed they are with the attack on their property, especially after an âincredibly difficult winterâ and during a time when food production in Scotland is becoming harder every year. READ MORE: ScotGov plan to 'eradicate' hornet threatening Honeybees Scottish Bee Company honey praised by Nigella Lawson A spokesperson for the farm said: âWe are incredibly disappointed to be subjected to a vandalism at the weekend. Aside from jumping on our equipment and damaging it, the most heart-breaking aspect of it is that some 2,000 bees were killed and dozens of fresh strawberry plants were maliciously damaged. âBees are truly the most magnificent and efficient pollinators on any farm and itâs thanks to them that we all get fed. âAfter an incredibly difficult winter for farming, where it is getting harder and harder to produce food, we only have utter contempt for the individuals who have caused thousands of pounds worth of damageâ.

        "content": "On Tuesday, UBS has downgraded stock of Asahi Intecc Co Ltd (7747:JP) (OTC: AHICF) from Buy to Neutral, significantly lowering the price target to Â¥2,220 from the previous Â¥3,660. The revision reflects concerns over the anticipated slow progress in new U.S. market fields and the unlikely improvement in valuation multiples due to substantial quarterly sales volatility in China. According to UBS, the slower-than-expected ramp-up of Asahi Intecc's new fields in the U.S. is due to the prevalence of bundled marketing strategies by leading companies, which may hinder Asahi's market share growth. Consequently, the firm has adjusted its forecast for the operating profit before goodwill amortisation for the fiscal year ending June 2026 to Â¥26.9 billion, down from Â¥30.9 billion. This figure falls below the IFIS consensus of Â¥29.5 billion. In addition to the challenges in the U.S., Asahi Intecc's performance in China is also causing concern. Sales in China have been highly inconsistent, primarily due to the reliance on distributor-based marketing. This erratic sales pattern has led to a lack of earnings visibility, which UBS believes negatively impacts the company's valuation multiple. To align with these projections, UBS has also revised the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) estimate for Asahi Intecc, reducing it from 46.6X to a more conservative 29.6X. This adjustment is a direct reflection of the anticipated difficulties in the U.S. and China markets, which are key factors behind the lowered price target for the company's shares.

        "content": "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he is prepared to stay in his current role after the election and urged the country to choose stability over âchaosâ by voting for the African National Congress. âIf I am asked to serve I will serve,â he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Jennifer Zabasajja. âWhat these elections are about â are about stability and chaos â and the ANC provides that stability.â South Africans vote on Wednesday, with Godongwanaâs ruling ANC facing its toughest election fight since taking power in 1994. Opinion polls show ANC support dipping below 50%, which would force it into a coalition with a smaller rival. But recent rand strength suggests investors see it doing well enough to form a government without hooking up with parties to its left, which could push the country in a more populist and less market-friendly direction. Godongwana voiced confidence that the party will get over the line. âThe ANC is working on the assumption that weâre going to have 50 plus one.â",

        "content": "It is \"very unlikely\" more survivors of Papua New Guinea's deadly landslide will be found, a UN agency warned on Tuesday, as thousands at risk from further slips were ordered to evacuate. Some 2 000 people are feared buried by a massive landslide that entombed a remote highland community in the early hours of 24 May. Since then, locals have been picking through a hellscape of metres-deep churned-up earth, uprooted trees and car-sized boulders in the search for loved ones - often using little more than their hands, shovels and digging sticks. But hopes are dimming that anyone is alive underneath the mountain of rubble. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Unicef Papua New Guinea's Niels Kraaier told AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" READ | 'We are racing against time': Fears of another slide as 670 bodies found in Papua New Guinea Full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the remote location, the only road link being severed, heavy rainfall and nearby tribal violence. The Papua New Guinea Defence Forces have struggled to access the site with heavy earth-moving equipment. Early on Tuesday, Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka warned the disaster could worsen further, as clumps of limestone, dirt and rock continue to shear off the side of Mount Mungalo. Tsaka told AFP authorities were now trying to coordinate the evacuation of almost 7 900 more people. He said: \"Every hour you can hear rock breaking - it is like a bomb or gunshot and the rocks keep falling down.\" Aid officials said many residents were refusing to leave at-risk areas because they were holding out hope of finding loved ones. Satellite images show the enormous scale of the disaster. A vast smear of yellow and grey debris can be seen cutting through once verdant bushland and severing the region's only road. \"This was an area heavily populated with homes, businesses, churches and schools, it has been completely wiped out. It is the surface of the moon - it is just rocks,\" said Tsaka. \"People are digging with their hands and fingers,\" he said, expressing anguish at the under-resourced government's inability to meet the enormity of the disaster. \"I am not equipped to deal with this tragedy,\" Tsaka admitted. Overwhelmed Papua New Guinea authorities held an online emergency meeting with United Nations agencies and international allies Tuesday, hoping to kickstart the relief effort. Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre has told the United Nations that the initial \"landslide buried more than 2 000 people alive\". According to a letter obtained by AFP, the slide also \"caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country\". The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. Australia has announced millions of dollars' worth of aid, including emergency relief supplies such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden - more accustomed to scrapping for influence in the strategically located country - both offered assistance. More than 1 000 people have already been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth said up to 30 000 people could have been cut off by the disaster across several villages. These communities had enough supplies for the coming weeks, but opening up that road remained essential, he said. \"This landslide has blocked the road westward, so not only are there challenges in accessing the village itself, but it does mean the communities beyond that are also cut off.\" Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The estimated death toll has climbed significantly since the disaster struck, as officials reassess the size of the population. Many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years. The area is located about 600km from Port Moresby.",

        "content": "LAGOS â Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, the Chairman, Aviation Ground Handling Association of Nigeria (AGHAN), has been conferred with the 2023 Aviation Personality of the Year award. The award was bestowed on Adigun at the 10th edition of the Nigeria Transport Lecture, organised by Nigeria Transport Award, publishers of the Transport Day, held on Thursday at Raddison Blu Hotel, Government Reserved Area (G.R.A), Ikeja, Lagos. The glamorous ceremony convened by Mr. Frank Kintum, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Transport Day, is an annual event where eminent personalities who have distinguished themselves in professional excellence and service to humanity in the private and public sectors are honoured. According to Kintum, Adigun was conferred with the special award in recognition of his huge contribution to the development of the aviation industry, especially the ground handling sub-sector where he has made a huge milestone in over three decades. Kintum explained that Adigun was selected for the award by the board and management of Transport Day after emerging tops in the polls conducted by the team. He specifically said that since Adigun was appointed the Chairman of AGHAN, he had been able to reposition the ground handling companies in the sector and worked endlessly to ensure a review of the former handling rates, which had been in existence in the last three decades. He said: âMr. Olaniyi Adigun, the President of AGHAN was nominated for this honour after a rigorous exercise, which focused on his activities and achievements in the Nigerian aviation industry, spanning over three decades. Adigun through his works, has consistently promoted safety, which is the hallmark of the global aviation industry. âWe want to use this medium to call on Adigun to continue to do more for the growth and development of the Nigerian aviation industry. To whom much is given, much more is expected from him.â In his speech, Adigun thanked the organisers of the event for finding him worthy to be selected for the honour. He also expressed delight at the achievements of AGHAN, but maintained that the association and the successes recorded were not about him, but its entire members. He added that the award had thrown AGHAN up for more good work. He said: âI feel very elated, appreciated and privileged to be awarded as the Aviation Personality of the Year 2023 after a long effort that we put into the sector, especially in the ground handling sector of the industry. âIt is unfortunate that the ground handling sub-sector of the aviation industry has not been given fair deal and attention by the government and its agencies, but some organisations in the sector have realised the enormous work that we do and awarded me the honour. âLike I do say, the government and its agencies are always losing money because of unfair competition in the handling sub-sector of the industry, especially between the two major ground handling companies. AGHAN as a body, has been trying to bring the major competitors together for the enhanced Nigerian economy and we pray this will work out very soon and for the betterment of the industry and the country at large.â He regretted that the airlines were taking full advantage of the unhealthy competition between the two major ground handling companies, but said since AGHAN came onboard a few years ago, such unwholesome practice had reduced to the barest minimum. Adigun came into the aviation industry in 1993 as a staff of the defunct national carrier, Nigeria Airways. At the Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO), he rose through the ranks to become its Executive Director, Sales & Marketing from 2018- 2024. During his stay, the department was able to implement various sales and marketing strategies that increased the companyâs revenue significantly, while its number of clienteles increased tremendously. Adigun was also appointed the pioneer Chairman of AGHAN in 2021.",

        "content": "It has been almost two years since Joaquin Domagoso became a father to his son, Scott. In his interview on Tuesday's \"Fast Talk with Boy Abunda,\" the Sparkle star shared that the little boy has started schooling. \"I'm happy where my son is. He started school officially, so congrats to little Scott. Every day, new memories are being made,\" Joaquin said. The young actor said that he stands by the decisions he made. \"My career won't stop itself because of my decisions because my will is as strong as my love for my son,\" he said. When asked what he discovered about himself as he goes through fatherhood, Joaquin said, \"That I can work harder than I think I can't. There are things na before, I feel like, 'Hindi, kaya ko 'yon, pabayaan na, 'wag na.'\" Now that he is already a dad, Joaquin said that he has also become a role model. \"Kumbaga if I don't do these things, my son won'tâ'di niya ako susundan,\" he said. \"And there are other things na, kumbaga, work. Working a 9-5 job, realizing it how other people would go through it. 'Yung tipong you wake up for your son, you do all these things. Tapos 'yung at the end of the day, uuwi ka, hinihintay ka pa rin. All the joys. 'Yung purpose ko sa buhay, nabuo.\" Joaquin did not share much about his current relationship status. \"Sa aking love life ngayon po, I don't want to say anything too much, but right now, I'm in a very happy place,\" he said. Joaquin's dad, Isko Moreno , first revealed in July 2022 that Joaquin had welcomed a baby boy with Raffa Castro . In a previous interview on the show, Joaquin admitted that he felt scared of becoming a father , but his father was supportive about it. \"He was dancing. Sumasayaw si Papa,\" he said. \"Nawala 'yung stress ko 'cause I was so scared to tell them like what is my dad gonna say? Baka magalit. Magagalit sila.\" Joaquin currently appears in GMA Afternoon Prime series \" Lilet Matias: Attorney-at-Law ,\" which airs weekdays at 3:20 p.m. after \"Abot-Kamay Na Pangarap.\"",

Join the debate on our social media channels Manager Martin Paterson has left Burton Albion after the club narrowly avoided relegation from League One, BBC Radio Derby reports. The role at Pirelli Stadium was the 37-year-old former Swansea City, Barnsley and Inter Miami assistant manager's first job in charge of a senior side. Thoughts? âItâs been in the works for a while. Iâm really looking forward to getting started. âI had positive chats with the manager and itâs a club with real potential with the project and the plans that he has got in place. âThe run the club went on towards the end of last season made everyone pay attention. Itâs a good club with a good manager and Iâm hoping we can do good things.â League Two champs Stockport County have a new man. Jay Mingi has joined from Colchester. Notts County have signed Bradford City defender Matty Platt on a two-year contract - the League Two club's first summer signing. Platt, 26, moves to Meadow Lane on a free transfer following two years with the Bantams. He moved to Valley Parade after three years at Barrow, who he helped win promotion back to the Football League Two in 2020. \"Jay had a fantastic back end of the League Two season at Colchester,\" \"He showed his versatility and intelligence, switching from a familiar central midfield role to wide centre-back, right-back and right wing-back at times. âWe believe he has real potential to develop, whilst immediately having the physical characteristics of being on the front foot, aggressive and quick, which will allow him to flourish in League One.\" \"It became apparent during the review that the club and Pete had different perspectives on the way forward,\" \"So it was mutually agreed that this was the best and most appropriate way to proceed. \"We wish Pete well in his future endeavours.\" What do you make of Pete Wildâs sacking?

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In the world of finance where new changes are occurring at a very fast pace, investments through conventional finance and the incorporation of technology like artificial intelligence are not just a trend but a revolution. This fusion is empowering the investment ecosystem for transparency, open access, and future-readiness bringing financial opportunities closer to everyone. At the center of this process, there are two key areas â artificial intelligence and blockchain, which are actively getting involved in the recreation of peopleâs vision of investments. Big data, through the use of artificial intelligence and other predictive analytical tools, is enhancing the opportunities for making sound investment decisions while blockchain is the godsend for truly secure financial transactions. In parallel, the mentioned technologies are providing the foundation for new trends like tokenized assets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and relatively a new approach â DeFi or Regenerative Finance, based on the investment in social and environmental initiatives. Thus, Tokenized assets with the help of blockchain technology, it is a step forward. In essence, through the tokenization of physical assets using blockchain, investors can own a fraction of the asset because the technology subdivides the ownership rights to the underlying asset into smaller portions. This democratization of assets applies to various fields of the economy and have started with real estate assets, artworks, and even unique rarities. Furthermore, AI occupies a crucial place in this environment because it offers the instruments for the precise analysis of the great amount of information and anticipating market behaviors. For instance, using AI algorithms is possible to detect attractive investmentsâ options in real-time and thus maximize investment outcomes. We observe this symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain in such areas such as digital coins and tokens that have become fashionable. These digital assets usually have initial and/or subsequent rewards where more or new coin holders are bestowed with free tokens making the cryptocurrency investment more attractive and easily accessible. This though creates the potential of making huge profits through these unique financial entities. _algoic trading strategies are capable of making trades in a very short time and exploiting gaps in the overall market that may not be apparent to a human trader. While the above mentioned transactions have a lot of possibility of being fraudulent or manipulated, with the use of blockchain, it maximizes the security and transparency as well. This high-performance, high-speed, highly effective system is a significant improvement and will be of tremendous help to experienced investors and newcomers alike. Moreover, establishing ReFi as the trend of investment with an aim is proving to be rather popular. As integrated AI and blockchain solutions, ReFi projects work to create positive social and environmental impacts alongside solutions for money. Such projects may involve climate change solutions like energy generation from natural sources, efficient farming, and social justice products, which give individuals an opportunity to invest in the future and generate profits. Another work in progress key feature of the evolution of the investment landscape is decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. These platforms utilize blockchain technology to dispose of the middlemen and cut the costs but at the same time improved efficacy. DeFi puts people in the position of providing and requesting funds, goods, or services, with others and often presents artificial intelligence solutions to perform the necessary operations. Due to this transparency, all transactions made and captured in the block chain are traceable by the public thereby minimizing on cases of disputations and increasing trust among the players involved. Furthermore, the usage of airdrop has evolved as a vital strategy for attracting the community and involving the users in the DeFi ecosystem. It explains how through providing a variety of tokens users with free tokens DeFi projects can gain popularity very quickly and encourage people to engage in activities within their platforms. Integrating AI into Defi platforms enhances some of the functionality of DeFi platforms in the following ways. AI can be applied to identify usersâ behavior and patterns, market trends and fluctuations, and provide recommendations on which investments should be made, how they should be distributed, and which direction the market is likely to take nex so you can make moneyt. Such level of customization and idea of future in financial aspect was beyond the boldest scenario in traditional finance. Furthermore, it is capable of analyzing unstructured data hence can include social feeds, oil price changes, Acts of God, tweets erratically, and any other issues that relate to investment. They integrate this approach to make sure that AI driven investments not only yield higher returns but are also immune to instabilities in the market conditions. To conclude, the integration of the traditional financial industry with top-notch technological solutions such as the use of AI and blockchain technologies is making the investment environment more comprehensive and effective. The decentralization of possibilities and the mitigation of risks, through using Artificial Intelligence in trading, and by means of tokenization, the advent of DeFi, ReFi â these trends are contributing towards a more open and explicable approach to investments. As to the possibilities of earning money through these new financial tools, the prospect can be very high, and it opens a new vista to all those involved in the financial market whether a new player or an experienced investor. It can, therefore, be concluded that as we advance in the future, the promotion and application of such advanced technologies are bound to come up with more groundbreaking specialty investment and consequently yield a positive future for a worthy better future for generations.

With over 80 companies establishing their operations in the nation, itâs becoming a hub for diverse business activities. This surge in corporate presence is a testament to the countryâs strategic efforts to diversify its economy and create a more conducive environment for business growth. Historically, El Salvadorâs economy was heavily reliant on agriculture, with coffee exports being the primary source of revenue. However, the turn of the century marked a pivotal shift as the country adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency, paving the way for increased trade and financial links. This move, coupled with the expansion of the manufacturing sector, has reduced the nationâs dependence on coffee and positioned it as an attractive destination for international businesses. The list of companies operating in El Salvador is diverse, ranging from financial institutions like the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador to telecommunications giants such as Claro El Salvador and Tigo El Salvador. The country also boasts a vibrant media landscape with entities like El Faro and La Prensa GraÌfica, reflecting a robust mass media sector.

        "content": "PORT MORESBY â Papua New Guinea authorities say nearly 7,900 people living near the site of a deadly landslide are \"at risk\" as rock and debris continue to move down the hillside. An alert for potential evacuation has been put out, with a province official saying the mountain remains \"very active\". Rescuers say it is increasingly unlikely that victims will be found alive in the rubble. The country's disaster agency says it fears about 2,000 people were buried when a mountainside collapsed last Friday. This is much higher than the UN's estimate of about 670 victims. The UN says it has been difficult to establish an exact death toll as access to the site and those buried under the mass remain difficult. Part of that is due to complications around the search and recovery mission, which has now largely turned into a retrieval operation of bodies, various UN officials have said. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Niels Kraaier from Unicef Papua New Guinea told news agency AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" Only six bodies had been recovered as of Tuesday, according to local officials. Villagers have been using using shovels, sticks and their bare hands to try and remove huge rocks and rubble amid hold-ups in the arrival of heavy machinery, and also cultural sensitivities around the use of such machines like excavators near bodies. Standing in a crowd of mourners on Monday, local resident Jiman Yandam said people would keep digging manually to try and recover victims. \"We don't know where the bodies are buried, but we will not give up, we will keep going,\" the former community leader told Reuters news agency. One woman, standing in the wreckage, described feeling helpless. \"I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on, and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\" Evit Kambu said. \"But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\" The terrain remains dangerous as rocks continue to fall. Videos taken during the day have shown rocks tumbling down the mountain. âItâs still very active. The mountain is breaking up, \" Sandis Tsaka, Enga Provincial Administrator told the BBC. \"Thereâs continuous movement of rock and debris which is making our search and rescue and recovery operations a challenge,\" he added. The rubble remains 10m deep in some places and the mass of debris is still moving down the hillside, prompting authorities to alert nearby communities to the risk and issuing evacuation notices. \"Because of the landslide, the impact area of the landslide is gradually increasing. So the homes and properties that were not affected by the original landslide area are growing every day,\" Mr Tsaka said. Another village close to the first-hit Yambali village was now also in danger, he said. There is also growing alarm over the risk of infection and disease in the area as the mass of bodies trapped under the rubble begin to decay. The UN had warned that currents were flowing down the hillside under the rubble. \"The water that is stuck between the ground and the debris is flowing - and the bodies are starting to decay. Can you image [the impact] on more than 2,000 bodies buried under this land- unable to be removed,\" UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told the BBC on Tuesday. Amid the treacherous conditions, aid groups say they are focusing on the immediate task of getting basic supplies like food, water and hygiene kits to residents. But there have been several barriers- including the highway to the village being blocked and damaged by the landslide. âOn Tuesday, it was reported that a bridge south of the landslide area, connecting province centers Hagen and Wabeg, had also collapsed making it more difficult for humanitarian groups delivering relief. Australia has pledged an airlift of supplies which is expected to arrive on Wednesday. Local officials say about 3,800 people had been living in the hillside village prior to the landslide, which took place around 03:00 on Friday morning and flattened more than 150 homes. The mountain's collapse has been attributed to weeks of heavy rain and other wet conditions in the area. Prime Minister James Marape had earlier in the week sent his condolences and directed national response teams to the region. The disaster comes as Mr Marape faces political pressure - parliament was expected to vote on a no-confidence motion against him on Tuesday. â BBC < Previous Page Next Page >",

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 â The Council of Governors have lauded Members of Parliament for reaching a consensus to allocate Sh400 billion to devolved units following protracted battles between the two houses on the shareable revenue allocation. The County Bosses expressed their gratitude to Senators for remaining adamant to push the shareable revenue to counties upwards by Sh9 billion in the incoming financial year 2024/2025 which commences in June. âDevolution is sacrosanct in the constitution and adequately resourcing functions that counties are mandated to deliver is progressive and a welcome move,â COG chairperson Waiguru stated. The mediation team of the two houses reached a consensus following differing proposal as the Senate initially pushing to have Counties allocated Sh415 billion while the National Assembly wanted the counties allocated Sh391 billion. The stalemate on the matter was ironed out after the Senate and National Assembly reached an agreement over the allocation for shareable revenue in the financial year 2024/2025 following days taken in lengthy deliberations. National Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Ndindi Nyoro who co-chaired the talks exuded confidence that progress had been made. âThe Senate has agreed to reduce their figure by Sh15 billion while the National Assembly has agreed to push up its earlier figure by Sh9 billion in the spirit of give and take so that we can resolve this matter and allow Counties to get their increased allocation from Sh385 billion in the last financial year,â Nyoro stated. Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi who co-chaired committee called upon county bosses to ensure championing of development in their respective counties through prudent use of resources. âWe have held lengthy deliberations and we are all in agreement that devolution Iâd working and that it should be supported by ensuring that counties get sufficient funds to carry out the devolved functions,â Murungi said. Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula appointed nine members each to join the mediation team so as to iron out the stalemate that would have affected the counties. Murungi and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were elected as the co- chairmen for the mediation committee. Wetangula appointed Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Teso South MP Mary Emase, Ugenya MP David Ochieng, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto,Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi,Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, and Garsen MP Ali Wario to be members of this team. Kingi appointed Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Machakos Senator Kavindu Muthama, Marsabit Senator Mohammed Chute and Migori Senator Eddy Oketch to be members of the committee.

        "content": "ONE of the stars from EastEnders has slammed his house builder after being left in an 'unsuitable home'. The soap actor posted a comedy video onto social media as he pranced about in his unfinished new home. Liam Hatch, 27, is one of the newest cast members of the long-running BBC soap. He recently joined the square as bad-boy Logan in a recent storyline where he bullied Amy Mitchell (Ellie Dadd). His group also beat up both Denzel Danes ( Jaden Ladega ) and Yolande Trueman ( Angela Wynter ) in horrific scenes. However, it seems the EastEnders actor and personal trainer had a huge drama of his own at his new home. He took to social media in an attempt to raise attention, after he failed to get adequate answers by the building company. Liam recently moved into a new-build home, but he claims he was left with no flooring and wonky windows. He also claimed that he cannot house his household appliances and that loose screws dug into his feet. The star posted a sarcastic dancing video to the track 'Faith' by George Michael from his abode. The unfinished flooring and lack of furniture was clearly seen as he jokingly praced around the kitchen and garden of the property. In the captions he wrote a long essay which read: \"Bought a new house... ð¡ *CUT THE CELEBRATION* ð â. \"We have floors unsuitable to lay on, we have screws digging into my feet, we have wonky windows and a cupboard not straight to fit my washing machine in, and to top it all off they ainât answering the emails....but...we have faith.\" \"I have seen many negative comments with no reply... Iâm here to make sure peopleâs voices are heard. @taylorwimpey ð\" After tagging the company, he finished the post with a string of sarcastic hashtags as he lamented the seemingly unfinished job. The Sun has approached Taylor Wimpey for comment. This comes after fans were recently shocked after they discovered Liam's real age and his racy Instagram account . Despite appearing as a teenager in a school uniform in the soap, making him no older than 16, Liam is in fact 27 in real life. When he isn't working as an actor, he has a side hustle as a personal trainer and online coach. Aside from this new video, the rest of his Instagram account is full of shirtless pictures of him working out at the gym. He's also partial to showing off his rear end as A number of pictures on his profile page show him posing outside, facing away from the camera totally naked.",

        "content": "Brooks will stay at Weymouth for a 10th campaign in claret and blue, meaning he could reach the 350-game landmark next term. The Weymouth vice-captain currently has 337 appearances, with 31 goals and 30 assists for the Terras. Brooks made just 25 appearances last season before a serious knee injury put paid to any involvement for the remainder of the campaign. He has undergone surgery after electing to continue playing and confirmed to Echosport last November that he would prefer to finish his career with Weymouth . In a club statement, Weymouth said: âWe are delighted to confirm the signature of Calvin Brooks to continue in claret and blue for the 24/25 season. âA man who needs little introduction to the Terrasâ faithful, Calvin has become a great part of the club and surrounding community. Originally made his debut back on 27th September 2014. âMarking this upcoming season as his 10th for the club. Impressively, only eight players have featured in more campaigns at the club since World War Two. âCalvin unfortunately missed a large part of the end of last season through injury and has since undergone surgery to aid his recovery. His return is anticipated closer than those may think. âWith 337 appearances currently under his belt, 31 goals and 30 assists, it gives a continuation of consistency to this ever-growing new-look Weymouth as we approach the new season.â Brooks is the 10th Weymouth player to commit for the 2024/25 season, with Ezio Touray, Brandon Goodship, Jordon Thompson, Leo Hamblin, Charlie Rowan, Gerard Benfield, captain Tom Bearwish, Keelan OâConnell and Josh McQuoid all pledging allegiance to the Terras.",

        "content": "BRITISH households are saving hundreds of pounds each year by introducing efficient upgrades to their home. A poll of 2,000 adults responsible for paying the bills found 63% have invested in home energy efficiencies, with a quarter doing so in the last year. The average household estimates this has made an annual saving of Â£283.90. Motivations behind these upgrades have been reducing energy bills (49%), making their home more sustainable (36%), and adding value to their property (23%). The most popular home improvements that have been made include draught proofing, boiler upgrades, and insulation. And 3.3 million smart meters were installed in British homes in 2023. The study, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, found that in addition to making savings on their energy, the average bill payer believes they have increased their average house value by Â£2,934.60 by making certain improvements. Smart Energy GB has teamed up with property website, Rightmove, to reveal this data. It shows that improving a homeâs Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from F to C could increase its value by up to 15% - which for the average home means an extra Â£55,848. Tim Bannister, Rightmoveâs property expert, said: âWe know upfront costs are the biggest barrier to people making green improvements in their home, especially when it can take time to see the return on investment and lower bills. âOur analysis shows that thereâs a green price premium on top of the local house price growth when people sell homes that theyâve been able to make green improvements to, and in the coming years a homeâs energy efficiency rating is likely to become an even bigger factor when choosing a home to buy or rent .â The study found exactly three quarters would consider the EPC rating of a property when looking to buy, compared to only 38% who wouldâve said the same a decade ago. It also emerged the average adult in charge of household bills would be willing to pay an additional Â£6,360 for a home equipped with sustainable features, according to the OnePoll.com data. While 26% think making home upgrades to improve energy efficiency are now more important than aesthetic ones. Victoria Bacon, director at Smart Energy GB, said: âSmart home investments can be very good for the bank balance in the long run, but not all upgrades have to be costly. âSmart meters are installed at no extra cost by your energy supplier and are a tool that more and more Brits are using to help them find ways to reduce their energy use day to day, which can have a noticeable positive impact on energy bills over time. âThey also open up access to reward schemes which offer money off energy bills for reducing energy use at certain times.â The research also revealed 36% have made eco upgrades to make their property more sustainable, and create energy efficient homes for younger generations (31%). ENERGY bills remain relatively high leaving many worrying over the thermostat. Energy experts have revealed the exact temperature to set it at so that you can save cash and still keep warm. When it comes to your thermostat, the Energy Saving Trust recommends you should set it to the \"lowest comfortable temperature\". For the majority of us, this is between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius. It's just the right balance between keeping your home warm, and keeping those energy bills as low as possible. If you have your thermostat set at a higher temperature you can probably afford to turn it down and still keep cosy. Of course, there are exceptions like anyone who is in ill health , and there is support available to cover extra costs . Just by turning down the temp by a single degree, you could save as much as Â£100 a year. If you cut it by more you will obviously make even bigger savings. The Energy Saving Trust also says that you donât need to turn your thermostat up when it is colder outside, the house will still heat up to the set temperature. While 62% claim they think more about how their energy usage around the home will impact the environment than they did 10 years ago. It also emerged 23% of those polled plan to make certain green changes to where they live this year. Steph McGovern, broadcaster and consumer finance expert, said: âI know first-hand how difficult it can be to decide the best way to future-proof a home and make smart investments. âBut with so many options out there, itâs reassuring to know that you donât have to spend a huge amount of money to add value to a property and save on energy bills.â Smart Energy GB has partnered with MoneyMagpie to share tips for people looking to make energy efficient upgrades to their home: Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry. The singer and Dunkirk actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.' The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship. Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.' Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet. Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn. Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival. Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022 . The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year. When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and sheâs an incredible mother.' Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo . The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina. 'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina. In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

Travis's recent fashion statement is under scrutiny after being photographed in a heavily-ripped jeans on Sunday. The NFL player was spotted outside next to Patrick Mahomes and Marquise Brown during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. However, his unique pants stole the limelight as netizens were intrigued by his pants with rips all over when the photos emerged on social media. One witty X (formerly known as Twitter) user proposed that perhaps Taylor Swift's cats were responsible for the look. âWhat the f*** did taylor cats do with his jeans?â @thisisvertrying quipped alongside a photo of the torn jeans. The joke caught Jason's attention who also endorsed it by reposting it with the caption, âNow thatâs funny!â Travis paired the tattered jeans with sunglasses and a white shirt with an apple print. Travis was all smiles as he made the Rock On sign with his hands.",

He said the ordinance was utilised for shameful political purposes and many innocent people fell victim to it. The NAB Ordinance has been amended, under which the period of remanding accused in the NAB cases has been extended from 14 days to 40 days. Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani Monday signed two new ordinances, NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. He signed the ordinances on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The promulgation came after federal cabinetâs approval of the amendments to the ordinances. Under the amended NAB law, the sentence duration for an officer, convicted for framing cases based on ill will, has been reduced to two years from five years. After the promulgation of the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have retired judges as its members, besides the serving jurists.",

        "content": "The Philippine Heart Association (PHA) on Tuesday called on lawmakers to expedite legislation that would allocate automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places, such as government facilities and schools. In a forum, PHA President Dr. Ronald Cuyco emphasized that AEDs should be in tandem with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order save lives of those suffering from cardiac arrest. An AED is a portable device that helps those experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. It is used to counteract fibrillation of the heart muscle and restore normal heartbeat by delivering a brief electric shock to the heart. âWe are praying that this gadget should be available and will be available in public places. Thatâs what weâre pushing in the Congress. Hopefully, a lot of people will help us, even convince the executive branch to support this,â Cuyco said. In the Philippines, there is already a CPR Law (Republic Act 10871), seeking to make lifesavers out of the youth by making CPR training part of the basic education curriculum. However, bills on mandating AEDs in public areas remain stuck in Congress. At the House of Representatives, several measures have been filed, including House Bill No. 1393 and 7783 that would require the provision of AEDs in places open to the public like schools, workplaces, government offices, and similar establishments. A counterpart measure was also filed in the Senate in 2022 during the 18th Congress, but remained pending at the committee level. Pending the law, Malasakit at Bayanihan Rep. Anthony Golez Jr. recommended the PHA to encourage President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to sign an executive order to institutionalize the placement of AEDs in these public places to help save more lives. He said that the PHA could further suggest adding AEDs in public hospitals and barangay health centers, depending on the budget that could be allocated for such. âWhen you have that, then it means to say that itâs a priority of this government and the chances of having a Republic Act will be higher,â Golez said. The PHA welcomed the recommendation of the congressman, vowing to be proactive in pursuing other alternatives to push their advocacy. Cuyco said that he is also constantly lobbying to start the deliberations on the said measure in the Senate to the office of Senator Bong Go, who chairs the Committee on Health and Demography. Ischaemic heart disease or cardiovascular disease remains to be the number one killer of Filipinos, with a total of 100,848 cases recorded from January to November 2023. This accounted for 19% percent of the total deaths in the Philippines, based on data by the Philippine Statistics Authority. âRF, GMA Integrated News",
