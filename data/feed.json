        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders dismantled the batting powerhouse of Sunrisers Hyderabad for only 113 runs to set up an eight-wicket victory Sunday and a third Indian Premier League title. The $2.9 million signing Mitchell Starc rattled Hyderabad's top-order with 2-14, and all six Kolkata bowlers took wickets before the most aggressive batting team this season was bowled out for the lowest ever total in the history of IPL finals. Venkatesh Iyer then led Kolkata to 114-2 in 10.3 overs with a blazing 26-ball unbeaten 52. Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring 39 in 32. \"It was comprehensive,\" said Kolkata captain Shreyas Iyer, who also played in an IPL final for Delhi Capitals in 2020 when his team lost to Mumbai Indians. \"This is what we demanded from the players and they stood up. It's difficult to express the feelings, so much to cherish right now. There was no one individual who took us here, it was a cumulative effort, it was a flawless season for us.\" Kolkata previously won the IPL titles in 2012 and '14 and had dominated this season by finishing on top at the end of league stage with nine wins from 14 games. It even dominated the most aggressive Hyderabad batting lineup by winning both in the league stage and also in the qualifier, where Australian paceman Starc stood out before routing Pat Cummins' team in a one-sided final. Starc and Cummins will combine in Australia's squad at the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts Saturday with the United States taking on Canada in Dallas. The IPL gave some of the world's leading players time to prepare for the World Cup in the U.S. and Caribbean. The six-week tournament culminated with the final, and Cummins had first choice had winning the toss and deciding to bat. But the Sunrisers were deflated inside the first seven overs as they limped to 47-4 against an impeccable attack of Starc, Harshit Rana (2-24) and Vaibhav Arora (1-24). Starc started the rout when he clean bowled Abhishek Sharma with a ball that swung away from the left-hander and knocked back the off stump. Travis Head, who regularly scored quick runs for Hyderabad this season, edged Arora's first ball and went for a golden duck. At 6-2 in two overs, Hyderabad struggled to recover from that double loss. Starc's three-over spell in the power play gave Kolkata another wicket when Rahul Tripathi top-edged the left-arm quick. There was no power-hitting from the South African pair of Aiden Markram, who made a struggling 20 off 23 balls, and Heinrich Klaasen (16 in 17) as Kolkata kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Markram's weak pull shot against Andre Russell landed in the lap of Starc at long-on and Klaasen departed in the 15th over when he dragged Rana's off-cutter back onto his stumps. Russell mopped up the lower order with 3-19 and Hyderabad was in danger of not reaching 100 before Cummins hit 24 off 19 balls and was the last man dismissed in the penultimate over. \"Russell has got a magic wand and he is looking towards me to bowl,\" Shreyas Iyer said. \"In the majority of the games he gave us breakthroughs.\" Kolkata lost Sunil Narine before Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed three sixes and four boundaries, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz effectively sealed the game with some aggressive hitting in a 91-run stand. It was heartbreak for Hyderabad, which had toppled IPL batting records throughout the season and three times posted totals exceeding 265. However, it got bowled out for its lowest total of the season at a venue where Kolkata, owned by Bollywood celebrity Shah Rukh Khan, had happy memories of winning its first IPL title in 2012. \"We were outplayed,\" Cummins said. \"They didn't give us anything ... they bowled fantastically.\"",

        "content": "The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms' intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country's second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice.",

        "content": "German Ambassador to Nigeria, Annett Gunther, has claimed that renewable energy can create over 112 million jobs by 2030. She said this in Abuja at a reception organised by the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology for a German delegation on green hydrogen, recently. She highlighted that the sector had already generated employment opportunities for at least 390,000 individuals in Germany. Gunther declared, “The hydrogen industry is growing, stimulating economic growth and creating jobs in the process. “Hydrogen does not only seek to meet the climate change goals but also seeks to feed the population in this part of the world. “We are on the same page in this partnership on hydrogen and it will be in the interest of both countries.” The German Government was in partnership with Nigeria to combat climate change and related issues in the country, the German ambassador said. She added that the perennial floods in parts of Nigeria are a global challenge, aggravated by the climate change phenomenon. She noted that all hands must be on deck to tackle the root causes of climate issues, adding that decarbonisation and zero emissions would help to solve the problem not only in Nigeria but globally. The ambassador added that Nigeria had an ambitious goal in its energy transition plan, developed under the previous administration to ensure zero emissions until 2060, adding that, if properly implemented, it could be impactful. She revealed, “In our cooperation talks, we are interested in how to help Nigeria achieve that goal. “We, therefore, have opened a hydrogen diplomacy office called the German-Nigerian hydrogen diplomacy office where experts organise meetings, conferences, and discussions and bring together stakeholders in the area of renewable energies and particularly on hydrogen. “Even though gas is currently the primary source of energy and power, we have to chart the way forward. We need to have these discussions to reach our climate goals earlier or as soon as possible.”",

        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Women affairs minister Uju Ohanenye’s decision to file a suit that put paid to the impending mass marriage of 100 orphaned girls in Niger State is well-intentioned, but she might soon discover that she played God for nothing. While addressing a press conference, the minister pointed out that she stopped the ceremony so the ministry could find out if the girls to be married out were of the appropriate ages, determine the (self-)interests of the organisers/ sponsors, and crucially, if those women gave their consent. Now, the last point is where her good intentions might meet some blowback. Yes, it is good to inquire if those marriages are consensual. But what is consent and what does it mean to give it amidst the circumstances of choicelessness, social/religious pressures, manipulation, and fear of the uncertain (especially for poor rural women with limited education and marketable skills)? When women whose possibilities are narrowed by material poverty and limited upward mobility choose marriage as a face-saving option, a means to claim some social respectability, what does it mean to have made a “choice”? Sometimes, people consent to a legal contract like a marriage because they have no other choices. For all her good intentions, Ohanenye might soon find out that the road paved with the good intentions of gender empowerment might still lead to the Nigerian social and religious hell. Why? Given how much the controversy is wrapped in religious sentiment, it cannot be that hard for the girls’ family circles and the religious patriarchs in their community to “persuade” (read: coerce) the young women into giving “consent.” Merely for the audacity of a southern Christian woman to challenge what they would like us to believe is an expression of the Islamic North culture, “consent” can be extracted from the girls to vindicate the decision of their religious leaders who have socialised them into believing that marriage is their destiny. So, if those women insist to the minister’s emissaries that they gave their “consent” as legal adults, would that still justify the decision to mass marry them off? What would the minister then do if those women insist the marriage is their choice? That is why I think she needs to be careful about uncritically elevating “consent” into the main issue at stake here. Many a “consents” inked into legal documents were never truly consensual; they were merely inconvenient choices made within the constrictions of choicelessness. What I think needs to be severely discouraged is the culture of public officials using public funds to mass-marry people. Northern governors do it frequently, but it is a misuse of public resources. Other than a mad obsession with seeing women’s heads buried between the laps of domesticity, the men—and it’s always men!—have never advanced any logical reason for mass marriages and why the government should sponsor them. They say marriage is better than waywardness, but why are those the only options available to a woman? Being married goes beyond the wedding ceremony. Marriage is a serious business that should be reserved only for those who can afford it—physically, emotionally, socially, and quite crucially, financially. Those who do not have the money to stage a ceremony can do themselves the favour of getting married quietly in front of a judge, go home, and start building their lives. Nobody needs to get married on charity, period. Marriage is also a private business, and nothing—and I repeat, nothing—says having a grand wedding makes you more married than those who have the dignity to wed according to the limit of their means. The issue of using public funds for marriage is another reason I see those criticising the minister for her intervention as clowns. You cannot purport to get married with other people’s money and then turn around to tell them they have no business in your private (religious) affair. Speaker of Niger State House of Assembly, Abdulmalik Sarkindaji, the culprit who announced his plans to sponsor the ceremony as his “constituency project,” is also playing God by making the girls’ wedding his business. Yes, those girls lost their parents in banditry attacks in Mariga Local Government Area (which he represents), but why is it his business to pay the girls’ dowry? He is a lawmaker, and a public representative should not assume a paternalistic role in other people’s private lives. It would be a different argument if he were a private individual using his money to sponsor weddings. Rich and generous people sponsor weddings; it is their prerogative. Sarkindaji’s legislative overreach is the fallout of a political culture that hands lawmakers a huge sum of money to carry out something called “community projects,” initiatives well outside their responsibilities as lawmakers. For long, lawmakers have loosely defined what constitutes constituency projects, which is why people like Sarkindaji can stretch the meaning beyond tolerable elastic limits. The mass wedding event, which would have taken place tomorrow but is now suspended, was to be conducted alongside the flagging-off of a road network and—this is where it gets interesting— distribution of cars to the eight district heads and other critical stakeholders in the local government area. That the wedding of 100 couples is not even the main point of the event—just one item to check off the agenda—makes you wonder why the spectacle was necessary in the first place. That old men will be gifted cars while young women will get husbands illustrates how the skewed allocation of resources makes for poor productivity in this country. If Sarkindaji wants to be a proper sugar daddy, he should consider giving the car gifts to the women instead. Who knows, that initiative might be their chance at an independent life which, I can bet, Sarkindaji’s daughters enjoy. Though imperfect, Ohanenye’s challenging Sarkindaji is commendable. In fact, it is about time someone stood up to people who mass-marry poor women for dubious reasons and instructed them there is more to life than continuously satiating the region beneath your waistline. Mass marriage, as it takes place in northern Nigeria, is an agenda to keep poor people poor and perpetually beholden to predatory religious and political leaders. The problem of northern Nigeria has been a problem of the libido. To contain the libidinal urges, they stage mass (and early) marriages that produce mass children whose impoverished existence culminates in mass poverty, mass urchins that prowl the streets and eventually grow up into mass terrorists and mass bandits. If Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world today, most of it has to do with the North. They reproduce an ever-growing army of children merely born to give them political victories and decommissioned soon after every election. Nobody has plans for those children’s future. And for a long time, nobody could challenge them because of their propensity for violence. Their leaders’ inability to think of serious means of resolving their social issues outside of frequently tucking people inside marriage to reproduce has created a mass problem for Nigeria, one that will unfold for at least another 50 years. Finally, media reports stated that in response to the audacity of Ohanenye to file a suit against an impending mass marriage, the Muslim Lawyers Association declared that they had raised 32 lawyers—five of them Senior Advocates of Nigeria—to challenge her in court. As much as I doubt whether the minister is on firm legal ground on this issue, I think 32 supposedly trained professionals coming up to challenge her judgment is another pathetic example of the Nigerian tendency to overdo things. I would not worry about them too much though. If that many lawyers had to bunch themselves up like firewood just to pursue one case, they must be incompetent, ineffective, and frankly, unserious.",

        "description": "A successful takeover of Anglo American Plc under the arrangements BHP Group has offered could lead to outflows of $4.3 billion from South Africa, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis. The post JPMorgan Says BHP Plan Risks $4.3 Billion S. Africa Outflow appeared first on Daily Maverick.",
        "content": "Such an outflow, if a deal goes ahead, could weaken the rand, which has gained 4.4% against the dollar, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, over the last five weeks.The deal, proposed by BHP and rejected by Anglo, would involve Anglo distributing its holdings in its South African iron ore and platinum units to shareholders. That, according to JPMorgan’s South African mining analyst Catherine Cunningham, would lead to developed-market investor index funds selling the unbundled stocks, resulting in the outflow. While Anglo has spurned BHP’s $49 billion bid, it has agreed to talk to the company, which must now make a firm offer by May 29. A successful deal could also affect the share prices of the units, Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., Cunningham said. “There is now a materially higher probability that BHP will reach an agreed deal,”she wrote in the May 23 note to clients. “We see downside risk to the share prices of both Amplats and Kumba.” Cunningham didn’t assess the potential impact on the rand. Read More on The Takeover Battle: BlackRock Pressed Anglo to Extend Talks With BHP, FT Reports BHP Has a Week to Convince Anglo Its South African Plan Can Work Anglo Opens Talks With BHP After Rejecting $49 Billion Offer According to her analysis, developed-market funds would sell $9.4 billion in stock and $5.1 billion would be bought by emerging-market investors, resulting in the net outflow. JPMorgan estimated the index fund holdings in Anglo American based on publicly available data. “Locals will not sell anything, developed market index funds will sell every share they receive and DM active and others will sell 90% of what they receive,” Cunningham estimated. “EM active funds will buy 50% of what’s for sale.” Amplats, which has a market value of 192 billion rand ($10.5 billion), is nearly 80% owned by Anglo American. Kumba, which has a capitalization of 170 billion rand, is almost 70% held by Anglo American. Developed-market index funds would need to sell their shares as Johannesburg-listed stocks wouldn’t fit their investment mandate. Active investors are likely to want to limit their exposure to single-commodity and -country stocks. Kumba’s mines are all in South Africa while Anglo Platinum has one small operation in Zimbabwe, with the rest in South Africa. Spinning off the companies would also add $14.2 billion to the market capitalization of the MSCI South Africa index, or about 6%, Cunningham wrote. In response to BHP’s approach Anglo rushed out its own plan to streamline its business. That would include spinning off Anglo Platinum while retaining control of Kumba.",

In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

A Monte Carlo, nella zona al porto riservata alle barche di lusso, un motoscafo è improvvisamente piombato, senza controllo, su uno yacht fermo e un piccole gommone su cui, per fortuna, non c'era nessuno. Lo yacht, invece, era pieno di gente per un party, ma non ci sono stati feriti. Secondo alcune informazioni, lo yacht colpito sarebbe di proprietà della famiglia di Logan Sargeant, pilota Williams. L'incidente, infatti, è accaduto durante il Gran Premio di Formula 1. L’impatto è stato violento: i pezzi delle barche travolte sono schizzati in diverse direzioni, mentre il motoscafo è riuscito a restare fermo, incastrandosi fra le due imbarcazioni e mancando per un soffio due persone che stavano passeggiando sul molo.",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday affirmed the victory of Governor Usman Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 11 November 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed it. The tribunal held that the petitioners – the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka – failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous decision, held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Kogi had on 11 November 2023 held its off-cycle election in which Mr Ododo of the APC emerged winner, beating his closest rival, Mr Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Mr Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Mr Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on 13 May when SDP, Mr Ajaka, APC, Mr Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgment in the petition.

Game 7, if necessary, will also be in Glens Falls on Wednesday. Adirondack looked lackluster, suffering back-to-back shutouts, in Games 3 and 4 in Florida last week, but rebounded to bring the series back home with a 4-2, Game 5 victory on Saturday. Ryan Smith scored what proved to be the game-winner at 5:19 of the third period from inside the right circle. The goal, his ninth of the playoffs, came off a well-placed pass from defenseman Darian Skeoch behind the right side of the net. Zach Walker also collected a helper on the play. Meanwhile, goaltender Jeremy Brodeur, making his first start of the series, stopped 35 shots to earn the win and keep Adirondack’s quest for a Kelly Cup championship alive. The Thunder jumped out to an early, 2-0, lead on first-period goals by Filip Engaras and Erik Middendorf. Engaras beat Everblades netminder Cam Johnson with a snapshot from the top of the left circle for a 1-0 advantage. Defenseman Will MacKinnon was credited with the lone assist on Engaras’s fifth goal of the playoffs. Middendorf made it 2-0 with 4:27 left in the first stanza on a wrister from the bottom of the right circle. Skating from behind the net to the bottom of the circle, he turned and fired a shot over Johnson’s left shoulder. Jackson van de Leest and Connor Blake were credited with assists. But the second period was all Florida’s as they outshot the Thunder, 19-6, and knotted the score at two goals apiece. Riese Zmolek beat Brodeur with a wrister from the hash marks at 16:31 of the frame and Cole Moberg scored on a power play with just 1:28 left in the period. Adirondack regained the lead on Smith’s goal, but the outcome was far from determined with almost 15 minutes left to play. With two minutes left on the clock, Thunder forward Ryan Wheeler went to the penalty box on a somewhat controversial call, for delay of game. The puck went above the glass but replays showed that a Florida player lifted Wheeler’s stick. Yet the call stood and the Everblades pulled Johnson in favor of an extra attacker, giving them a 6-on-4 power play. Tristan Ashbrook sealed the outcome by firing a shot into Florida’s empty net after winning a face-off at center ice. The goal was Ashbrook’s eighth of the postseason, shorthanded and unassisted. Ashbrook’s 15 points are the fifth-most among all ECHL playoff performers. Toledo’s Riley Sawchuk tops the leaderboard with 17.",

Despite this, the Taoiseach said he is aware that “people are still hurting” and pledged to keep this in mind during budget negotiations. “Cost of living increases have left [people] feeling that their personal finances are somewhat insecure and, indeed, a real worry that they might not withstand any further shocks,” Mr Harris said. “Therefore, I believe that recognising the existence of cost of living pressures must once again be the focus as we plan for the next budget, building on previous measures over the last number of years.” Out on the streets of Dublin, a lot of people were keen to talk about how difficult it is to get by in the current economic climate. “Today I had to dip into my savings,” one woman in Dublin told Newstalk. “My savings actually consisted of €20, so now I’m down to my last €6 I would say and that was for lunch. “I would say we’re very much still in a cost of living crisis . “A lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck, rent is getting higher, everything is increasing and even though the minimum wage has gone up, you’re just on par with what it was before. “So, I don’t really think I’ve seen any improvement.” One man said he felt the cost of living crisis was far from over. “Being a student, it’s well documented how we get affected by this kind of thing,” he said. “I’m on placement in Dublin at the moment and I’m living with my uncle and I went through three years of college living with my Grandad. “If I didn’t have that availability there, I don’t know if I’d be able to see out the three and a bit years of college.” Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , DCU Economics Professor Edgar Morgenroth said wages have yet to catch up with the galloping inflation of the past two years and so so “on average people are worse off”. “There are some sectors, some groups in the economy that seem to have higher wage increases but most definitely down relative to inflation,” he said. “So, yes people are in real terms worse off than they were.” Professor Morgenroth said the poorest in society always suffer “much much more” when inflation is high and urged the Government to consider this when drawing up budget measures. “If we are going to support people, I would argue that we should support those that are actually most affected and that would be those on lower incomes,” he said.

        "content": "Days after skirmishing with Destiny’s Child alum Kelly Rowland on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival , a security officer was scorned by the internet for her treatment of a K-pop star—marking her third uncomfortable run-in with a celebrity so far. Rowland went viral for pointing her finger at the guard during their encounter last week. She later explained that she felt she had been mistreated and shooed off the red carpet because of her race. “The woman knows what happened. I know what happened,” Rowland said. “I have a boundary, and I stand by those boundaries. And that is it.” “There were other women that attended the carpet who did not quite look like me, and they didn’t get scolded or pushed off or told to get off,” she added. “And I stood my ground, and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground, and that was it.” Soon after, the same security guard, who has not been identified by name, visibly irritated Dominican actress Massiel Taveras, seemingly by trying to move her forward along the carpet. Taveras reacted by pushing the guard away. Then, over the weekend, the guard put up an arm and blocked K-pop star turned actress Yoona, who had turned to greet her fans. The incident was somewhat less dramatic, as Yoona did not react visibly, but still attracted negative attention for the guard’s rough tactics, and because all three celebrities she tussled with are women of color.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Tourism in Japan has witnessed an unprecedented surge, with the country’s rich heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences attracting visitors from across the globe. However, this influx of travellers has brought about unforeseen challenges, as Japan grapples with the delicate task of preserving its cherished cultural traditions while accommodating the growing tourism demand. As iconic destinations bear the brunt of overcrowding and disrespectful behaviour, the nation finds itself at a crossroads, seeking to strike a balance between welcoming guests and safeguarding its way of life. As per a news channel, recently, tourists have been banned from certain private streets in Kyoto’s famous historic Gion district, traditionally home to the teahouses where geisha (geiko) and maiko (apprentice geiko) performers work, largely due to antisocial behaviour. A video titled “Don’t do this in Kyoto” shows a tourist intruding on a geisha’s privacy by filming her persistently.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land.

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After Vizhinjam Port and Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, Adani is preparing to make its presence known in the solar panel market in Kerala. Adani Solar National Sales Head Cecil Augustine stated that there is huge potential in the solar market in Kerala. In 2023 alone, the company had installed 70 MW of solar panels in the state. The company is planning to install 200 MW more rooftop solar panels in Kerala soon. The company also stated that it has set up an extensive warehouse in Coimbatore for the sale of solar panels in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The company hopes to further expand the rooftop solar project in the state under the centre's PM Surya Ghar Mufti Bijli Yojana. The company markets solar panels with a 30-year warranty. The company also claims that if a family spends Rs 1.6 lakh, the household electricity bill can be reduced to close to zero. Adani Solar Company is also preparing to provide solar energy to the international port that is being set up at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram by Adani Ports under the Adani Group.

        "content": "Nigerians have taken to the microblogging site X.com to express their shock, anger, and disbelief over the brutal death of Alex Timileyi, a 200-level engineering student at the Ajayi Crowther University in Oyo State, who was clubbed to death by his colleague on Saturday over a claim that he stole a mobile phone. The student was allegedly beaten to death inside a hostel known as Shepherd Inn on the school premises. After he was allegedly discovered in possession of the stolen cell phone, PRIMANEWS Metro reported that his attackers had allegedly had his (the deceased) hair forcibly shaved. A source in the school who spoke on condition of anonymity with our correspondent because of the sensitivity of the matter claimed that the deceased was beaten from 6 p.m. on Friday to about 10 a.m. on Saturday. “They said they caught him with a stolen phone. They started beating him from 6 p.m. yesterday (Friday) until he died at about 10 a.m. today (Saturday). “The incident happened at ‘Shepherd Inn’. It’s like a lodge or a hostel now. They also shaved the hair of the guy before beating him,” he said. Two different videos that were shared with our correspondent on Saturday night showed the deceased rolling on the hostel floor while other students were beating him with sticks. In one of the videos, one of the students could be heard encouraging the other students to smack the deceased “harder, harder.” The varsity said on Saturday that it had expelled some of the students who had been involved in the incident that resulted in their colleague’s death as a prompt response to the situation while also dismissing the claim that the suspects were members of a cult group. The school, through its spokesperson, Femi Atoyebi, described the incident as “the unfortunate death of the student.” The varsity stated, “Contrary to what is trending, the university affirms that there is no cultism in the institution, just as the university has zero tolerance for any sort of anti-social vices and misconduct. It is important to stress that the expelled students do not belong to any cult group. “What actually happened is that the deceased was alleged to have stolen a mobile telephone, but instead of reporting the issue to the university management, the expelled students could not control their emotions. Their actions led to the unfortunate death of the student. “The university has taken swift action by handing over all the students involved to the Nigeria Police Force for investigation, with the assurance that justice will be served.” However, Nigerians have continued to demand thorough investigation and justice for the slain student. Leading the pack is an activist of Itsekiri in the Warri Kingdom, identified as @Lord_of_Warri, who, in a letter titled, “An open letter to His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State: Regarding the tragic murder of Prince Alex Timileyi of the Warri Kingdom at Crowther University, Oyo State,” described the slain student as a prince and a first cousin to the Olú of Warri Kingdom, Ogíamè Atuwatsé III. The letter was copied to the X.com handles of the state governor, the Nigeria Police, President Bola Tinubu, and the Department of State Services, among others. The activist lamented that the death of the student had left an indelible mark on the Itsekiri people, urging the governor to “ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice.” The tweet partly read, “This incident has left us deeply saddened and concerned about the safety and security of students in schools not just in Oyo State but in Nigeria as a whole. As Itsekiri people, we appeal to you, the Governor of Oyo State, Makinde, to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice.” He demanded that security operatives “conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and ensure that justice is served. The perpetrators of this heinous act must be held accountable and face the full wrath of the law. We cannot allow the murder of an Itsekiri prince to go unpunished. “It is important for His Excellency to know that the Yoruba and Itsekiri people are one and the same. Allowing these murderers to go free would be equivalent to allowing the killers of your family members to go unpunished, without seeking justice.” @Jessica_Egbedi wrote, “Now he’s dead, so sad... Why didn’t they just hand him over to the school authority?” “I feel traumatised watching this video. There is no difference between them (the suspects) and Boko Haram. I think tyranny and lawlessness are prevalent traits in an average Nigerian. “We may not have confidence in @PoliceNG to meet justice, but that does not justify taking the law into our hands,” @Jojo_Amandy partly wrote. Also, @FaventM posted, “The ‘leaders’ of tomorrow. Most are born into comfort but lack basic etiquette. From the ghetto to the affluent environment, it is all cocktails of bad behavior; they only differ in forms and shapes.” Another tweep who posts by name @HENRYDAVIE10116 said, “This is not a good image for the Anglican Church University. I am sure that the church’s fathers will sanction the management and carry out a thorough investigation into the management of the hostels and student affairs in the university.”",

        "content": "The Benue State House of Assembly has repealed the law for lifetime pension and other benefits of former elected governors and their deputies. Recall that few days to the end of the last assembly, lawmakers passed the controversial pension bill to extend benefits to ex-elected governors and their deputies from 1999. Titus Uba, the 2023 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was the speaker of the assembly. But, during plenary on Monday, May 27, 2024, the assembly repealed the bill passed into law by their predecessors on account that it was not done in good faith. The lawmakers said the law was anti-people and they were unanimous in support of the repeal after several contributions from members of the House. Speaker of the House, Aondona Dajoh, ruled in favour of the unanimous resolution of the House to repeal the “Bill for a law to repeal provision for the maintenance of former elected governors of the state and their deputies and for other matters connected thereto 2024.” The bill had stipulated conditions of the law to include, payment of monthly stipend as basic pensions for former governors and their deputies, equivalent to the current salaries of the serving governor, from the consolidated revenue of the state. Other benefits include: “A monthly stipend equivalent to the basic salary of a serving/incumbent Governor in the State for life and which shall be a charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State. “The deputy governor shall enjoy a monthly stipend equivalent to the Basic salary of an incumbent Deputy Governor for life and shall be charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State. “A maintenance allowance of N25,000,000.00 (Twentyfive Million Naira) for the former Governor and the Deputy Governor N15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Naira) every four (4) years.” It also offers the “procurement of two official SUVs of the status of the former governor and one official car for the deputy governor while the state government is mandated to avail a former governor with six personal staff, one personal assistant, two drivers, two cleaners and one cook.” A former deputy governor, according to the law, will enjoy three personal staff, one personal assistant, one driver and one cleaner. “There will also be provision of security, yearly medical expenses, replacement of vehicles every four years with new ones of same quality and status,” the old law stipulated.",

        "content": "Sanda Island, located just off the southern coast of Mull of Kintyre and is in Argyll and Bute, has gone up for sale for a staggering £2.5 million. The stunning island, which is around 453 acres in total, boasts incredible views from its multiple hills - the highest being 23 meters above sea level. Sanda is accessible via boat as it has two slipways, one north and one south on the island, that run out from its beautiful sandy beaches. READ MORE: Private island with stunning scenery nestled in a Scottish loch hits the market Along with the breathtaking views, there are seven cottages on the island, four of which are based at the island's northern end while three are next to the lighthouse in the south. Most of the houses have been renovated by the current owners which includes the installation of double glazing, shower rooms and underfloor electric heating. There are also two smaller islands north of Sanda, Sheep and Glunimore, which are also included in the sale. Sheep Island is the larger of the two at 31 acres while Glunimore Island is just 4 acres, but both offer their own charming scenery and views. The island was previously owned in the 60s by the famous Scottish musician Jack Bruce, who was the lead vocalist and ‍bassist ‍of the iconic rock band Cream. It is now home to some equally incredible wildlife such as Puffins, Storm petrels, Razorbills, Manx shearwaters, Kittiwakes, Gulliemots, Great black-backed gulls, Shags, and Black guilliemot. It even has a small functioning farm which is home to 55 black-faced sheep and has a registered farm code which even receives a subsidy. The seven homes, lighthouse, and farm are all connected by tracks which can be accessed easily by quadbikes and there is even a helipad to help gain access to the island. The beautiful island overlooks the channel between mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland and is mainly accessed from Campbeltown. The lucky next owner will have incredible views of the Antrim Hills and the beautiful beaches on Carskiey. They will even have a unique view of the Isle of Arran.",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday.",
        "content": "PARIS — Rafael Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavorable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. — Reuters",

        "content": "An economist and Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf speaks to DANIEL AYANTOYE about the performance of President Bola Tinubu President Bola Tinubu will be one year in office on May 29, how will you assess his performance? Performance review of one year of the current administration requires proper contextualisation. There were significant legacy issues that significantly impacted performance outcomes, especially from a macroeconomic point of view. There was a legacy of an incredibly dysfunctional foreign exchange market riddled with round-tripping and all manners of malpractices. Secondly, there was a fuel subsidy regime which created opportunities for corruption and bleeding of the country. The state of affairs in the sector was a major disincentive to investors in the downstream oil sector. The sector became a hotbed of corruption of a huge proportion. The huge backlog of mature foreign exchange obligations was more than $7bn. This created a major liquidity crisis in the economy. There was vandalisation of oil production facilities with incredible impunity. The administration has made significant progress in restoring some sanity to the oil-producing areas, even though it is a work in progress. How will you describe the economic impact of some of the policies and reforms introduced by the government since assumption? The truth is that reforms take time to be prepared and executed. It could take an even longer time for the results to be felt. But my view is that the reforms will necessarily pull back the economy from the brink. Much has been achieved with fiscal consolidation. Government revenue has improved significantly following the reforms. There were also tax reform initiatives. The point to stress is that much of the first year was devoted to corrective reforms which were in many instances also painful. But the reforms were inevitable. Will you say the policies have had any significant impact on the economy? They have had an impact because if those policies were not introduced, the economy would have been worse off than what we have now. This is because before he took over, the Central Bank of Nigeria was practically financing the government through the Ways and Means, and that is why the Ways and Means financing got to almost N30tn by the end of that administration. This is why the fiscal space for the government was extremely very tight because we are spending almost 80 per cent of our revenue on subsidy. Not just subsidy, but even corruption is also related to the subsidy. So, the reforms that have been introduced, has helped us to improve the fiscal space. Government has more revenue and the FAAC has increased; almost tripled, and the need to borrow from the CBN has reduced. The level of deficit is likely to go down. From a revenue or fiscal consolidation point of view, there has been a remarkable movement from where we were. Then all the challenges of the foreign exchange market and corruption in the foreign exchange market; all of those things reduced drastically. Investors now have a lot more confidence. The administration has been able to clear the backlog of maturing obligations in the foreign exchange market which was also creating a confidence crisis before the administration came. So, those things have had some good impact. But I must admit that they have also come with a lot of hardship through the high prices of commodities, the high cost of fuel, and transportation costs. Well, there is a price for everything. That is the price we have to pay at least to bring the economy back on track. The hardship has put many into abject poverty. Why do you think it is difficult for previous and current administrations to put an end to the suffering of the people or bring it to a bearable level? It is not easy because one of the biggest problems in poverty is inflation. Since inflation is still high, purchasing power will be weak. People will not be able to consume much. That is why it is good for the government to focus on economic stability bringing down inflation. The second thing is the issue of food insecurity. Insecurity is a major problem as far as food production is concerned because if the farmers are not producing enough, how can they sell at a cheaper rate? These are problems that the government is trying to solve and these are not things that you can solve very quickly. There is no quick fix to them. Do you think the situation could have been better handled than this? The administration could do better about the speed of delivering mitigating measures to ease the pains of the reforms. There is also the need to address the volatility in the foreign exchange market. Frequent swings in the exchange rate are very detrimental to business because of the uncertainty that comes with it. The CBN should also address the frequent changes in the exchange rate for import duty computation. Subsidy removal, electricity tariff hike, and taxation are some of the policies that Nigerians have described as anti-people. What is your take on this? My take is that the government has set up a tax reform committee. I think we should wait for the outcome of the report of that committee. One of the mandates given to the committee is to streamline the taxes so that you can put an end to the multiple taxations. Let’s see what comes out of that report. The committee has finished its assignment and they are about to present their report to the President. I am sure the outcome will address some of these issues. Do we need electricity tariffs to increase at this time? That is a chicken and egg situation because the electricity people are saying that they are not able to cover their costs. Therefore they are not able to invest in infrastructure and things that will ensure steady power. The citizens are complaining that the burden on them is too much. So, it is a tricky situation. That will require some government intervention to see how we can have a balance. However, the electricity company needs to invest more equity into the business because some of them don’t have that capacity, and it is also important to address the inefficiency problem in the electricity sector. At the same time, the tariff must be such that the electricity sector is sustainable. Three years ahead for the first tenure of President Tinubu. What is the way forward? The way forward is for us to first address this issue of cost of living. That is extremely very important because citizens are still groaning because of the high cost of living. He will have to look at bringing down the cost of living, the cost of transportation, and particularly the cost of food. We need to accelerate the process to ensure that we increase the oil output so that oil production can come close to at least 1.8 or 1.2 million barrels per day. If we can do that, we will be able to get more foreign exchange to stablise our currency. The government needs to do more about insecurity which is a major issue to investors. We know they are doing something but they need to do a lot more. Then the Central Bank needs to do more frameworks to ensure some measure of stability in the foreign exchange market. We need to reduce the volatility in the market. Finally, we need to fix the customs duty exchange rate so that we can reduce the duty on clearing cargo at the ports.",

        "content": "AL-Latiff Tetteh Amanor, the Ningo-Prampram District Chief Executive (DCE), says the assembly was clearing squatters from agricultural lands as they are hindering agricultural activities in the area. Mr Amanor said the lands in Dawhenya were fertile and could do all-year farming, hence the need to preserve them for the area to contribute its quota to the agricultural sector of the country. He said this during the commissioning of 100 hectares of land for a rice seed project, an initiative by the South Korea Agricultural Ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana, aimed at producing high-quality rice seeds in the country. The DCE mentioned that he had been in talks with the Traditional Council on steps to take to preserve the agricultural lands in the district to create farming jobs and support the local economy. “I have been telling the traditional rulers that all our lands can’t go in for concrete; I mean estate projects, so our district is wholeheartedly supporting Agric and agricultural projects,” he stated. He pledged that all government projects regarding agriculture would be sustained, stressing that the district had taken it upon itself to chase the encroaches out of the district. Nene Tetteh Kodie Aden IV, Chief of Dawhenya, said the Dawhenya Irrigation Scheme had been of great benefit to the farmers and the various communities in the district at large. “For some of us, the Dawhenya Irrigation Scheme has been some oxygen to our lives since the very day we visited this earth till now; for that matter, we’ll do everything within our power and our means to ensure that the scheme is sustained,” he stated. He stated that the people of Dawhenya were glad to have had their agriculture sector enhanced by the Korean K-Ricebelt outfit and thanked them for the huge investment they were injecting into the Ghanaian economy. He pleaded with the government to intervene in the threat being posed to the farmlands by the encroaches and appealed to the authorities and the Korean Embassy to extend their support to education, health, and sanitation to spread development in the entire district.",

        "content": "Alstom – Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen-powered train in service in the Americas, finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Alstom, global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, announced today that , the first hydrogen-powered train in revenue service in the Americas, ranked finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas list highlights ambitious projects that are helping shape the world. “We are proud that the Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen train in revenue service in the Americas, has been recognized on the list of Fast Company World Changing Ideas,” said Michael Keroullé, President Alstom Americas. “This is a testament to green energy innovation happening across the Americas, and to the expertise of suppliers and staff at Alstom who are working every day to bring low-carbon transportation options to communities around the globe.” “I was struck this year by the global sweep of the honorees,” says Fast Company editor-in-chief Brendan Vaughan. “It’s endlessly inspiring to see how the world is coming together to devise inventive solutions to our most challenging problems. We need ideas from everywhere, and this year’s World Changing Ideas Awards are an extraordinary encapsulation of the innovation and creativity that is so abundant around the globe.” President Alstom Americas, said: We congratulate the winner in the Transportation category, as well as other finalists and nominees. We are delighted to have been ranked in the top 5 among such innovative transportation projects. Alstom’s Coradia iLint is the first hydrogen-powered train to carry ticketed passengers in the Americas. It transported over 10,000 passengers in a demonstration project in that ran from mid-June to the end of September 2023. Alstom’s Green Innovation Centre partnered with Train de Charlevoix, Accelera by Cummins, HTEC, Harnois Energies and institutional partners, as well as the Quebec Government and the Hydrogen Research Institute of the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. These partnerships created an agile turnkey operation and ecosystem, enabled to deliver this successful demonstration project. The hydrogen fuel cell-powered train emits only water and can produce its electricity through green hydrogen made from renewable resources. The Coradia iLint enables sustainable train operation while ensuring the highest levels of performance and comfort. Over the span of four months, the Coradia iLint saved 8,400 liters of diesel and averted the emission of 22 tons of CO2 in comparison to the same number of trips made by a diesel train in the UNESCO’s Biosphere Reserve of Charlevoix, where Train de Charlevoix operates. In addition, Alstom and its partners welcomed thirty-four commercial, governmental and regulatory delegations from all over North America to experience this hydrogen-propulsion technology, setting the stage for wider implementation of green transit across North America. The Coradia iLint was also the first hydrogen-powered train in the world in passenger service, and we have now reached 2.8 million km in service in total on hydrogen. Alstom was listed as one of Fast Company’s World’s in March 2024, and the Coradia iLint demonstration project in the Americas also won the Environmental Sustainability Award, and the 2023 from the Canadian Hydrogen Convention.

        "content": "Offaly under-20 manager Leo O’Connor admits that the heartbreaking defeat in the 2022 minor final is a motivational factor as they face Tipperary again this Saturday. Despite there being eight All-Ireland SFC fixtures this weekend, the All-Ireland under-20 hurling final between Offaly and Tipperary is expected to draw the biggest crowd, with UPMC Nowlan Park’s 26,000 capacity set to be tested. The two counties met in the minor final two years ago, with many of the same players featuring on both sides, as Tipp dramatically snatched victory in the last play of the game through a Paddy McCormack goal. READ MORE: 'They had to dance in the dark up here for a couple of days' Wexford boss Keith Rossiter on pitch after Springsteen concert READ MORE: Wexford take 'consolation prize' as Kilkenny march into another Leinster final It was controversial, however, with the goal coming off a free awarded seconds after Offaly were denied one themselves. “It’s a motivating factor for the lads, no doubt about it, what happened in 2022,” said O’Connor, who was minor manager at the time before taking over the under-20s. “The last puck of the ball, but we’ve all taken our learnings from it and used it as an experience.” Tipp came through the Munster final last Friday night, beating Cork by a point in a thrilling climax, albeit not without controversy again as an umpiring error denied Ben O’Connor’s side a clear goal. “I just think Tipp worked really hard the other night,” said O’Connor, a former Limerick hurler now resident in Newport, Co Tipperary. “They took the opportunities that became available to them. “I suppose it’s like ourselves, they got a bit of luck and when you get the luck, that’s something you’ve to take. “We haven’t got our luck in All-Ireland finals in the last two years and, look, we’ll perform, we’ll turn up, we always do. That’s what this team is a trademark for us. “From that point of view, we’re really happy to be in a good situation where we’re at at the moment.” Offaly lost last year’s under-20 final to Cork, with referee Chris Mooney shipping criticism for his handling of the game but a more experienced whistler has been appointed this time, with Sean Stack, another Dublin official though a native of Clare, handed the task. Speaking before the appointment had been made, O’Connor stressed the need for an experienced referee to take charge of the game. He said: “Our experiences over the last two years, being below in Nowlan Park with a huge crowd, very tight ground, and it creates a very unique atmosphere and certainly, the Offaly support has been absolutely massive and the same below in Thurles last year, a huge Offaly crowd. “One of the things is the experience that senior inter-county referees really have in dealing with that situation so I just think it is very, very important that the right man is put in charge next weekend and with experience, that is able to handle the situation. “There’s too much being put into it for it to be not done properly at this stage.” Although Offaly retained their Leinster title with a three-point win over Dublin in front of more than 15,000 last Wednesday, O’Connor insists that they’ll need to play to a far higher level against Tipp to take the county’s first title at this grade. He added: “We’ve got to improve. All the opportunities that come available to us, we’ve got to take them. “I actually don’t think that we have really played to our full potential and that’s the one thing, the bit of confidence of beating Kilkenny, getting over the line against Dublin the other night, that’s going to be really important going forward.” To keep up to date with all the latest GAA news, sign-up to our GAA newsletter here.",

        "content": "Berlin considers setting up a over Ukraine, as Vladimir Zelensky has requested, to be a step too far, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Monday. Speaking to the New York Times last week, the Ukrainian leader argued that NATO countries should shoot down Russian missiles from their own territory, just as the US and UK had done with Iranian missiles and drones aimed at Israel. Hebestreit told reporters in Berlin. His comments come two days after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg likewise rejected the notion, telling the German outlet Welt am Sonntag that the US-led bloc Stoltenberg insisted that Instead, the US-led bloc’s chief has proposed agreeing to another of Zelensky’s requests, to lift the supposed restrictions on the use of NATO-provided weapons on what it considers Russian soil. Some of the bloc’s members have already pushed back against the notion, however. Hebestreit dodged the question about whether Kiev had given Berlin assurances that it would not strike Russian territory with German-supplied weapons, saying such arrangements were NATO has also pledged to send Kiev ever more weapons, ammunition and equipment, even as its stockpiles are running dry. Stoltenberg has floated a five-year plan to provide Ukraine with €100 billion ($108 billion) in military aid, but some members of the bloc reportedly have concerns about where the money would come from. Moscow has repeatedly warned that such deliveries would merely prolong the fighting, without changing the outcome, and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",

        "description": "Writer and Dublin resident Bill Barich on what made Laughing in the Hills, the story of a mid-range Californian racetrack, such an enduring classic.",
        "content": "IT WAS LATE afternoon in Northern California and Bill Barich had his waders on to go fishing. For much of the last five years he had dedicated himself, both on bitterly cold mornings and drawn out evenings such as this, to the pursuit of steelhead trout. He didn’t consider himself a particularly good fisherman, but these trout had proven a more evasive target than even he had first cared to imagine. They clung to the river bed, immune to what he had to offer them. Travelling from the Pacific Ocean to this stretch of water to spawn they had no desire to be disturbed by him. Stood on the decking that bordered two sides of the mobile home he rented with his wife on a 14-acre plot, he could see the Russian River below that they had inhabited and he would shortly head toward. All around him was the untouched beauty of Sonoma County and it gladdened Bill’s heart when he looked out from here how much it reminded him of landscapes he had experienced in Italy years earlier. The trailer itself (to call it a mobile home is perhaps too grandiose) was shoddy, but nice. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms and there was a hole in a wall where Bill had flung a boxed manuscript only to discover the fragility of plasterboard. For $200 a month, however, Bill and his wife could overlook any shortcomings. Out there in the countryside, one encountered other people with the same regularity that steelhead trout made themselves known to Bill. This sense of being somewhat removed from the world was welcome. A shared sense of devastation had brought them here. They had lost and were losing close family members to cancer, suffered through miscarriages, and Bill’s wife had undergone what transpired to be unnecessary surgery for a misdiagnosed brain tumor. They had decided that 12 months should be enough to work through what they were feeling, but for the next five years they would call this place home. One cold morning down on the Russian, Bill had encountered (or had been encountered, really) a local who’s knowledge of the steelhead trout far surpassed his own. Had Bill’s struggles not been so apparent, they may have parted company there and then. Instead, he came away with some essential insight to the ways of this fish. If you want to tempt them up, he was told, you would need the roe of a female steelhead, the eggs from her ovaries. And it needed to be fixed to a gold hook he was informed, “otherwise you’re wasting your time”. Fishing had become analogous to writing for Bill. He had left his job in the publishing industry to spend those initial 12 months writing a novel. When one year became two, three and then four, he delivered a novel for each of them. Publishers repeatedly told him that they liked his writing, but something about his fiction just didn’t land. Not to be deterred, he changed his approach. If they liked his writing but not what his imagination had to offer, he would find something else to write about. Something real. As he stood there in his waders about to go fishing, he had figured out how to catch steelhead trout, and his first work of non-fiction had broken through. , a book which recounted his 10-week experience of the 1979 season at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Fields race track would be in book stores soon, and Viking Press had paid him $1,500 for the privilege of publishing it. He hadn’t yet left for the river when the phone started ringing and his wife, who was in the house and answered, called out to him. “Bill, it’s Mr Shawn,” he heard. For almost 30 years William Shawn had been the editor of magazine. Bill’s literary agent had told him that they had been interested in serialising his book, but this was the first conversation he would have with a man who had published everyone from Hannah Arendt to John Updike. In his high-pitched voice and with an unbreakable formality, Mr Shawn spent the next 10 minutes or so explaining how much he had enjoyed to a largely silent Mr Barich. “And we’ll pay you a minimum of $25,000,” the editor said, bringing the conversation to a close and Bill back to his senses. “But my agent told me it was $2,500,” he replied, stunned that the “twenty-five” his agent had been quoted represented an amount unfamiliar to both of them when was concerned. Shawn could only chuckle as this realisation dawned on his newest author and when the phone call ended. Bill, waders still on, decided there was nothing for it but to go fishing. Serialisation in brought Bill Barich’s work immediate and widespread recognition, but it is the book has led both of us to a Dublin hotel café almost half-a-century after its publication. I spend more time than I care to mention (and more money than is wise to count) searching online for old American sports books. It is through this habit that I have encountered David Halberstam’s writing on baseball, Ken Dryden’s remarkable hockey memoir, Frederick Exely’s and most importantly of all, Barich’s s. It had been included on a list Sports Illustrated compiled of the Top 100 Sports Books, and the accompanying blurb seemed at once a touch sensational, but compelling: “Nearing 40 and faced with the death of his mother and a failing marriage, Barich checks into a hotel near Golden Gate Fields racetrack and stays for the season. As he gambles alongside a flock of railbirds, he becomes, he says in this evocative memoir, ‘restored if not renewed.’” As it turned out, he was still a few years shy of 40, it was a motel that he stayed in, and although Barich and his wife would separate it seems presumptuous to describe their marriage as failing based on what we read alone. All the same, I was sold on the premise. The book that followed exceeded all expectations. What I find appeals to me about these old American sports books is their finality. When Halberstam writes about Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio in , I read it knowing that the story has been played out to its fullest. I might find myself hoping things turn out well for some characters over others, but the overwhelming satisfaction of stepping into these sporting stories comes with the certainty that there is no uncertainty. They do not possess the same possibilities for joy and anxiety as actual sport, but the best of those books are not worse off for that. Indeed, they are a welcome escape from that. So far removed in time and place, the measure of their success has less to do with what a team or athlete achieved than how well the writer can tell that story. It was unnerving to then discover that the author of had breached this distinction. For almost 20 years before I had encountered Bill Barich’s work, he had been living in Dublin. In an instant he had ceased to be an abstract figure who had written a brilliant sports book in the late 1970s. It sounds naïve to have never considered that these worlds would interject. Yet, as I watched him walk toward me on a Tuesday morning to a semi-secluded table in the café, it required a conscious leap of logic to associate the man from the book with the Bill Barich now sat opposite me. He is a quietly charming man in his 81st year. There’s little outward trace of the ordeals that he worked through over the course of his book. As he patiently recounts those scenes from decades ago, his memories almost seem to be of an eccentric friend he once knew. Yet, his life changed with the creation of . An aspiring writer who became a published author, the serialisation of the book led to a staff writer job at . Numerous other successful books followed and Barich inched ever further away from the desperate man who had taken his final shot with a book about a mid-range horse track. As he speaks, his attention is drawn to the copy of the book that has been left sitting on the table between us. It is a 2015 reprint that he helped to design himself; the choice of an Edgar Degas painting for the cover was his own, he proudly explains. Degas was only a few years younger painting (‘The Parade’) (1866-68) than Barich had been writing the book. Taking us from the grandstand onto the yellowy grass of the track, Degas shows us six horses and their jockeys in various states of readiness for a race that has yet to begin. The two foregrounded appear stood still. Another two calmly walk in our direction, while the final pair of these jockeys look to be in conversation as their horses move along parallel to one another. This is a seven-horse meet, however, and Degas has instilled a little chaos. The final horse portrayed is closest to the centre of the painting, but it is also the farthest away. The jockey’s clothing – a brownish top and red cap – almost blends in with the autumnal backdrop, but the dark colour of the horse’s coat keeps him in view. Contrary to the calmness of those first six horses, the seventh is panicked and its jockey is desperately trying to bring it back under control. That this wildness is not immediately apparent on first glance feels important. Degas almost allows it to be lost in the beautiful scenery of the Parisian racetrack. Furthermore, it is striking that not one of the other six horses or jockeys appear even to have noticed the struggle that is ongoing. And while Degas’ portrayal of the crowd is vague in that Impressionist style, we can make out enough to realise that there has been no swell of interest on their behalf either. “It was as though many versions of reality were competing for a chance to obtain,” wrote Barich of his initial sensation looking out at the racetrack from the Golden Gate Fields grandstand one hundred years removed from this painting. “I stood there paralyzed, unable to make a choice.” Degas and Barich transmit a shared understanding of the possibilities open to an inquisitive mind at the racetrack. Degas allows himself is a snapshot; one scene in which any number of stories could be told. Barich goes deeper. He brings the horses, their jockeys and the myriad other individuals whose existence interweaves with the track to life. The wildness of Degas’ seventh horse would have been of concern to anyone with money on it. Barich introduces us to these people. There would have been a trainer and groom concerned with why their horse had reacted this way. Barich takes us into their barn. And those people in the crowd whom Degas presents as an anonymous whole, Barich gives them specificity and meaning. The racetrack contains multitudes. Barich unpacks them. Fishing and writing demand patience. So does picking horses. Bill Barich rediscovered the thrill of horse racing throughout the heartbreaking period that his terminally ill mother was slowly taken from him. It started as an occasional wager made at an Off-Track Betting office where his family lived in New York. Soon enough, Bill was driving to the local newsagents every morning to pick up a copy of the Daily Racing Form. Opening it up on the kitchen table, he would lose himself in the details trying to figure out which horses to back. It felt to him that a successful process should be attainable through logic, but could equally be undone through chance. When some family members surprised him by asking to place bets of their own, both the scientific and scattershot methods of picking winners were tested. Once all bets were in, the family would gather together around Bill’s dying mother on the porch and listen to the delayed radio broadcast of the races. “My father said the races were good for her,” he wrote. “I thought [my mother] heard in the track announcer’s call a little pulse of life at the heart of the cancer.” From the kitchen table of his family home in New York to a motel room not far from the Golden Gate Fields racetrack in Albany, California, Bill continued picking horses. He had sold Viking Press on the idea of a non-fiction book and it would involve him spending 10 weeks at a racetrack. There was a part of him that welcomed the time it would offer to really work on his process for picking horses. But there was something greater in the idea that the “little pulse of life” his mother experienced could contain an interior life of its own to be explored. He was not of the horse racing world, nor did he typically frequent racetracks or even know many racing people. When he descended on Golden Gate Fields with the purpose of finding material for a book, it was as a complete unknown. “Joan Didion said about people talking to her because she seems so harmless,” he says, suggesting that his presence was similarly inoffensive to this community of racing people. He refused to carry a notebook for fear that people might consider him a journalist, or worse, a cop. “There’s a lot of things that were going on, particularly at a track like Golden Gate Fields,” he continues, “that people don’t generally want you to know about.” The conversations he had or overheard were only written down in the seclusion of a nearby bar or his motel room. With time, his continual presence at the racetrack inspired more curiosity than suspicion from both the patrons and those working there alike. “You go back to the same barn a fourth time,” he explains, noting that racetracks like Golden Gate Fields didn’t contain owners, trainers and grooms who were commonly sought out for conversations about their work, “they just say, ‘OK, we’ll talk to you.’” What transpired in the form of was an exploration of what goes into the day-to-day running of a racetrack. Using his naivety as an asset, Barich asked simple questions that most readers probably didn’t know the answers to either. There was an unquestionable ordinariness to what he was discovering, but as with the details he pored over looking for clues in a horse’s form, his observations served as an extension of his attempts to finesse the process. To see how a horse is treated when it is not racing, to speak candidly with those working long hours for mediocre pay, or to gain some understanding of the ways horses can be chemically enhanced, it all helps to establish what is in a sense one man’s (ultimately unsuccessful) manual on picking horses. Yet, this sense should not be overplayed. is as much a treatise on gambling as is a guidebook for whaling; some good insights of both are contained within, but it’s scarcely the point. “That book is incredibly compressed, but I wanted it to be like that,” he explains. “I wanted there to be no waste.” It can be therefore difficult to distinguish between the composite parts of and the book in its totality. Structurally, it is broken down into 10 chapters. One for each week he spent at the track, perhaps, although linearity isn’t something that always concerns him. Within each chapter he decided to break things down further into sub-sections; each like a race on a given day’s card. In this sense, it is easy to regard the book as almost a series of Degas’ snapshots from the racetrack. The reader is never asked to focus for too long on one particular subject, and that staccato style can generate the feeling that one’s flying through all the action. However, as with the wild horse that Degas almost allows you to overlook in the background, Barich has an ability to show you worlds within worlds across a matter of paragraphs. His face shows the hint of a smile as I mention the man he encountered in the parking lot of his motel one afternoon. A globe salesman that mistook Bill for a thief, he remembers being briefly overwhelmed by the sight of so many globes in the man’s car when its owner emerged from his room. Inebriated (or working toward it), this guy started raising hell. When Bill explained that he too was a resident of the motel and didn’t mean any harm, the salesman’s anger turned to the deepest guilt. He insisted that Bill accept his offer of a free globe by way of apology. The scene had all the quality of a short story, and Bill’s assessment of the man’s behaviour wonderfully surmised his rapid change of heart: “Minor judgmental errors tend to unhinge men who’ve been drinking alone in motel rooms since two in the afternoon.” Like Degas, Barich can give us just enough information to know what is happening, but only some indication or inference of what might happen next. It is best to approach the question of its totality through the style in which it was written. Barich wasn’t a journalist, but his writing fit within the New Journalism stylings of the era. He insists that this owed more to his work as a novelist than his adherence to any creative credo, but what Tom Wolfe noted in his famed collection of New Journalism works a few years earlier resonated with Barich’s work in the late 1970s: “[Writers of New Journalism] developed the habit of staying with the people they were writing about for days at a time, weeks in some cases. They had to gather all the material the conventional journalist was after – and then keep going. It seemed all important to when dramatic scenes took place, to get the dialogue, the gestures, the facial expressions, the details of the environment. The idea was to give the full objective description, plus something that readers had always had to go to novels and short stories for: namely, the subjective or emotional life of the characters. That was why it was so ironic when both the journalistic and literary old guards began to attack this new journalism as ‘impressionistic’. The most important things one attempted in terms of technique depended upon a depth of information that had never been demanded in newspaper work.” As was the case for certain prominent purveyors of this style, Barich assumes the role of the book’s central character around which all events take place. However, unlike Hunter S Thompson or Wolfe himself, Barich’s presence is not overwhelming. Indeed, Barich’s reader is afforded a dual role as the audience for which he is writing, but also as a player in the process of acquiring the information that will come to be written about. Whatever rules New Journalism broke in turn of reporting and technique, the material that could be unearthed (and the unearthing of that material) was of primary importance. What Wolfe described as “the juice”. To the extent then that tells a story from Golden Gate Fields, Bill’s discovery of Pichi shaped the narrative course of the book. She was an unruly horse brought to Gary Headley’s stable. What Degas left to the imagination, Barich brings to life. Pichi’s concerned owners turned to Headley and his captivating groom, Bo Twinn in the hope that they could salvage the genealogical pedigree this wild horse possessed and turn it into a winner. In a book that never really intends to tug at sentimentality, it almost worried Barich when he succumbed to the pull of Pichi and this traditional underdog story. When people speak to him now about the book, it is Pichi that they almost inevitably mention. And he has learned to be at ease with that for it remains a remarkable story. “God know what Gary Headley gave her,” he says with a laugh, “but it worked!” There is another aspect of that unsettles its categorisation as a sports book. Too prominent to have been overlooked by the blurb-writer at , it can only have been a choice to not include it. Bill Barich spends a considerable portion of this book writing about Florence during the Renaissance. When he considers that decision now, there is no doubt in his mind that it was correct. “Well, I thought I may never write another book,” he says, “so I figured I’d put everything I know into this one.” Some readers had trouble reading of a mid-range Californian racetrack one moment, before being asked to consider the author’s portrayal of 15th and 16th century Florentine artists the next. I would argue that this facet of Barich’s creativity is what turns from a very good sports book into an exceptional one. Weaving both worlds together when he locates a suitable point of intersection, he is as comfortable dedicating standalone sections of the book to some aspect of Florence’s rich history. They are both remarkably compelling and open-minded. Barich continually invites the reader to become an interpreter. Through some act of serendipity, I had encountered – knowing nothing of it beyond what the blurb detailed – not too long after visiting Florence for the first time. “I chose to live in... the legendary Florence of Lorenzo the Magnificent,” he wrote in a chapter dedicated to the months he spent living there as an exchange student in the 1960s. My visit only lasted a few days, but his intention rang true. Florence, with its remarkable artwork and history, encourage such duality of thought. You walk through the city as it stands today, constantly aware of those who walked before you. It reveals itself to you as you project your own thoughts upon it. just took that all out,” he says, all references to Florence removed from the two-magazine run it was published across. “That was brutal.” While his experience publishing the book with Viking was arduous in the way one might expect, presented an altogether tougher challenge. It would be unfair to suggest that he was misled, but Shawn’s lavish praise for had given Barich cause to assume that there would only be so much that needed changing. “You have to debate everything,” he says, “from commas to semi-colons.” And then there were the fact-checkers. A necessary process, Barich nevertheless found himself answering questions about how a particular trainer might take to being described as “flakey” (“He’s a racetrack guy, he’s been called worse, believe me!”) and that it’s generally considered better not to describe someone as bald if it can be avoided at all (“It’s deeply offensive, apparently”). On and on, with manuscripts being sent back and forth between their offices in New York City and Bill’s home in the Californian countryside, it severely tested his patience. “I wasn’t about to roll over though,” he says. “I was very happy to be taken seriously.” When it was eventually published across two magazines in April and May 1980, the effect it had on his personal and professional life was transformative. “It actually ended up being around $35,000,” he says, an even greater amount than he had been able to contemplate when he first got the call from Shawn. With that enormous payday, Bill and his wife departed their trailer overlooking the river on a 14-acre plot of land in Sonoma County for a house in the suburbs (that didn’t last long). The following year he would have four articles in and by 1982 he even had two pieces of his fictional writing published there too. More books would shortly follow. His writing eventually featured in collections like and , and in recent years he has even worked as a screenwriter for the HBO show, . He had always regarded as something of a last shot at making it, unaware then of whatever that entailed and where it could take him. As we prepare to leave the café, I realise that I haven’t really asked Bill how he ended up living in Dublin. The great contradiction of is how he took an enormous risk in the real life sense while remaining quite a cautious gambler. “Of my initial five hundred dollars,” he wrote in the book’s closing chapter, the set amount he allowed himself from his first day at Golden Gate Fields, “I had three hundred sixty-four dollars left.” It’s always been this way with him, he explains. Like Degas looking at the racetrack from afar, there is some of that wild horse in Bill Barich looking back out at us from within. He has no issue hedging everything on an impulse of the heart. Holidaying in London he met an Irish woman named Imelda, fell in love and decided to act on it. “I had friends who thought I was being rash or just plain foolish,” he later wrote, “but trust and conviction grow if real love is in the mix.” We depart the building and walk a short distance until our paths are set to diverge. He is heading down Anthony Cronin Walk and we briefly discuss , Cronin’s memoir of life in literary Dublin. “I met him once,” Bill says, “I heard he liked horses.”",

The bloc wants to ditch Russian natural gas ideally by 2027, but it will not have weaned off all natural gas by that date, so it could hit the suppliers on which it would depend the most for gas later this decade. “With Europe importing a large part of the fossil energy it consumes, the regulation will also help to reduce methane emissions from imported fossil fuels,” the European Commission said today after the Council adopted the rules. “The regulation will progressively introduce more stringent requirements to ensure that exporters gradually apply the same monitoring, reporting and verification obligations as EU operators,” the Commission added. “To meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, we must cut methane emissions in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. This legislation ensures proper monitoring and addressing of emissions across these value chains,” said Tinne Van der Straeten, the Energy Minister of Belgium, which holds the EU rotating presidency in the first half of the year. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The European Commission for Energy, Kadri Simson, said, “With the final EU adoption of the methane regulation we now have means to get clearer insight into the main sources of methane emissions in the energy sector. This will increase transparency and provide the tools necessary to reduce these potent emissions, both in the EU and globally.” The Commission will review the application of the regulation in 2028, including the level of emissions reduction achieved.

        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "description": "While the pendulum seems to have swung to the ‘life’ side, some wonder if it has gone too far.",
        "content": "Does anyone want to work anymore? Since 2020, we’ve endured a stream of supposed work trends. “Quiet quitting” is among the most prominent. According to TikTok, it’s when you “ .” Gallup recently that “‘quiet quitters’ make up at least 50 per cent of the U.S. workforce — probably more.” Canada is purportedly , with two-thirds of workers quiet quitting. Quiet quitting supposedly reflects a new age of anti-ambition, where “decentering” work is celebrated. As Simone Stolzoff proclaims in his recent book , work-life balance needs a recalibration. “Go for good enough” is now inspirational advice. The message: Work less — and care less about it. While the pendulum seems to have swung to the “life” side, some wonder if it has gone too far. Is work ethic fading? To find out, we partnered with the research firm YouGov to conduct a survey of 5,000 Americans in November of 2023. We then partnered with research firm Angus Reid to replicate that same survey with 2,500 Canadians in May of 2024. We call our study the MESSI ( ). Directly measuring work ethic is challenging. As one indicator, we asked respondents: “How much effort do you put into your job beyond what is required?” If work ethic is waning, most people should answer “none.” But that wasn’t the case — not even close. Even more striking is that the numbers are similar for American and Canadian full-time workers. In both surveys, roughly 52 per cent said “a lot,” 35 per cent said “some,” 10 per cent said “a little,” and a mere 3 per cent said “none.” Has work ethic changed over time? To check, we excavated data from the classic and found Americans were similar to our 2023 MESSI. In 1977, 57 per cent said “a lot,” 36 per cent said “some,” 5 per cent said “a little” and 2 per cent said “none” when asked the same question. As much as things change about the organization and culture of work, the average worker’s willingness to go above and beyond has barely budged. But how can we explain the disconnect between all the these days and workers’ responses about their own work ethic? To find out, in both MESSI surveys we asked: “How much effort do you think the ‘average [American/Canadian] worker’ puts into their job beyond what is required?” In a surprise to likely no one, most people think they work harder than others. While 52 per cent of American and Canadian workers say they personally put a lot of effort into their job beyond what is required, only 13 per cent of all workers believe that the average American or Canadian worker does the same. So, to answer the question about if anyone wants to work anymore, the simple answer is yes. But there is a major disconnect between how hard we say we work and how hard we think others work. We really got a sense of the bad vibes — how lousy it is “out there,” for everyone else — when we asked workers about work ethic. Here’s just a sampling of what people told us. A caterer declared that people “in general these days hate their jobs and don’t want to work at all.” A janitor lamented: “Not many people want to work, and if they do, most of them complain about their work or other people they work with.” And a locksmith added: “Most people are just not interested in working more than they have to.” “I feel attitudes have changed a lot,” a cook explained. “People used to work hard to get their jobs done and were happy with their paycheque. Now a lot of people don’t care, choose when they feel like working, and complain a lot.” A CEO of a roofing company amplified the point: “In an era of rampant poor work ethic, chronic victimhood mentality and the worst combination of self-entitlement with intense envy of what is perceived that everyone else has, most people are unnecessarily miserable at their jobs.” Despite what most Americans and Canadians think, most workers say they are still willing to go above and beyond. On balance, that’s a good thing. Working hard is anchoring for our and motivation. A 67-year-old custodian told us: “Most people, if truthful, don’t work for the money; rather, people derive their satisfaction from the things that come from steady work — pride, personal responsibility, satisfaction and the ability to determine what they want to achieve or accomplish.” The residual aftershocks of the and the so-called have sullied work’s reputation. We believe that a perception-reality check about the state of work ethic is needed to correct the prevalence inflation that sustains the pessimism. Cutting into those bad vibes would be a small step toward repairing work’s damaged reputation.",

All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.”",

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Tickets Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.”",

        "content": "A group calling for lower rates in Dunedin has been told rates affordability needs to be balanced with the increasing costs of delivering core services. The Reduce Rates Group said it asked Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich and city councillors a series of questions. One was whether the council had \"any understanding of the real hardship out there for many of our community\". \"There are many elderly and lower-income citizens who struggle from day to day to make ends meet\", the group said. \"Rate increases are another huge burden and worry for them.\" A council response was not written by the mayor. It came from council staff. \"The council recognises that rates need to be at an affordable level overall, and that it needs to balance affordability with increasing costs of delivering core services\", an unidentified staff member said. \"Residents on low incomes will continue to be encouraged to access the rates rebate scheme offered by central government as a means of offsetting the cost of rates.\" The council has proposed a rates increase of 17.5% and signalled a rise in debt of about $118 million in the next year. Asked about debt levels, the council staff member said this was due to the capital programme the council was delivering, largely in dealing with water, waste and roading. The group agreed on a series of resolutions at a public meeting last month. They included asking the council to recognise a high level of concern about the proposed rates increase and debt levels. The group suggested cutting back, postponing or cancelling non-essential and \"enhancement\" works and that the council look into staffing levels and contractor and consultant performance. \"Please note also that many of us voted for you due to concerns about over-spending by the previous council\", the group told elected representatives during annual plan submissions. The council is deliberating on submissions this week. grant.miller@odt.co.nz",

        "content": "Sally Craik, pictured at the Vauxhall Yacht Club yesterday, will play at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington for the 80th anniversary of D- Day. PHOTO: LINDA ROBERTSON Sally Craik will pipe the international tune The Battles O’er at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington on June 6, leading the 80th anniversary of D-Day’s worldwide commemorations. Ms Craik said she had been preparing for this event for nearly a year. She had previously performed at Larnach Castle for the Queen. \"I have had to practise several hours every week\", she said. \"The tune we are playing is very traditional; the emotions that come from the sound of the bagpipes is really beautiful.\" \"It’s going to be exciting leading the call.\" On June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched the largest amphibious invasion in history, known as Operation Overlord or D-Day. This monumental offensive on the beaches of Normandy marked a turning point in World War 2, paving the way for the eventual liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation. Ms Craik said she was humbled to be able to pay tribute to its history. \"The bagpipes have such a resonant sound; this is a real opportunity for them to be heard. \"I'm quite nervous and excited; it’s also an opportunity to pay tribute to my Scottish heritage.\" As night descends over the Allied nations, the sound of bagpipes will be played in the capital cities on June 6 at 9.10pm, starting in Wellington and then on to Canberra, London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Washington DC, Ottawa, Paris, Brussels, Athens, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo, Warsaw and Prague, and Normandy. Pageant master of D-Day 80 Bruno Peek said the tune had particular significance to the day. \"There were countless acts of bravery that day, one of that stands out was 21-year-old Piper Bill Millin, 1st Special Service Brigade and Personal Piper to Lord Lovat, who came ashore armed with only his bagpipes to play under fire on Sword Beach as his comrades came ashore.\" matthew.littlewood@odt.co.nz",

        "content": "Dunedin artist Shane Legg uses the Sun to create art on wood at the Dunedin Railway Station yesterday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Dunedin artist Shane Legg has been \"painting\" wood art with a magnifying glass for nearly a decade. He has perfected the process over the years, to the point where he could make the magnifying glass paintings \"dance with the light\". \"I call it solar pyrography ... it’s something I learned when I lived up in sunny Twizel. \"I've always been able to draw, but the compelling part for me is the fact I can create something without ever touching the wood.\" He uses a magnifying glass to magnify the light and create a parabola effect, effectively \"drawing with the light\". \"I can paint anything on the wood, but I particularly like painting birds and mountains\", he said. \"I enjoy painting architecture; I like the straight lines of buildings. I also get a lot of commissions for dogs.\" The art required a certain amount of sunlight to be effective, he said. \"I've been a bit unlucky with Dunedin over the past couple of weeks. There hasn't been enough light for my pictures. \"There’s something natural about the finished result, the burning of the wood. \"It’s as quick as a marker pen— and it’s all about angles. \"As the Sun moves, I angle the hand. I don't get shaky hands; I'm pretty fluid — once I've got the wood burning, just the slightest feather of movement creates a wisp.\" The effect was similar to that of a \"human laser\". He advised people to wear protective eyewear, sunblock and have patience to find time to get the right light. \"It’s not that hard to do.

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "content": "A Southland rugby family picked up an extra player 10 days ago, leading to an unexpected double celebratory double. Wyndham prop Brad Shaw said plans were neatly in place for his club of 20 years to mark his 200th game — against old rivals Edendale — when wife Dana went into labour with their third child on May 18. Wyndham rugby player Brad Shaw and baby Marlee fly the flag shortly after her birth at Southland Hospital, before Shaw's 200th game. PHOTOS: SUPPLIED Fortunately — about 2.30am — there were a few hours before he was scheduled to run out to the sound of bagpipes played by son Jack, 8, but Mr Shaw said he gave the midwife a hurry-along nonetheless. \"We’d had about two hours’ sleep when contractions started, so we headed to Southland Hospital and got Dana comfy. \"I told our midwife she had till lunchtime to get the baby out, because we were all off to the rugby at that point.\" In the event, daughter Marlee was born at 8.49am, allowing the family to spend some time together before heading pitch-side for the day’s second celebration. Mrs Shaw said, despite being tempted to sneak along for the special match, she remained in a warm place with baby Marlee. \"I’d had my other two [children, Quinn, 7, and Jack] early as well, so it was kind of expected Marlee might come along early. \"But when I started getting contractions overnight Friday, it was a case of ‘here we go’.\" Brad and Dana Shaw with Marlee. \"We’re all extremely proud of his dedication to the club he loves. \"He started there in 2004 aged 18, and he’s embraced every part of Wyndham RFC. He’s been away for a couple of spells at Eastern Hawks and playing overseas in Holland and Germany, but Wyndham has always been where our family’s heart lies.\" Mr Shaw said it had been a special moment to be piped on to the pitch by his son. \"Once the birth had all gone smoothly, it kind of made me a bit more relaxed about everything. \"To have the wee fellah playing the bagpipes for my 200th game, I can tell you there was a tear not just in my eye, but a few of the players’. That definitely got to a few of us. Jack Shaw pipes his dad on to the field in Brad Shaw’s 200th game for the Wyndham club. Mr Shaw said the match was drawn 20-20, making it a day of doubles all round. Although it was too early to tell where baby Marlee’s talents might lie, Mr Shaw was not immune to being a little superstitious. \"Maybe rugby will be her game. We’ll have to see.\"",

        "description": "Gary Kircher. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Waitaki Mayor Gary Kircher has called a government move to tamper with Māori wards inconsistent and unfair.",
        "content": "Gary Kircher. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Mr Kircher and 51 other mayors and chairmen signed a letter last week to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other ministers. The government is set to introduce legislation in the coming months to restore the ability for communities to petition their councils to hold binding polls on Māori ward decisions. This will include holding binding polls on wards that were established without local referendums being able to take place. Mr Kircher said the government never consulted with councils on the issues and running polls would cost a \"signficant\" amount. \"If they’d come and ask us then they would know the answer is no.\" Māori wards and constituencies are designed to allow Māori to contribute to decision-making and have representation at council. They are voted for on the Māori electoral roll. Candidates do not need to be of mana whenua descent, or Māori. Mr Kircher said Waitaki did not have 10% of its voters on the Māori roll, which meant it would need to increase the number of councillors to facilitate a Māori ward. The council already had 10 councillors, which was high considering the population and it already worked closely with mana whenua. Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and Te Rūnanga o Moeraki chairman Justin Tipa said they had put a lot of time and effort into their relationship with the council across many different kaupapa (policies). Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu had not made any formal statements for or against the legislation. \"Our view is that the Treaty relationship as it relates to local government is between local government authorities and mana whenua. \"It is completely fair for mayors like Gary to speak out when they feel that central government is interfering with their ability to manage their relationships with tangata whenua themselves\", Mr Tipa said. Mr Kircher said the government was overreaching. \"It’s about bringing consistency into it.\" The bill was defended by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who said the \"true democratic process\" would be restored. Mr Kircher said he wondered why Mr Peters did not support the need for a poll for other changes in council issues, such as councillor numbers, ward changes or the creation or abolition of community boards. \"If central government seriously want to give local democracy, then make the polls a requirement for all points or even better make it a requirement for some of the things they do.\" Stuff reported that Local Government Minister Simeon Brown responded to the letter, saying he disagreed with the mayors’ and chairpersons’ assertions. He said the coalition government believed communities should determine whether to introduce Māori wards. \"This government believes in localism and in letting local people decide their constitutional arrangements\", he said.",

        "content": "Dame Lois Muir is presented her Netball New Zealand service award by Silver Ferns Georgia (left) and Kate Heffernan at Dunedin Netball’s celebration of the NNZ centenary at the weekend. PHOTO: DUNEDIN NETBALL The people who are the first to arrive and the last to leave, the ones who give up hours to run the scoreboards, pick up the whistle, offer words of wisdom and everything in between. Dunedin Netball celebrated all those people at a special function on Saturday when the organisation also marked Netball New Zealand becoming the first national netball body to reach 100 years. It was a chance to pay tribute for everyone's invaluable service — some spanning more than 50 years — and also acknowledge the past, present and the future of the sport. Former Otago team photos, uniforms and books were on display. From players, coaches, umpires, support staff, bench officials and more, 27 people from across Otago were recognised with NNZ service awards, including four NNZ life members. Otago coaching great Lois Muir, who was inducted into NNZ hall of fame with icon status earlier this year, was at the top of that list and gladly accepted her award and those of fellow Otago NNZ life members the late Sara Foster, Rena Mackenzie and Margaret McAughtrie. Silver Fern and Southern Steel sisters Kate and Georgia Heffernan — whose mother, Annette, was coached by Muir for the Silver Ferns in the 1980s — presented the awards at the function at the Edgar Centre, adding to a full circle moment for the family. There were special presentations on Sunday for Georgie Salter after the Southern Steel’s win in Dunedin — where they won the Georgina Salter Memorial Trophy — which her family accepted, and for Steel assistant coach Jo Morrison. Dunedin Netball general manager Lee-Anne Anderson said there were many special and emotional moments throughout the event. \"Very special, particularly when Dame Lois is able to come out and celebrate with us\", Anderson said. \"For her to make the effort and to come down and be with us that’s always really special. \"But I think particularly so, there was a number of family members that had received the certificates on behalf of their family members that had passed that was really emotional. \"It was really special seeing them being able accept acknowledgement on behalf of their family members that had done so much for Otago. \"Some of those women never had children so netball was their life and some of those people that did have families ... netball was so much a part of their life it’s almost like they did more with netball than they did sometimes their families.\" Netball New Zealand Honour roll Otago life members: Lois Muir, Sara Foster*, Rena Mackenzie*, Margaret McAughtrie*.

        "content": "Highlander winger Jona Nareki gets past Fiji Drua Flanker Etonia Waqa to score during Sunday’s game at Forsyth Barr Stadium. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH After crushing the Fijian Drua 39-3 at Forsyth Barr Stadium on Sunday, the Highlanders have booked themselves a spot in the Super Rugby Pacific playoffs. The Highlanders, who sit seventh with six wins, were solid across the park. Assistant coach Dave Dillon was pleased with his side’s defensive effort in keeping the Drua to just three points. \"Always nice when the other team doesn’t score a try, but just looking as the game was unfolding and that, there was a couple of handling errors and that from them, they made a few line breaks\", Dillon said. \"The bounce of the ball was definitely on our side.\" The Highlanders scored some sparkling tries through their back three as well as a late intercept to replacement No 8 Nikora Broughton. \"[Assistant coaches] Kenny Lynn and Tom Donnelly work pretty close on that side of the ball, so it was good to see some of their work that they’d strategically plotted to come to fruition.\" Winger Jona Nareki was a cut above in his first game back after nursing a hamstring complaint and bagged two tries for his side. \"He’s had some bad luck with injury Choc\", Dillon said. \"He has real value on and off the field. To get him back on and see what he can do, I thought he was class.\" Right winger Timoci Tavatavanawai was also sublime and helped himself to a blockbusting try. But his work over the ball and coming up with jackal turnovers might be his greatest weapon. \"As a defensive coach, to have a winger that has that awareness and strength over the ball it’s almost like a super power\", Dillon said. The Highlanders head to Wellington this weekend to play the Hurricanes, who will be buoyed by their 20-17 win against the Chiefs in their final round-robin game. The Highlanders will need to ramp things up after they were well beaten 47-12 when they played the Hurricanes back in round six. \"We’ve got to continue to build. Obviously they’re up around the top of the table for a reason. \"This season we played them down here and it was probably one of our poorest performances. We’re looking forward to getting up there and rolling up our sleeves and getting into it.\"",

        "content": "Kate Heffernan (left) drives on to the ball from her sister, Georgia, during the Southern Steel’s game against the Northern Mystics in Dunedin on Sunday. PHOTOS: MICHAEL BRADLEY PHOTOGRAPHY Rightly so — the Southern Steel coach had just led her team to their first victory against the Northern Mystics since April 17, 2022. They did it in emphatic fashion with a 47-43 victory over the ANZ Premiership defending champions at the Edgar Centre on Sunday to win the Georgina Salter Memorial Trophy. \"I actually feel amazing,\" Bloxham told the Otago Daily Times after the game. \"There’s been times where we let ourselves down, but ... I really felt like we took control of that game right from the start. \"I feel immensely proud of us being able to bring the trophy back here and hold on to it.\" Defensively, it was the best performance of the season for the Steel who recorded 14 gains, 12 deflections, seven intercepts and three defensive rebounds. Then there is the collective effort they showed to grind the Mystics into mistakes that do not show up on the statistics sheet. \"I’m super proud of the defensive effort that we put out there. \"It just gives them confidence in some of the things that we’ve been talking about. \"The girls really did their homework really well this week and we were really specific about what we wanted to target. \"I think that’s really pleasing as a coach when you can see that out there in real time ... and them pulling it off.\" Southern Steel coach Reinga Bloxham. A dreaded injury curse remains with the Steel after Shannon Saunders was ruled out for the season and replacement wing attack Ivari Christie was ruled out of Sunday’s game with a knee complaint. Bloxham called up Serina Daunakamakama, who is a Mystics training partner and plays for New Zealand under-21, and after only being at two trainings, and a captain’s run, she was impressive at wing attack. She caught the eye of Bloxham, who said Daunakamakama did an \"amazing job\", as did the other attackers \"You can’t underestimate somebody like Georgia and Kate Heffernan, and even Grace [Namana],\" Bloxham said. \"They really did their job so well that [Daunakamakama] could just focus on what she needed to do.\" Bloxham spoke during the week about other players needing to step up into senior roles without the calm presence of Saunders, and Bloxham was pleased to see the rise of Georgia Heffernan. \"Georgia works really hard and she does a power of work for us, but I think ... as the game went out, you could really see her really settle into her job and really understand that she was going to have to lead down there. \"That’s great for us going forward if she can continue to do that.\" The Steel will need to build from that performance when they face the Central Pulse, who will be hurting after their first loss at the weekend, in Invercargill on Saturday. kayla.hodge@odt.co.nz",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” RELATED: Former B.C. premier Horgan helps sell Canadian hydrogen in Germany RELATED: B.C. eyes green hydrogen economy with cross-country partnership RELATED: Opposition worried gov is pressuring hydrogen company over PG proposal RELATED: Canada’s first renewable diesel and hydrogen complex to open in Prince George Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. RELATED: Infrastructure bank lends $75M to BC Ferries for zero-emission vessels Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.”",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "WASHINGTON: Josef Newgarden of Team Penske denied a late challenge from Mexican Pato O’Ward to win a thrilling and incident packed Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, becoming the first back-to-back winner in 22 years. New Zealand’s Scott Dixon finished third in the race which had been delayed by four hours due to heavy rain and lightning in the area. The crowd were rewarded for their patience during the storm delay with a dramatic finale to the race. O’Ward, whose best finish in the race was runner-up in 2022, looked to have timed his push perfectly, grabbing the lead in turn one on the final lap. But Newgarden powered back to pass him going into turn three and claim a record-extending 20th victory in the Indy 500 for Penske. Newgarden finished 0.341 ahead of Arrow McLaren’s O’Ward and celebrated by jumping into the crowd. “There is no better way to win a race than that. I’ve got to give it up to Pato as well,” Newgarden told race broadcasters NBC. “He’s an incredibly clean driver. He could have easily won this race, too, but it just fell our way and I am so proud of everybody, proud of the whole team,” he said. The last driver to win back-to-back in the fabled race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was Brazilian Helio Castroneves, who triumphed in 2001 and 2002. So close O’Ward was distraught after again getting so close to the prize he has sought for so long. “It’s hard to put it in words. I’m proud of the work that we did today. We recovered. we went back, we went forward, we went back,” he said. “Some people were just driving like maniacs. We had so many near race enders and just so close again, so close,” he said. “I put that car through things I never thought he was going to be able to do. Oh man, it’s just so painful when you put so much into it and then two laps short, or two corners short,” he added. Alexander Rossi of Arrow McLaren, had jousted with Newgarden for the lead but finished fourth with Spaniard Alex Palou of Chip Ganassi Racing in fifth. Penske’s Scott McLaughlin, who started on pole, finished sixth. The lead changed 87-times over the 500 miles with 16 different race leaders. The opening lap was a chaotic one when British rookie Tom Blomqvist caused a crash on the opening lap that collected 2022 winner Marcus Ericsson of Sweden and Brazilian Pietro Fittipaldi. Blomqvist lost control after touching the curbing and span across the track colliding with Andretti Global’s Ericsson. “I can’t believe it,” said Ericsson after completing a medical check. “It’s unbelievable. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know what to say. We had to work so hard. We fought all last weekend. We fought all week and this happens,” he said. Penske redemption Marco Andretti failed to finish after his car made wall contact as he was approaching O’Ward on turn one of lap 114 after a restart following a yellow flag. “I don’t really trust half the guys I’m around, but you’ve just got to go for it and whatever happens, happens,” said Andretti. The victory for Newgarden was a sweet moment for Penske who have endured criticism and sanctions after a cheating scandal. Team president Tim Cindric, race engineer Luke Mason and two others were suspended for two races including the Indy 500. The suspension came after IndyCar uncovered a set-up on three Penske cars at Long Beach last month allowing drivers to utilize a “push-to-pass” button on starts and restarts in violation of series rules. Newgarden was stripped of his win in St. Petersburg, Florida, in the season opener and he didn’t miss the chance to respond to the critics. “They can say whatever they want at this point, I don’t care anymore,” said the Tennessean. “I’m just so proud of the team, they crushed it. They came in with the fastest cars and we’ve worked our tails off,” he added. “Luke, Tim, they are not here today but they are a huge part of this,” he added. — AFP",

        "content": "Readers searching for treasures at The Star Regent 24 Hour Book sale. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Angela Trolove will take what she can get of Italian literature in Ōtepoti Dunedin. A few years ago, I would travel from Tainui each week to bring my son to Opoho playcentre, a place I really liked. There I met a mother who grew up in Brighton. She was pleased her childhood friends were just neighbours, she said. You couldn’t choose your subculture in the back of beyond. It was your neighbours or no-one. I admire that. In this way, and this is the real point of this article, while in German or French you’re spoilt for choice, second-hand Italian books in Ōtepoti Dunedin are finite. When I do luck in at the Regent book sale, I can count on one hand my donor’s interests: mathematical theory and, for children, Richard Scarry. So I pay my gold coin to the voluntary cashier and take home a book on Infinity. A little light evening reading. A modest collection of novels at the public library veers more towards literature. This collection was donated by my Italian teacher who convenes the community’s La Piccola Italia. In it, there are some excellent short stories by the good-hearted yet precise Antonio Tabbuchi and formal, humane Primo Levi. But looking for novelty, I tip the spine down on a thick Mondadori paperback. I’ll take what I can get. All this to say I’m working my way through a novel outside my genre by an author I don’t warm to and this in my expensive downtime. I put him down. I pick him up. Fabio Volo’s novel Un Posto Nel Mondo boldly bores where no book has bored before. Three paragraphs indulge narrator Michele debating how to word a first text to love interest Francesca. As Michele’s insecurity accrues, I blurt aloud \"Are you joking?\" I check through the novel for an editor to whom I can say, \"Mud be on your name\", but there is none. Harsh criticism on my part. While there are dull tracts in this popular fiction novel (often a feeling of word-count-for-the-sake-of-word-count surfaces), I snuggle into any writer, in this case TV presenter Fabio Volo, diligently writing a book. Even when that book includes a blow-by-blow of frustrations and mental prattle as narrator Michele agonises for Francesca to message him back. Diligence. Good. Does criticism also exist to stop writers abusing readers? But, snarls the devil, you can put the book down at any time. I am not his readership. A lot of toilet talk. I search online for reviews for the book. The first-up glow. One allows, of Volo’s novels perhaps this is the lesser work. I am allowed to read the book, I tell myself. It was in bookstores in 2006 and reprinted three times by 2010, according to my copy. It’s there on the library shelf, but I also feel like I’m not allowed to read it because Volo is not my people. If I grew up in Brighton, he would be my people by necessity. I read on to maintain my language so I can be with my children in their father’s Lombardy when we return there. I love the Italian language. With Tabucchi I look up the high words. With Volo I could look up the slang but I won’t need them to fit in with the people I want to. Call me a snob. And yet he is coherent and diligent as a writer, and he loves peeing standing, and loving women. I tautoko that. I recognise and celebrate that. His chapter breaks make sense. Credit where credit is due. He knows how to saddle up the horse-and-trap of a novel and flap the reins and make it go. On the plus side, here’s what popular fiction does — \"not all popular fiction\" — allowing clichés, it dares me to lighten up. Popular fiction gives me a sense of humour. It releases me from perfectionism. In an often wealthy country like Aotearoa New Zealand, it’s an anomaly, almost delectable, being limited for choice. The books available to me have this curious denominator of readers of Italian who spent time in my city. My Italian canon is at the mercy of their tastes. I could read e-books. I could ask my mother-in-law (a connoisseur of literature) to post me winners of the Premio Strega. I listen to podcasts and audio books on RAI (Radio Italia). But I enjoy in autumn attending the annual Regent book sale. This year, I stock up on the three Italian volumes to get me through a long, cold winter. Like a Belgian writer friend once told me, our happiness is out of our hands. We’re granted finite happiness in life and it comes to us when it comes. It’s not something we determine. And I brightened. My Italian literary input is like that. — Angela Trolove is a poet who teaches creative writing at the University of Otago.",

        "content": "Philippa Laufiso, of Dunedin, with Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, after being presented with the MNZM for services to arts and the community earlier this month. PHOTO: GOVERNMENT HOUSE Ahead of next week’s King’s Birthday honours list, Cabinet minister Louise Upston writes about the importance of recognising people. It was 140 years ago that New Zealand honoured its first woman, Miss Annie Alice Crisp, Lady Superintendent of Auckland Hospital, with the Royal Red Cross on April 19, 1884. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross in a ceremony at Government House in Auckland, attended by more than 600 people. Established the previous year by Queen Victoria to recognise \"special devotion and competency ... in their nursing duties with our Army in the field, or in our naval and military hospitals\", the decoration was conferred exclusively on women until 1976. Crisp had served with distinction in the Zulu and Anglo-Egyptian Wars and been awarded the Egyptian medal and the Khedive’s Star. Annie was clearly an exceptional woman. Since then, we have seen more and more women be nominated for their unwavering contribution to their communities. However, I believe there are more hidden gems out there waiting to be recognised for their commitment to the country. Nominations for the New Year Honours list should be submitted to the Honours Unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet before mid-June. As acting Minister for Women, and Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, I am always in awe learning about the incredible people that serve New Zealand. We have an abundance of talent, work ethic and compassion that makes our country great, and the honours system is a fantastic opportunity to bring this to light. Twice a year honours lists celebrating extraordinary New Zealanders and their achievements are announced, and in the last five years we have seen women recipients account for around half of those lists. It’s a nod to the key role women play across our communities and in the fabric of our society. As our honours system has evolved, what we have seen in recent years is a real increase in the recognition of people doing extraordinary things across our local community, charity, and voluntary sectors. About 800 to 1000 nominations are considered each year, and it is a great opportunity to celebrate all the wonderful New Zealanders from all over the country who are serving their communities and achieving something special. Without nominations received from the public, many of our backroom heroes — the people who go into their communities, get involved with organisations and charities, and give back to other people — wouldn’t be celebrated in the way they deserve. This year’s list of New Year Honours recipients, for example, recognised 74 women out of 151 recipients. In addition to highlighting the work of women in services to sport, education, the arts, health, and business, it also highlighted the work some women have done supporting other women, including in governance, helping survivors of domestic violence, and addressing the gender pay gap. We probably all know someone who has been exceptional and made a positive impact in their community. Let’s shine some light their way and celebrate them. By increasing the number of individuals nominated for these awards, not only do we recognise their efforts, but we can also improve the diversity of the awards, particularly when it comes to gender representation, and ensure that they reflect New Zealand communities. — Louise Upston is the Minister of Community and Voluntary Sector, Disability Issues, Social Development and Child Poverty Reduction.",

        "content": "Ploughing-in rushes with a motor tractor. — Otago Witness, 27.5.1924 Mr G. Holford BAg gave an interesting address on farm tractors. He stated that one of the most striking features in connection with arable farming in the dominion was undoubtedly the demand for farm tractors. An investigation had shown that circumstances had arisen which made farmers turn their attention to tractors for farm work. It had to be said that the tractor would never really displace all the horses on a farm. There were certain tasks that were more suitable to the horse, and for this reason the retention of a number of them was considered essential. The speaker gave reasons why the tractor was bound eventually to take the place of the horse in heavy farm work. A tractor worked in any weather. A horse was subject to ills of the flesh, and the tractor was machinery which any man of average intelligence and ability could fix in a short time. The expenses for horses went on the whole time, whereas when the switch was turned off on the tractor it was finished with until again required. Tractors enabled the farmer to work a large area of land in a short time, and so he could take advantage of the limited period when the soil had to be used to the best advantage. The speaker quoted the relative cost of the tractor and a two-horse team for one year’s working. It had been proved that a two-horse team cost £1000 to work for one year, while on the other hand it cost only £600 to work the tractor. Columnist moved by messages In Memoriam verses are not always conceived in the most felicitous taste, though they are pathetically well-intentioned, and therefore exempt from criticism. An unhappy example one would never think of quoting, but I was struck by the juxtaposition of two maternal notices of last Saturday ( ODT , May 24, 1924): \"Moe mai E Mama, Ito moenga roa, I runga Moeraki, Moke moke ai. Mate Ariki Koe manaki ai, Moe mai E Mama, Ito moenga roa.\" \"The noblest thoughts my soul can claim, The holiest words my tongue can frame, Unworthy are to praise the name, More sacred than all other. An infant, when her first love came, A man, to find it just the same; Reverently I breathe her name, The blessed name of mother.\" — by ‘Wayfarer’ Rails extend inland A correspondent writing from Beaumont states that the Public Works Department is making good headway with the railway line. They are now within three miles of Miller’s Flat, but it will be some considerable time before the last touches are put on and the line opened. Window’s crash launches apples The truth of the old adage \"It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good\" was borne out on Monday evening, when a large front window in the premises of Mr A. Geddes, fruiterer, Princes street, fell outwards, and the fine display of Delicious apples which the window contained was precipitated upon the footpath. Small boys and also a number of their elders \"made hay while the sun shone\" and about 12 or 14 cases of apples wore promptly collected by the onlookers. The window was valued at approximately £25 and was covered by insurance. It is surmised that the heavy wind, combined with the weight of the apples, caused the window to collapse. — ODT , 28.5.1924 ( Compiled by Peter Dowden )",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "A woman stabbed to death on a beach in the seaside town of Bournemouth has been named locally as Amie Gray, a sports coach who has been described as a beloved mother, wife and friend. A 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of her murder has been released without charge, Dorset police have said, adding that they were stepping up their hunt for the killer. On Monday they released CCTV images of a suspect and warned members of the public not to approach him. Officers combed the beach and the surrounding areas as holidaymakers sunbathed nearby. Family and friends paid tribute to Gray, 34, from Poole, who was the women’s head coach at Dorset futsal club. Some scattered petals on to the sea at Durley Chine beach as the sun went down on Sunday and posted on social media: “Sunsets will always remind us of you, Amie Gray. Forever loved wife and mother.” Gray and a second woman, 38, were stabbed at 11.45pm on Friday. The second woman was seriously injured and is still being treated in hospital. Police renewed their appeal to identify the suspect from CCTV images. The force said: “A 17-year-old boy from Lancashire was arrested on suspicion of murder. Following inquiries over the weekend, he has now been released without charge and eliminated from inquiries.” Det Supt Richard Dixey, of the major crime investigation team, said: “The investigation into this tragic incident is progressing and detectives are dedicated to finding out what happened and ensuring our communities remain safe and secure. “We need the public’s help to identify the suspect in the CCTV images. If you recognise him or have any information, no matter how small, that may lead us to his identity, please get in touch immediately. We would ask the public not to approach a suspect under any circumstances, but to call 999 immediately. “Officers and staff from across the force are out in the town conducting extensive inquiries, including house-to-house visits, so the public will see a very overt and planned police presence in and around the Bournemouth area. “We do not take lightly the impact this tragic incident will have on our communities and many members of the public will be concerned. There remains an enhanced and visible policing presence in the area with officers who can be approached if the public feel in any way concerned.” A friend of Gray posted on social media: “She was always the kindest lovely young girl and continued to be so throughout her cruelly cut short life.” Another said: “Fly high, Amie Gray, I’ll miss you so much. I feel so heavy! You were such a good friend and someone I could call about anything. A beautiful person inside and out. Thank you for all the laughs and memories I will cherish for ever.” A third added: “You lit up the room with your fun and bubbly presence.” Floral tributes have been left at both ends of the mile-long cordon. Officers with metal detectors and sniffer dogs have been seen combing the beach and clambering up the cliffs. Dorset futsal club posted on its Facebook page: “The club has received some truly devastating news. We cannot put this into words at this time and as a mark of respect to all those affected, we will not be posting anything new for the foreseeable future.” Residents spoke of their concerns at the incident and at crime in general in the area. One, who did not want to be named, said: “There’s definitely been a noticeable increase in antisocial behaviour and crime in Bournemouth in the last few years. It’s alarming.” A couple who rent a beach hut and wanted to remain anonymous said: “We are definitely worried by this incident, but we wouldn’t walk around the beach late at night anyway.”",

According to the financial results, taken on record in the Board of Directors meeting held on Monday, NALCO has posted a net profit at Rs 2060 crore, registering a robust increase of 34 percent year-on-year (YoY). Beating market expectations, the company has also recorded an impressive revenue from operations at Rs.13149 crore for the FY24. The net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 2024 registered multi-fold increase at Rs 1016 crore against Rs.522 crore which is about 95percent higher as compared to the year-ago period. Worth mentioning that despite weak prices of metals, market volatility and geopolitical crosswinds, NALCO has been able to register considerable growth in several fronts and in profit margins in FY24. The Company has been able to continue its growth trajectory supported by robust growth across all its business units. In FY24, the company achieved highest-ever bauxite excavation of 76,00,230 metric tonnes, highest-ever Cast Metal production of 4,63,428 metric tonnes, highest-ever metal sale of 4,70,108 metric tonnes and production of 2 million tonnes of coal in the very first year of operationalization of its Coal Mines. Appreciating the performance of the Company, Sridhar Patra, CMD, NALCO, said that the company’s growth accelerated in Q4 of FY23-24 and the same is reflected in strong performance and considerable revenue growth. Attributing the success to the commitment and support of employees and various stakeholders, Patra further pinned hope that with further firming up of the aluminium prices and increase in aluminium demand, NALCO is all set to continue the growth story in future.",

        "content": "Exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa trade exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration,” says Zoryana Slater. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options. Participation in FAB West Africa presents a prime opportunity to elevate the visibility and reputation of Linc Drinks in the African market.”",

        "content": "update 10:10 AM PT -- Jake Paul is shutting down any online chatter about their fight being called off in the wake of Mike's health scare. Jake says people \"love to make s**t up,\" but reassured fans the July 20 bout is still a go. As he put it, \"nothing changed.\" Mike Tyson is recovering from an ulcer flare-up he suffered while flying cross-country -- and it was so bad, airline staff had to put out the call for any medical professionals on the plane to come forward. Tyson was flying from Miami to L.A. on Saturday when he started feeling sick. The American Airlines flight was almost at LAX, but the boxer was in so much pain, flight attendants asked if there was anyone onboard to help him. Mike's rep tells TMZ ... \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Paramedics boarded the plane when it reached the gate at LAX, and they treated Tyson on the spot ... according to In Touch Weekly , which first reported the incident. Tyson's rep says he's doing \"great\" now. Most of the passengers were reportedly unaware it was Mike who suffered the medical emergency ... they just knew someone was in distress, because the call for a doctor or nurse popped up on all the in-seat screens, before it was announced over the PA. There was a reported 2-hour delay in the flight taking off, but that had nothing to do with Tyson -- who felt fine at that point. His rep says that was a mechanical issue with the plane. Passengers did have to wait about 25 minutes to get off the plane due to the paramedics checking out MT. 57-year-old Tyson is in the middle of training for his July boxing match against Jake Paul .",

        "content": "Petrit Alijaj, 23, jumped in front of his fiancée Saturday while riding a New York City subway, protecting her from a man who allegedly tossed flaming liquid, the New York Post reported. Alijaj was sitting on the No. 1 train Saturday afternoon with his fiancée and cousin as they hoped to head to the Statue of Liberty, to the outlet. When the train pulled into a lower Manhattan station, however, the suspect, identified as Nile Taylor, was allegedly holding a cup in his hand which contained a flaming liquid, according to the outlet. “He had a cup,” Alijaj told the outlet, describing the insides of what Taylor had “like oil, he made fire and he threw it all.” A 23-year-old man named Petrit Alijaj, who comes from Albania, was badly burned in a subway attack in New York City. He bravely jumped in front of his fiancée to protect her from a man who threw a flaming liquid at them. Toxic Masculinity for the win! The incident happened... — Old School Eddie (@Old_SchoolEddie) As Taylor allegedly tossed the liquid towards Alijaj’s fiancée and cousin, Alijaj was able to turn his body to shield the two, the outlet reported. Alijaj’s shirt immediately caught on fire, prompting him to flee the train and attempt to put out the fire by slapping himself, according to the outlet. Following the arrival of first responders, Alijaj was photographed without a shirt, his upper torso and face appearing to be a bright pink, according to the outlet. New York Fire Department (FDNY) showered Alijaj’s burns with water, according to the New York Post. Alijaj was not initially concerned with their severity but changed his mind after being taken to New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Hospital and realizing he was covered in blisters, the outlet reported. Doctors later revealed to Alijaj that 30% of his body “was burnt” as he suffered from burns on his “neck, ears, chest, arms and left hand,” according to the New York Post. Following the incident Taylor allegedly attempted to flee the scene, only to be apprehended shortly thereafter by police who tracked a cellphone he had picked up on the train, the New York Post reported. The incident is the second time in four months in which someone tossed flaming liquid onto a passenger, the outlet reported. In early March 2024, following a surge in crimes on the public transportation, Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul her plan of bolstering the city’s subways with 750 National Guard troops and 250 state troopers in order to allow passengers to feel safer. Since the announcement, however, crime continues on the trains, with one of the more deadly incidents resulting in a 36-year-old being shot during an altercation with another male in mid-March 2024.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal's return to the French Open - and possible farewell - is over as the 14-time champion loses to German fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the French Open singles for only the fourth time in 116 matches Nadal has become synonymous with Roland Garros but, in front of a partisan crowd baying for a Spanish victory, the 37-year-old could not replicate the level which has made him almost unbeatable on the Paris clay. The 22-time Grand Slam winner was beaten 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 by the in-form Zverev. Nadal indicated when he missed last year's French Open that the 2024 season could be his final one on tour because of injury. However, he cannot now be \"100%\" certain he will not continue, but does concede it is a \"good chance\" this will be his final French Open. Nadal arrived on Court Philippe Chatrier - the scene of many of the finest moments of his career - to a thunderous reception from a packed stadium. While nowhere near his scintillating best, the former world number one showed flashes of the brilliance that has made him so loved. But it was not enough to stringently test the 27-year-old Zverev, who played with a measure of control throughout. It was only Nadal's fourth defeat in 116 singles matches at Roland Garros and Zverev became the third man - after Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021 - to beat him there. \"I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you, if it is I have enjoyed it,\" Nadal said in an on-court speech. \"The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\" With some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the Parisian crowd showed their appreciation for the clay-court Grand Slam's finest champion. Anticipation for Nadal's return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion – easily identified through Spanish red and yellow flags and 'Gracias Rafa' T-shirts – milling around the arena from as soon as the gates opened. As recently as last month, after a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete at the place which he has dominated. In a bullish pre-tournament news conference on Saturday, Nadal said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\". Practice is very different to a match, of course. Nadal knew that and knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev. With the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made last week. Zverev is considered one of the finest not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-court player, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam-winning champions over the next fortnight. He reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up for Roland Garros by winning the Rome title earlier this month. Zverev insists a court case over domestic abuse allegations, which will start in Berlin later this week, will not distract him from the task of becoming a major champion. The way in which he played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites. An ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing. Each mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control in dominant service games before breaking again for the set. That considerably flattened the previously buoyant mood. Nadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hope again by moving into a 4-2 lead in the second set. But as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away. The Olympic champion remained calm and composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking which Nadal could not cope with. The gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal's great rival Djokovic – along with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men's champion Carlos Alcaraz – appearing in the stands to watch. Like the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front. Nadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev continued to trust his shots and came through in a strong finish. \"The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,\" said Nadal. \"But it was not enough against a great player.\"",

        "content": "Two years ago, Rafael Nadal won his 14th French Open and was on top of the world. Now, his dominant career at the clay Slam might be over. In 2022, Nadal begin the year with titles at the Australian Open and French Open . He was looking strong in Wimbledon, too, possibly ready to supplant Novak Djokovic as the top player in the world. Then, disaster struck. In the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, Nadal suffered an abdominal tear that kept him out of action for six weeks. He was not quite the same early in the year, but still played somewhat well. Early 2023 was when things took a turn for the worse. He suffered a hip injury in the Australian Open second round, which kept him out of the sport for nearly a year. During his recovery, he announced that 2024 would “likely” be his final year on Tour . He returned this year, in fits and starts, and clearly has not physically been the same as before the injury. Which brings us to this year’s French Open, on the courts that Nadal has owned for almost two full decades now. What could the Spaniard do in possibly his final stint at the event? To start, Nadal was given a brutal draw . Unseeded due to his absence from basically all of 2023, Nadal could have been drawn to face anyone in the tournament. He was slated to face Alexander Zverev, one of the pre-tournament favorites . Zverev is coming off an impressive title in the Rome Masters, and has looked very strong on clay this year. Nadal, meanwhile, had basically no match practice coming into the event. For facing the #4 seed and a pre-tournament favorite, Nadal acquitted himself very well. After a slow start, the Spaniard earned early breaks in both the second and third sets. He made Zverev work, hard, for well over three hours, but in the end Nadal just did not have the consistency every single point to take out one of the top players in the world. The match ended with a very respectable 36 67(5) 36 scoreline in favor of the German, but it was far closer than that implies. Was this Nadal’s final match in Paris? Almost certainly not. The Olympic Games will be held on the French Open courts this summer, and Nadal plans to compete. If he can’t earn a spot in the singles draw, he will likely be able to compete in doubles, together with World #2 Carlos Alcaraz. But is Nadal done at the French Open? Quite possibly.

She constantly frets about their health, especially now that they’re both in their formative years. “I always worry that they might get sick so we try our best to avoid any illness,” Marian said. “In school, they might catch a cold from their classmates, so I talk to them about how they can protect themselves.” She makes sure that they eat well and that their diet includes an assortment of vegetables. She also sees to it that they take their vitamins, explaining to them why they need to do so. “Of course, I’m not a perfect parent, but my husband and I do our best to raise our children well,” Marian said. When it comes to exercise and playing outdoors, she is all for it—provided it’s not too hot. “My son loves to play basketball and other games, but it really depends on the weather. If they want to play outside, they have to be mindful of the time; around 4 or 5 p.m. is best. Rivera (second from left) with husband Dingdong Dantes and their children, Sixto and Zia —MARIAN RIVERA/INSTAGRAM “If it’s raining or too sunny, we stay indoors and do arts and crafts. I join in the activity so all three of us end up learning something new,” Marian said. The actress and celebrity endorser was the featured guest at the 50th anniversary celebration of Ceelin, a vitamin supplement from pharmaceutical company Unilab “My family, especially my kids, are my number one priority. Minsan lang sila maging bata kaya I promised to be the kind of mom who shows up and supports them in all that they want to do and achieve,” Marian said. “To working moms like me, alam ko hindi madali to manage your time for work and for your family pero magagawan at magagawan ito ng paraan. Sigurado din ako na it will all be worth it.” To mark its 50th anniversary, Ceelin launched its latest ad campaign with the song “Nais Ko,” that was written by National Artist Ryan Cayabyab and popularized by Basil Valdez. At the press launch held last week, the Mandaluyong Children’s Choir performed the song for an audience that included other celebrity moms like Andi Manzano and Bianca Gonzalez. The two later joined Marian onstage for an informal panel discussion. “Through the years, it has always been our mission to help Filipino children have strong immunity, as we believe this is the key to enriching their lives,” said Ceelin brand manager Rachel Mistal.

        "description": "Environmental Protection Department says it will start to arrange for retailers to return all unsold stock because of suspension of waste-charging scheme.",
        "content": "Hong Kong authorities have been left with 170 million garbage bags bought for HK$74 million (US$9.5 million) for a now-shelved waste-charging scheme, the government has said, after granting tenders totalling HK$1.15 billion last year for production. The Environmental Protection Department on Monday said it had cost about HK$74 million to produce the bags, and that it would start to arrange for retailers to return all unsold stock because of the suspension. The cost of bag production was on top of the HK$177 million the government spent over the previous three financial years on the scheme, including HK$30 million allocated to publicity work. The announcement prompted lawmaker Doreen Kong Yuk-foon to ask whether the suspension would constitute a breach of the contracts signed with the manufacturers and if any compensation would be involved. “Every bag costs. Residents have to pay for them,” she said. “Will the government consider selling the bags at cost price? Can this help with the losses, at least a little?” Under the scheme, people would have to buy government-approved bags available in nine sizes, priced from 30 HK cents (3 US cents) to HK$11. A special label priced at HK$11 would be available for large or oddly shaped items. Environmental authorities last year granted nine tenders totalling HK$1.15 billion to four plastic bag producers, according to Government Logistics Department documents. Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Monday there was no agreement with the manufacturers regarding the minimum quantity of bags produced. “We will follow the terms of the respective contracts and discuss the matter with the manufacturers of the bags,” he said. “As for selling the bags, we feel that we may first [concentrate] on publicity and education. “If we start to, say, sell the bags, it may cause emotions and misunderstanding among the public. I find it not appropriate.” He said the government planned to hand out 20 bags for free to every household in public rental flats each month for half a year starting in June. By providing each of the 840,000 households with bags, the government would have given out 100.8 million after six months, leaving 69.2 million in stock. The government said private residential buildings could also receive free bags if they signed a charter promising to provide recycling facilities and handle the recyclables properly. It would also distribute bags in educational activities. After the panel meeting, Tse said there would continue to be demand for designated bags for educational purposes. “Our agreement did not specify how many bags must be produced, so if there are changes in the quantity of bags needed, we can simply discuss with the manufacturers accordingly.” One of the four manufacturers revealed to local media that its contract stipulated that authorities had the right to “speed up or stop” production, and that their budget, manpower and production lines would be affected by the suspension. Another supplier said he did not expect production to resume in the foreseeable future, and that it would need to seek legal advice and discuss with authorities how to deal with the situation. The Environmental Protection Department last month said advertising materials for the scheme had been broadcast on television and radio about 4,000 times, and on more than 9,000 display monitors at public transport stations and vehicles. It also displayed about 4,000 promotional banners and posters on roadsides, government facilities and public housing estates and placed advertisements on about 100 mobile applications and websites. The department earlier said the government had earmarked HK$581 million for the current 2024-25 financial year for the scheme, involving 72 government headcounts. Edwin Lau Che-feng, founder and executive director of The Green Earth environmental group, said the scheme could not be suspended indefinitely and suggested the government launch a trial on its own premises to set an example. “There are business circles and residents in society who still have so many doubts about this,” he said. “All government department offices, government-managed premises and government civil servants’ dormitories should do it themselves. “This can set a good example for all Hong Kong residents.”",

        "content": "In this photo released by the Taiwan Presidential Office, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, right, puts on a cowboy hat given by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, during a Monday meeting in Taipei, Taiwan. A U.S. congressional delegation met Taiwan's new leader on Monday in a show of support shortly after China held drills around the self-governing island in response to his inauguration speech. AP/Taiwan Presidential Office via AP hide caption TAIPEI, Taiwan — A U.S. congressional delegation met Taiwan's new leader on Monday in a show of support days after China held drills around the self-governing island in response to his inauguration. Rep. Andy Barr, the co-chair of the Taiwan caucus in the U.S. Congress, said the United States is fully committed to supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically. \"There should be no doubt, there should be no skepticism in the United States, Taiwan or anywhere in the world, of American resolve to maintain the status quo and peace in the Taiwan Strait,\" the Republican from Kentucky said at a news conference in the capital, Taipei, after the delegation met Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary. The U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The Chinese government expressed strong opposition to the congressional visit, saying it undermined China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, referring to the waterway between China and Taiwan. The lawmakers' five-day visit \"ran against the political commitment of the U.S. government to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan, sending a seriously wrong signal to the separatist force of Taiwan independence,\" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing. Lai, who took office one week ago, is expected to continue the policies of Tsai Ing-wen, his predecessor from the same Democratic Progressive Party. The new foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, noted the recent Chinese drills and called the American delegation's visit \"an important gesture of solidarity\" at a critical time. The delegation included four Republicans and two Democrats and was led by Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Last year, China sanctioned the Texas Republican after he visited Taiwan in April. \"America is and always will be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the Congress to Taiwan,\" he said. McCaul cited congressional approval last month of a military aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. China firmly opposes the U.S. arming Taiwan, Mao said. The other delegation members were Republicans Young Kim from California and Joe Wilson from South Carolina and Democrats Jimmy Panetta from California and Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania.",

        "content": "In the midst of an ongoing heatwave, temperatures in Sindh, in southern Pakistan, surpassed 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit), marking the highest reading of the summer and nearly reaching the record high for the nation, the met office reported on Monday. A group of international scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is most likely to blame for the extreme temperatures that have occurred in Asia over the past month. According to a senior Pakistan Meteorological Department official, Shahid Abbas, temperatures in Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for ancient monuments that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization, which was founded in 2500 BC, had risen as high as 52.2 C (126 F) in the past 24 hours. The temperature reached the town’s and the nation’s record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F), respectively. It is the hottest reading of the summer thus far. Though Mohenjo Daro is a small town with hot summers, moderate winters, and little rainfall, its few markets—which include bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, shops that repair electronics, and vendors of fruits and vegetables—are always crowded with people. “The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,” Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. “I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.” Close to Ali’s shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop’s shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. “Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves. The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department. The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan’s largest city.",

And this can increase the value of our exports by perhaps 10 times,\" Go said during the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay City on Monday.A report from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) showed that the country's metallic mineral production value sustained growth and rose by 4.79 percent in 2023.In the latest report released by DENR's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB), the value of domestic metallic mineral production increased to P249.05 billion from the P237.66 billion logged in 2022 due to the outstanding performance of gold and nickel.Currently, the country's nickel ore is being exported to China, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, with China getting 98 percent of the total or 17.6 million dry metric tons in 2023.Go also emphasized the need to complete the country's geo mapping of critical mineral resources, led by the DENR, which he said would also help attract investments into the mining sector.Earlier this month, the government said it was planning to cut the processing time of mining permits from six years to one to three years via digitalization.Moreover, Go said that he was optimistic on fostering the development of the mineral industry, which in turn would create an industry for electric vehicles.\"Processing electric vehicles in the Philippines would be our end goal, at least for today, that should be our end goal,\" he said.",

And the 14-time winner here must now decide if this was his last match here. Fellow superstars Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek along with Manchester City ’s Rodri packed into the main Court Philippe-Chatrier for the biggest match-up of the first round. But just like Andy Murray on the same court on Sunday night , the King of Clay could not turn back the clock and find his old form with any consistency after two years dogged by hip injuries. Related articles Rafael Nadal at serious risk of early French Open exit after fiery umpire row Andy Murray makes sad admission after disappointing French Open exit The Spaniard has been close to unbeatable here since winning his first French Open title as a teenager in 2005.

After the defeat, Nadal said: “I would love to thank you all it’s difficult for me to talk I don’t know if it’ll be the last time I’m going to be here in front of you, I don’t know if it is the last time, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt. \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn’t the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player. For me it’s tough to say what’s going on in the future. \"There’s a bg percentage I won’t be back here, but I can’t say 100%. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something I don’t feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that’s motivation. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable – I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it’s been a beautiful process. Every year has been different and what it makes it seem so special are the people behind the scenes who have helped me. It’s been unforgettable. The feelings you have made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" All the attention was on Rafael Nadal on day two of the French Open (Image: Getty) The 22-time Grand Slam champion served for the second set at 5-4 after a hot streak but was broken to love and lost the tiebreak and any realistic chance of a shock win. Nadal would have beaten most other players in this tournament yesterday but not the solid Zverev in his current form. The German, who is nearly 11 years younger, was quicker and stronger and confirmed his status as one of the favourites for the title. He served superbly and made 77% of first serves while showing no emotion despite cheers for his every mistake. And disciplined Zverev ruthlessly punished short balls like Nadal in his prime. Winning his first Grand Slam here would be a big image problem for men’s tennis with Zverev appealing allegations of assault against his former girlfriend in a Berlin court this week. There was no doubt who was the crowd favourite here. Nadal’s huge ovation for his walk on to the court was followed by a smattering of boos for the 2020 US Open runner-up. When the stadium MC then read out the years of all 14 of the Spaniard’s wins here, the crowd was whipped into a frenzy. But hopes for a fairytale shock win in only Nadal’s fifth event of the season did not last long. The world No.275 was broken to love in the opening service game and the biggest early cheers when Zverev served a double fault. He took 13 minutes to win his first game but Zverev took his third set point after 50 minutes when Nadal steered a forehand into the net. Don't miss...

When he held for 2-2, he jumped and punched the air in celebration. WIth chants of “Rafa, Rafa” ringing around the arena, took his first break point with a forehand drop shot to lead 3-2 - and spark the loudest cheers of the match after 75 minutes. He then held to win three games in a row to lead 4-2. But Nadal could not close out the set at 5-4 and his forehand found the net on the first of three break points. The 2022 semi-final here saw the match go to a second set tiebreak before Zverev fell and ruptured his ankle ligaments after three hours and 13 minutes. Nadal produced a magical forehand winner to bring the score in the tiebreak to 4-5 before a weak backhand service return into the net gave Zverev the second set after two hours. Nadal came for a final time to break to lead 2-0 in the third set with a trademark forehand running pass. But Zverev broke straight back after finding the corner of the court with a high backhand volley off the top of his racket. The Spaniard saved three break points in the fifth game but he was broken to trail 3-4 when Zverev passed him as he attempted to serve-and-volley on break point. The German saved two break points at 4-3 before taking his first match point when Nadal sprayed a forehand long for his sixth break of serve. A planned post-match ceremony to honour Nadal was cancelled on Sunday after the Spaniard claimed it is “a big, big chance” this is his final French Open but he said: “I don't want to close 100% the door.” Stay up-to-date with the latest Tennis news Join us on WhatsApp Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

        "content": "Article content A former high school quarterback from Sherwood Park has been sentenced to five years in prison for killing a senior couple while drunk driving. Justice Shaina Leonard passed the sentence Monday on Taylor Yaremchuk, 30, for driving his car into Jim and Annie Macdonald while twice the legal limit. Leonard expressed frustration about the prevalence of drunk driving despite a “decades long” public education campaign about the dangers of being impaired behind the wheel. “A strong message must be sent to denounce and deter such conduct,” she said. Yaremchuk killed the Macdonalds Aug. 14, 2022, after drinking at a Sherwood Park golf course. He drove his Kia Optima for nine kilometres on Highway 628, at one point veering “completely into oncoming traffic,” Leonard said. He struck the Macdonalds near the intersection of Range Road 231, where they were riding their motorcycle. Crown prosecutors asked Yaremchuk be sentenced to five years in prison, while the defence sought three to five. Yaremchuk — who was once starting quarterback for Bev Facey High School and the Edmonton Wildcats — has been in custody since his sentencing hearing April 19.

        "description": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that 18-year-olds would be made to do national service if the Tories win the next general election",
        "content": "A National Service programme has not run in Britain since the 1960s. But that could soon change. As the Tories propose bringing it back for 18-year-olds , we look at how it works in other countries. In the UK, compulsory national service required all physically fit British men, aged between 18 and 26, to serve in the armed forces. It offered several roles at home, such as clerical work, and abroad, including fighting on the frontline. Students and apprentices could defer until they had completed their education or training. National Service chaos as surprise Tory policy descends into farce The announcement has been widely mocked ( Image: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock) According to the World Population Review, 80 countries globally currently have some form of national service or conscription in place. In total, 66 counties have made military service mandatory. In Switzerland, 18 weeks of military service training is mandatory for all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 30, as well as yearly refresher courses. Those who object can take part in civilian service, which is longer, and focuses on social welfare, healthcare and environmental protection. In Sweden, all citizens must complete a military enlistment form after turning 18 and, if selected, enrol in basic military training. Conscription in Denmark is mandatory for all physically fit men over the age of 18. Only around 5,000 undergo basic training, but people remain eligible for further conscription until the age of 50. Top Tory fails to rule out fining parents if kids don't do National Service In Estonia, men aged 18-27 must partake in mandatory military or government national service. The duration is eight to 11 months, depending on a person's education and rank. Reservists must attend military training courses every five years. In 2015, the Lithuanian Armed Forces reintroduced compulsory military service for men aged 19-26. Conscripts must serve for a minimum of nine months. All men in Russia aged between 18 and 30 must complete twelve months of military service or join the ‘alternate civil service’ for 21 months in jobs such as nurses, cleaners, and postal workers. Conscription takes place twice a year during spring and autumn. Norway has technically had compulsory military service since 1907, with men and women aged between 19 and 44 (or 18 to 55 in times of war) ordered to complete nineteen months of service. But it is highly competitive in reality - in 2023, 9,840 people were accepted - just over a quarter. Citizens who aren’t medically fit, or are conscious objectors are exempt. All able-bodied men in South Korea must serve between 18 to 21 months in the armed forces by the time they are 28. The length varies per branch, with those in the Army or Marines serving 18 months, conscripts in the Navy or firefighting service serving 20 months, and any conscripts in the Air Force required to serve 21 months. Conscientious objectors struggle to gain employment and can be forced to carry out 36 months of service working in the prison system Most Israeli men and women must enrol in military service at 18. Men are expected to serve a minimum of 32 months and women a minimum of 24 months. What is National Service plan and will the Tories force your teenager to serve in the Army Celebs who have served Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot, 39, served two years of national service in the Israeli army as a combat fitness instructor. In Norway, Princess Ingrid Alexandra who is second in line to the throne, was conscripted in January this year. The 20-year-old is serving as an engineer. Tottenham forward Son Heung-min, 31, only had to do four weeks' service as a reward for helping South Korea win football gold at the 2018 Asian Games. Meanwhile, all the members of the K-pop group BTS - one of the world’s top-selling bands with millions of fans - are currently serving in South Korea's armed forces and plan to reunite in 2025. In 2020, the South Korean parliament passed a bill allowing the group to delay their compulsory military service until the age of 30. The eldest member, Jin, joined in December 2022, followed by J-Hope a few months later. Suga and RM, the group’s leader, joined near the end of December 2023, followed by Jimin and Jungkook. Currently, Suga is fulfilling his requirements as a social service agent, while the rest of the group is serving in the army.

        "content": "Oil prices saw a slight increase in subdued trading due to public holidays in Britain and the United States. This followed a week marked by concerns over U.S. interest rates amidst persistent inflation. The Brent crude July contract rose by 76 cents to $82.88 per barrel by 1411 GMT, while the more active August contract increased by 80 cents to $82.64. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed by 78 cents to $78.50. Brent decreased approximately 2 per cent last week. In comparison, WTI saw a nearly 3 per cent decline following the release of Federal Reserve minutes, indicating that certain officials might consider further interest rate hikes if deemed essential to manage persistently high inflation. Also read: “Oil prices have started the session slightly higher, but moves are expected to be in range as the U.S. and U.K. markets close today. However, in the week ahead, prices could see high volatility with the focus on the U.S. fuel demand during the current summer driving season, U.S. oil inventory data due on Wednesday, and the OPEC+ members meeting on 2nd June, where they are expected to roll-over current output cuts till year-end,\" said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd.

        "description": "Only 107 of more than 20 000 polling stations were unable to open on Monday for special votes",
        "content": "D ay one of special voting for the national and provincial elections got off to what the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) described as a “good start”, despite disruption in the Mthatha area. IEC deputy chief electoral officer Masego Sheburi told journalists on Monday afternoon that by 2pm, more than 200 000 of the 1.6 million registered special votes had been cast at the country’s 22 000 voting stations. Sheburi said that “factors external to the electoral programme” had prevented the operation of 107 polling stations in the OR Tambo region, because of a taxi strike and resultant violence in the Mthatha area. A total of 435 polling stations out of 22 626 had experienced delays in opening, but only those affected by the disruptions at Mthatha had been unable to open at all, he said. “Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections,” he said.“The commission continues to work with stakeholders to have them open tomorrow.” The IEC said 624 593 voters would cast their special votes at home or in places of confinement, while prisoners who had registered would get to participate on 29 May. Sheburi said the commission believed “good progress” had been made with the process thus far and that the special votes would be stored securely and then added to the ballots cast on Wednesday before counting begins. The IEC was aware of the disinformation and misinformation taking place on social media, including a video portraying ballots being filled in, he said, adding that the video being circulated was “clearly” not of a South Africa ballot paper. “We urge voters and candidates to be vigilant of misinformation and disinformation,” he said. Sheburi said the difficulties the electoral body faced were “not comparable” to the huge number of voting stations and that the number of those with problems was “insignificant”. Deputy IEC chief executive Mawetu Mosery said 170 organisations had been accredited as election observers, 18 of them international, with both the African Union and South African Development Community missions already on the ground at polling stations. Mosery said the IEC had met the leaders of the uMkhonto weSizwe party following the breaching of a commission warehouse by its members and had “established rules of engagement” for their conduct. The matter was still being “processed” by the police and the IEC as to whether a criminal case would follow. Mosery said the IEC “responds reluctantly” to complaints by the MK party over the presence of its founder — Jabulani Khumalo — at the results operations centre (ROC) last week despite his expulsion from the party. “We cannot always be speaking about one political party amongst the 70 plus parties that are contesting these elections,” Mosery said. He said members of the public were allowed to enter the results operations centre on day passes in limited numbers and Khumalo had been present at the centre in terms of this arrangement.",

        "content": "BARRY Keoghan has revealed the real reason he turned down a role in the Gladiator sequel and admitted \"it's a shame\". The Saltburn actor was originally cast to be a part of the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator - expected to be released this November. However, Barry has now revealed that it was a simple conflict of schedules that led him to walk away from the role. Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival , the Irish actor shared his regrets about not taking the role as he said: \"I am a massive fan of Gladiator and a massive fan of that cast. \"It’s a shame you can’t do both. But that happens in this game. You can’t do both... It always happens.\" The Dublin man explained how at the time, he was \"shooting in two different countries\" and added \"that always makes it really difficult\". The new Gladiator sequel will see fellow Irish man Paul Mescal play the leading role and is set to be released in cinemas on November 22, 2024. And Barry recently paid a sweet tribute to his late mum with a special item at the Cannes Film Festival. The Saltburn actor attended the star-studded event for a second day to promote his latest film Bird last week. The Hollywood star looked super smart as he posed on the red carpet alongside his fellow cast mates. The 31-year-old wore a simple white t-shirt tucked into a pair of pinstriped tailored trousers. The Irish star finished off the look with some cool black sunglasses and black dress shoes. And the Dublin lad also paid a heart-warming tribute to his mum by wearing a silver bracelet which had her name engraved onto it. Barry kept her memory alive as he proudly showed off the jewellery while strutting down the red carpet. The Love/Hate star's mother died over 19 years ago from a heroin overdose. Barry and his brother went on to spend time in over 13 foster homes before they were taken in by his grandmother and aunt. The Irish actor has been open about his mother's addition and tragic death, and he told GQ magazine that he still thinks about her often. He said: \"My mother, always. She’s many years passed now, but I always think about her anyway. \"It’s always just in and around achievements that it’s really prominent cause you’d like to celebrate that with her you know?.\"",

        "content": "ROBBIE HENSHAW admitted the post-mortem for Leinster’s Champions Cup failure will be brutal — as they should have won. The Blues lost 31-22 to Toulouse after extra-time in an all-time classic game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday. The province were chasing the French side throughout but were still heartbroken to lose as it felt like their name was on the cup. During normal time, neither side scored a try though it was Leo Cullen’s men who dominated possession and territory. They also had the better opportunities. And it was Leinster who had the chance to win it in 80 minutes when Ciarán Frawley’s drop-goal attempt was just off target. After that Toulouse took advantage of James Lowe’s sin-binning to score ten points before Leinster clawed seven back after Richie Arnold was sent off. Yet, with a man advantage and a three-point deficit with ten minutes to go, it was Leinster who lost their discipline and gifted Toulouse two kickable penalties. Henshaw (below) said: “It’s a tough one to take. Hard to summarise it. “It was a game that had everything. “Probably, looking back we were a little bit, I don’t know, not ourselves in that first period. “In that first half we had loads of chances and a few balls just didn’t go to hand whereas it usually would. “It will be tough to look back on it and see where it was lost. We had loads of chances. “We didn’t hit our full performance. We let ourselves down a little bit around the ruck, the breakdown, they came hard there at us and that stopped the momentum at crucial times. “It was probably just down to our own little bits of errors that let us down and a few balls didn’t go to hand. “We hold on to them and keep building pressure and score, I think.” The fact that it was Leinster’s third Champions Cup final defeat in a row means it hurts more. And it raises questions about the side’s big-game ability. Last year, they led by 17 points but had a terrible second-half performance against Ronan O’Gara’s La Rochelle. But Ireland and Lions star Henshaw argued that being so close this year shows they will be back. He added: “The difference between this year and last year is we fully believed, even up to the last few minutes, that we were going to go and win. “There is full confidence in the group that we will win. “Obviously not this year but we’ll keep building and keep building. “We can’t look back, you have to keep going forward.” And he insisted that the best tonic for the Champions Cup loss is to ensure that 2024 is not the third trophyless season in a row for Leinster. Now they will turn their focus on the URC. The Blues, currently third in the table, host Connacht at the RDS on Friday. He added: “We have a chance to go out next week and put our best shot into the URC and try and win a trophy this year.”",

        "content": "Fourteen years after an innocent couple was murdered outside of Cranbrook, family and relatives are still yearning for justice. On May 29, 2010, Leanne MacFarlane and Jeffrey Todd Taylor were killed in a rural residence east of Cranbrook in a horrific case of mistaken identity, as authorities theorized the same home’s previous occupant — a man with alleged gang ties — was the intended target. MacFarlane and Taylor were engaged and had just moved to Cranbrook from Salmon Arm, as they were in the process of opening up a cellphone store with a life of promise and opportunity ahead of them. “She was such a special soul,” said Wendy Holland, MacFarlane’s sister. “She always found something good in everyone and everything. She had such a great love for animals and never lived without them and her main love was dogs and horses. There are so many special and funny stories of her growing up and things that she did. She had such a great sense of humour and zest for life.” Taylor was a man who “loved my sister and her kids immensely,” said Holland. Eight years passed before arrests were made in the case. Colin Correia and Sheldon Hunter were charged with murder in 2018, however, they were acquitted after a lengthy 150-day trial that took over three years to prosecute due to pandemic-related delays. In a Vancouver courtroom on April 25, 2022, Justice Silverman delivered a not guilty verdict based on three factors. According to Silverman’s ruling, evidence established that the intended victim did not live at the home at the time and further, there was reasonable doubt whether the two accused knew that the intended target did not live at the residence and hadn’t for months. Secondly, the credibility of a key witness was “suspect,” while thirdly, cellphone and alibi evidence raised reasonable doubt that Hunter could have been in a different location at the time. “I am not satisfied that the two accused persons are innocent,” wrote Silverman, in his decision. “However, I am also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they are guilty.” Crown signalled an intent to appeal, filing notice a month after the decision and an amended notice last summer. Crown lawyers made submissions to the Court of Appeal over two days in March, with a decision yet to come. If the Crown appeal is successful, a new trial could be ordered. On the grounds for appeal, the Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by excluding as involuntary statements that the defendant had made to police. The Crown also submits that the trial judge erred by excluding law enforcement evidence regarding measurements taken of the defendant’s shoes. A B.C. Prosecution Service spokesperson confirmed the Crown’s appeal applies only to Correia, and that the appeal of Hunter’s acquittal was abandoned.",

The 25-year-old UAE Emirates rider won six of the 21 stages on the 3,400km tour that began in Turin, finishing 9min 56sec ahead of Colombia’s Daniel Martinez of Bora while Geraint Thomas of Ineos was 10min 24sec off the winning pace in third. The overall triumph was sealed Sunday on the 21st stage around Rome, which was won by Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier, who picked up his third stage win of the 2024 Giro. Billed as a champion in waiting, Pogacar proved peerless taking the lead as early as stage two and rampaging across the peaks, plains and picturesque panoramas to triumph by the largest margin at any of cycling’s grand tours since Vittorio Adorni won the Giro by 11min 26sec in 1965. The swashbuckling Slovenian showman was decked out in the iconic pink leader’s jersey, riding a pink bike and even arriving on a pink bus as the route raced south. Hoping to become the first rider to win both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France since Marco Pantani in 1998, Pogacar resembled more another rider, Eddy Merckx, also known for wanting to win as many stages as possible. He won the opening time-trial, and the following day’s first major summit finish and would go on to romp home on the Queen stage in the Dolomites, doubling his lead in the process. Italians took to Pogacar, cheering him through the dramatic port of Genoa, the chic Tuscan town of Lucca and the southern port of Naples and Pompei in the shadow of the volcanic Mount Vesuvius. The two-time Tour de France winner had extended his lead slowly up the Adriatic coastline before the third week’s relentless series of ascents and descents in the Alps. Out to prove Merckx wrong Should Pogacar pull off the ambitious Giro-Tour double he will join a list of legends in Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Stephen Roche, Miguel Indurain and Pantani. Pogacar burst onto the scene winning three stages at the Vuelta a Espana in 2019 and coming third. The following year he pulled off one of cycling’s biggest ever surprises when he overhauled a 90-second gap on Primoz Roglic to take the lead at the very end of the Tour de France in 2020. In 2021, Pogacar dominated the Tour to claim back-to-back triumphs, before a rival emerged in the form of Danish Visma rider Jonas Vingegaard. The wispy Dane has dominated Pogacar on the very toughest mountain stages, allowing Pogacar to tack up the stage wins as he himself remained firmly focused on the overall. Merckx stated in 2023 that for now the Dane was the best Grand Tour rider, but Vingegaard is scrambling to achieve top fitness for the Tour de France after a nasty crash at the Tour of the Basque Country. While Pogacar had no visible rival at the Giro, Vingegaard will be just one hazard to watch out for on the French roads, with Belgian maverick Remco Evenepoel, Colombian climber Egan Bernal and old foe Roglic all muddying the waters on a wide-open roster ripe for surprises this July. — AFP",

        "content": "According to a reliable source, Samsung plans to bring a considerable upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s camera array, delivering better secondary sensors. Samsung’s formula for the “Ultra” series hasn’t changed a whole lot in the past couple of generations, especially when it comes to the camera. A super high-resolution main sensor is backed up by a trio of telephoto and ultrawide lenses, typically with much lower resolution. The Galaxy S24 Ultra uses a 200MP main camera, 50MP 5x telephoto camera, 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 12MP sensor for ultrawide shots. It’s not all that different from the years prior. The S23 Ultra was nearly identical, except both its telephoto cameras had 10MP sensors, and the only difference on the S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra was the use of a 108MP main camera. That may be changing this time around, though, as some considerable upgrades are coming. Ice Universe says on Weibo that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will use the same 200MP resolution camera as the S24 Ultra, but with 50MP cameras used on both telephoto cameras as well as the ultrawide. The language used, mainly due to translation, leaves a little bit of room for confusion, but it sounds like a whole lot more resolution is coming to Samsung’s next flagship camera setup. We’re still quite a ways out, though. Samsung usually launches its flagship Galaxy S series in January, meaning we’re several months from that launch, and things could change in the meantime. Still, it sounds like a welcome upgrade. Hopefully, it’ll also come with some software improvements, as that’s always been the bigger problem .

        "content": "The Africa Tourism Research Network (ATRN), in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) has organised a three-day training workshop session for 40 informal sector workers in the tourism and hospitality industry in Tamale. The workshop is under the Global Programme on Skills and Lifelong Learning/SKILL UP Ghana Project, an ILO initiative in collaboration with the Commission for Technical and Vocational Education and Training and funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. Beneficiaries of the workshop were drawn from the Traditional Caterers Association, Indigenous Caterers Association, Tour Guides Association of Ghana and Smock Weavers Association. The rest were from the Cultural Dance Association, Smock Sewers Association, and the Shea Butter Processing Association. Addressing participants, Regional Director of the Ghana Tourism Authority, Mr. Angelo Dogbe, underscored the need for the participants to acknowledge and embrace the role digitization and social media now play in their work. He urged them to take advantage of the workshop to improve their work and benefit from the opportunities on social media platforms. He assured the participants that his office would give them the needed support and pledged to help them to regularise their businesses. Ms. Vanessa Lareto Phala, the ILO Country Director for Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone and the Laison for ECOWAS, noted that as part of its core mandate, the ILO was poised to collaborate with the Government of Ghana and key stakeholder institutions to support, train and build capacities of constituents in various sectors of the economy to create decent and sustainable jobs especially for the youth and women. Mr. Frank Kwasi Adetor, National Project Coordinator of ILO’s Global Programme on Skills and Lifelong Learning, said digital marketing and social media skills played a pivotal role in promoting and sustaining businesses especially in the post COVID19 era. “I wish to admonish participants to take full advantage of the training by imparting the knowledge and skills acquired to others. He said, “you can only succeed in transcending the borders of Ghana by conforming to and upholding international standards in your business operations.” Mr Emmanuel Frimpong, Founding President, ATRN, emphasized the critical role digitization and credible data played in the tourism and hospitality sector. He said, “over 80 per cent of the players in this sector are informal yet they play a critical role in creating decent jobs for the youth and women, therefore it is important you are given the needed tools to take advantage of the benefits of social media marketing”. He called on other development partners, the government, and organisations to partner with ATRN to train more informal sector workers in the tourism, hospitality and travel sectors in areas where they lack the needed skills. He thanked the ILO for supporting the sector over the years, especially during the COVID-19 period. The workshop was facilitated by Mr. Elorm Billy-Awittor from the African Skills Hub (ASH) with support from the ILO’s Global Programme on Skills and Lifelong Learning/SKILL UP Ghana Component.",

        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. In Brief SSV.Network plans to decrease hardware demands by 75-90%, employing cryptography, consensus, and network optimization. Ethereum staking infrastructure unveiled its roadmap outlining the upcoming developments for the project. Over the course of the next year, SSV Labs aims to progressively decrease hardware demands by 75-90% through a series of phases, employing cryptography, consensus, and network optimization. SSV.Network initiated cryptography optimizations earlier this year, with plans for consensus adjustments slated for the third quarter, necessitating a fork in the process. The overarching objective of the project is to enable the network to accommodate over 200,000 validators, all while maintaining hardware prerequisites at 4-core CPUs. SSV.Network builds a permissionless zero-coordination (DVT) network, permitting individuals to run an operator and register a validator without requiring any off-chain coordination. During the latter half of the year, the project has identified crucial bottlenecks and potential ways of improvement, facilitating the expansion of the network’s overall scale while adhering to the 4-core per operator entry threshold. These enhancements include reducing the time (CPU cycles) required to process a message, minimizing the number of messages each new validator contributes, and reducing the amount of non-committee messages received by operators. Reducing message processing time was critical due to the necessity for node operators to verify all received messages. A recent implementation of transitioning to RSA signatures resulted in a 98% reduction in message signature verification time. Further enhancement in cryptography entails transitioning from RSA to a more concise signature scheme, which remains significantly faster than BLS12–381. Options such as EDSA + ECIES are being evaluated for potential adoption. Moreover, the optimization, referred to as committee-based consensus, has been a focal point for the SSV Labs team. It is expected to be integrated into the mainnet by Q3 of 2024, necessitating a fork. Upon implementation, the project foresees a reduction in the total number of messages exchanged within the network to just 13% of the current volume. While efforts are being made to reduce the number of messages added by each new validator, the focus also remains on how many operators need to process each message. This number can potentially be decreased. The SSV Labs team is actively researching network topology, with one solution being to group validators by cluster. This approach would ensure that all validators within a specific cluster belong to the same topic, maintaining the same upper-bound topic count. Such a change in network topology could reduce message processing by approximately 98%, as operators would need to process significantly fewer non-committee messages. Over the next 12 months, SSV.Network aims to surpass 50,000 validators. The solutions implemented are expected to support this growth without raising the entry barrier by requiring expensive hardware. is a fully decentralized, open-source Ethereum staking network utilizing Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology, also referred to as . This technology facilitates an open and straightforward infrastructure for dividing and distributing a validator key into multiple KeyShares, allowing an Ethereum validator to operate across several non-trusting nodes. Recently, SSV.Network shared some milestones, highlighting the network’s growth over the past few months. Notably, the network now boasts nearly 500 operators and over 21,000 validators. Additionally, the project has recorded a total of 678,000 staked ETH, translating to over $2.7 billion in total value locked (TVL).

        "content": "The federal government has asked members of the National Assembly to subject the Nigerian National Anthem Bill to wider consultations before passing it. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, stated this in Abuja on Monday at a public hearing on the bill to revert to the old national anthem. It is titled: “A Bill for an Act to Provide for the National Anthem of Nigeria, and for Matters Related,” The hearing was jointly organised by the Senate Committees on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters and Interior, to which it was referred by the Senate on Thursday after it scaled second reading. The House of Representatives accelerated and passed the bill in a single sitting on Thursday. Mr Fagbemi said there was a need for a wider process where Nigerians and other arms and tiers of government would participate in the decision to revert to the old national anthem before it finally becomes law. He specifically proposed consultations through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. PREMIUM TIMES delivers fact-based journalism for Nigerians, by Nigerians — and our community of supporters, the readers who donate, make our work possible.

I thank you all for granting me the audience to contribute my thoughts to this national cause,” the minister added. Also speaking at the hearing, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, recommended that the scope of the bill should be expanded to include a robust issue of national identity rather than limiting it to a change of national anthem. Mr Idris, represented by the Director-General of the National Orientation Agency, Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem do not make a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a subset. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not have a valued national identity, of which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning and imbibing it,” he added. The Senate Leader, Opeyemi Bamidele, who represented the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, chaired the hearing.

        "content": "Ireland has joined a European-wide effort to underscore the importance of plant health; part of which focuses on educating people to not bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits or vegetables from outside the EU when returning from their travels, lest they introduce plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. The #PlantHealth4Life campaign is led by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Commission (EC), and is active in 22 European member states. Senator Pippa Hackett, Minister of State for Land Use and Biodiversity with special responsibility for Horticulture at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said: “We are proud to stand alongside our European partners to raise awareness of the profound interdependence between plant health and our collective well-being. This collaborative effort is a unique opportunity to engage citizens from all walks of life — be it the intrepid traveller, the conscientious gardener, or the vigilant parent — in safeguarding plant health.” Louise Byrne, Chief Plant Health Officer for Ireland, added that the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine conducts comprehensive inspections on imports of regulated plants and plant products. Importantly however, a critical element is educating the public across all spectrums, from commercial importers to amateur gardeners on the need for heightened awareness of the issues at stake and to not attempt to import unchecked plants and plant products that pose a risk to Ireland. The campaign urges travellers not to bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits, or vegetables from outside the EU, as these items may harbour plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. Additionally, consumers are advised to buy plants and seeds online only if accompanied by a valid phytosanitary or plant health certificate. Embracing good plant hygiene practices and promptly addressing signs of plant pests or diseases in home gardens and communal outdoor spaces will also prevent their spread to neighbouring plants and natural habitats. Speaking on Ireland’s involvement in the campaign, leading Irish garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, who was appointed as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations’ Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland in May 2022, said: “Safeguarding Irish plant health is paramount. As gardeners, we hold the power to effect change — by allowing our gardens to flourish naturally, propagating your own plants from seeds, sourcing plants responsibly, and vigilantly monitoring for abnormalities, we can collectively protect our botanical heritage.” © ITTN.ie",

        "content": "One of the strengths of the Green Bay Packers on defense is their pass rush. Leading the way is Rashan Gary, fresh off a monster extension signed in 2023. When healthy, he has been one of the most dominant pass rushers in the NFL. Despite being on a pitch count last season as he worked his way back from ACL surgery, opponents could not block him. Rashan Gary ranked near the NFL in several pass-rushing categories and the Packers hope that continues in 2024 and beyond. Green Bay has a solid mix of options to mix in along with Gary. Veteran Preston Smith is still on the roster and the team has young players such as Lukas Van Ness looking to make an impact. A first-round pick in 2023, Van Ness was brought along slowly, as many Packers rookies are. But, in the second half of the season, we got a glimpse of what could be on the horizon. Over the final eight games of the season, including the playoffs, the Iowa product racked up 4.0 sacks and eight quarterback hits. It wasn’t a product of receiving more playing time, as Van Ness played over 50 percent of the defensive snaps only once in that stretch; Super Wild Card Weekend against the Dallas Cowboys. Rashan Gary praised the work his young teammate has put in, as he couldn’t hide his smile when asked about Van Ness. “He’s not even scratching the surface, man. He’s just starting,” Gary said . “The player he was coming in, from rookie minicamp to the guy he’s leaving now to have an offseason to work on his game, is completely different. “I know it’s going to be a big jump next year because he has the same type of work ethic as me and he’s hungry for everything he has in front of him ... He understands what he needs to work on, and I know he’s going to get better at it. I just can’t wait to see him tear it up next year.” That is some very high praise for the 2023 first-round pick from Rashan Gary. You aren’t going to find many, if any people that would argue against that. Van Ness has all of the tools to become a dominant pass rusher, giving the Green Bay Packers a potentially dominant duo to rely on.

        "content": "Professional cycling is back in the mainstream spotlight with the second season of Tour de France: Unchained on Netflix , this time with Tadej Pogačar among the riders featured. The series is due to air on June 11, 2024, on the video streaming platform. While the short English trailer for the second season did not show Pogačar, the extended version published on Netflix France's YouTube channel features interviews with Pogačar and new footage of the aftermath of Pogačar's crash in Liège-Bastogne-Liège and interviews from his home with partner Urška Žigart and in a studio. \"2022, I gave everything that I could, but in the end, Jonas was better,\" Pogačar says before Žigart describes Pogačar's stinging defeat at the hands of Jonas Vingegaard in 2022 , saying, \"It wasn't the easiest because it's this realisation 'Oh, I'm not the best anymore' ... but then it brought back the hunger that he really wants to prove that he is the best again.\" Tour de France: Unchained debuted in 2023 as a series along the lines of the successful Drive to Survive Formula 1 show. Drive to Survive gave F1 a huge surge in popularity, and it appears that Tour de France: Unchained has yet to do the same for cycling. The 2023 Tour de France had only a small increase in viewership over 2022. The second season of Tour de France: Unchained will serve as a teaser for quite a different rematch between Vingegaard and Pogačar in July.

Pogačar just capped off a start-to-finish domination of the Giro d'Italia , winning by almost 10 minutes over Dani Martínez (Bora-Hansgrohe), while Vingegaard spent 12 days in hospital in April after a heavy crash in the Itzulia Basque Country left him with broken ribs, a collapsed lung and a fractured clavicle. This year's Tour de France will also be the first time that Vingegaard will face off against former teammate Primož Roglič, who is now with Bora-Hansgrohe, and have Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quickstep) as a rival.",

        "content": "Objections have been lodged against fresh plans to build a high-rise hotel near Galway Docks. Previously, Summix BNM Developments Limited was refused permission for a 10-storey hotel at the site by city planners. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The site at the corner of Lough Atalia Road and Bother na Long is currently occupied by a vacant industrial building. Among the reasons given for the previous refusal by An Bord Pleanala were the scale and density of the project, and the impact on nearby Forthill Cemetery. The latest plans are for an even taller building, offering 189 bedrooms across 15 storeys. An Taisce has now lodged a submission, saying the priority should be homes for students and workers, rather than even more tourist bed spaces. It also notes the increased height of the latest proposal, claiming the grounds for refusal of the previous project should be even more applicable in this case. A local priest of the Augustinian Community has also lodged a submission, raising concerns over the impact on a boundary wall at Forthill Cemetery. It says the site is of immense historical and archaelogical importance, and it’s a very sensitive issue given it’s still an active cemetery. A decision is due from city planners next month. 2460108 The post Objections to fresh plans for high-rise hotel near Galway Docks appeared first on Galway Bay FM . © Copyright 2023 - Ourside Agency",

        "description": "A beautiful UK beach named one of the country's best is also the beach most impacted by erosion in the UK, meaning it is destined to tumble beneath the waves over the coming years",
        "content": "One of the UK's best beaches, known for its orange cliffs and serene sand, could soon disappear and be washed away into the sea. Known for its peacefulness and remote location, Covehithe beach in Suffolk has been named as one of the best beaches in the UK by the The Sunday Times. However, the under-the-radar beach may not be around for much longer as it suffers from the highest rate of erosion in the country of any beach. Between the 1830s and 2001, the cliff-face has lost over 500 metres and according to the area's Shoreline Management Plan, Clovehithe's cliffs erode around 4.5 metres a year. The Environment Agency has warned that the main part of the settlement at Covehithe - which is roughly 250 metres from the shoreline - is expected to be claimed by the sea by 2110. However, it could tumble beneath the waves as early as 2040. As a consequence, the cliffs in the area pose a constant risk to members of the public who visit the beach. Have you visited somewhere that is a beautiful under-the-radar location? Email us at webtravel@reachplc.com Beautiful UK seaside town named 'by far the cleanest' and 'happiest place' Covehithe Beach suffers from extreme erosion, losing 4.5 metres a year Despite their fast erosion, the orange cliffs at Covehithe still offer a picturesque landscape, that benefits from little crowds. The beach can be accessed via a lane, which leads to fields before abruptly stopping at the cliff edge. Walk further along the beach and you'll find the ruins of the medieval St Andrews Church, which became too expensive for the parish to maintain and was eventually left for ruin, before a new smaller church was built within its grounds. The beach is also home to Southwold's old Victorian pier and Benacre Broad Bird Hide, a bird watching area. One review of the beach reads: \"My favourite beach in Suffolk. It’s so unique, there are broads on the beach so you can be between two bodies if water which is quite surreal if you ask me. Lots of wild life such as birds and the occasional seal. The beach is very sandy with the odd stone/pebble nearer the shore.\" While there isn't much to do at the beach itself, further along the coastline is the town of Lowestoft. The seaside town has a rich heritage and culture, including attractions like The Gulliver wind turbine, Marina Theatre, Pleasurewood Hills and a 100-acre zoo, Africa-Alive. Slightly further along the coast is also Great Yarmouth — home to the Golden Mile of beaches. Both are easily accessible by car. If venturing out in a car is not for you, walking further south will get you to the town of Southwold. Located next to Covehithe beach, Southwold offers an array of accommodation and a selection of eating establishments. Still Southwold accommodation is closest to the beach, with various holiday homes available. The Listening Station is a custom-built beach household, with views towards the cliffs and beaches of Covehithe. It can sleep up to four people and one small dog. The Watch Room looks out towards Southwold Pier, also sleeping up to four people. Alternatively, if only two of you, you could stay in The Easternmost Cabin , which is built on the site of three former Victorian workers' cottages. For bigger parties, The Warren House sleeps up to eight people and one dog and was originally was built as a farmhouse in 1925. A minimum stay of three days is required, starting at prices of around £600. Covehithe might not be the place for a holiday with children, or if you fancy the typical tourist attractions usually found at seaside towns. But it is perfect for those wanting to see beautiful scenery in a quiet and remote location. Check out more of Daily Mirror's latest travel stories by signing up to our free weekly newsletter.",

        "content": "The Florida Panthers dominated the New York Rangers in most statistical categories in Game 3, except for goaltending and defensive coverage mistakes. The differences in those areas are why the Panthers are hoping to even up the Eastern Conference Final series in Game 4 Tuesday night in Sunrise, Fla., and why the Rangers are seeking a 3-1 lead. If the Rangers can win again, they will get a chance to clinch the series on home ice Thursday in Game 5. If the Panthers can earn a split at home, they will assure themselves of hosting Game 6 on Saturday night. The Panthers opened the series with an impressive 3-0 victory in New York. However, the Rangers have rebounded with a pair of overtime wins -- despite Florida controlling large portions of both games -- thanks to Igor Shesterkin, who has a 2.33 goals-against average in the postseason and has stopped 83 of 90 shots in the series. \"We have a no-panic mentality that's kind of relied on in those moments when we're under siege,\" New York forward Barclay Goodrow said. \"It might get ugly sometimes, but guys had to block some shots and (Igor Shesterkin) made huge saves. In the end, a win's a win.\" The Rangers earned Sunday's 5-4 win when Alex Wennberg beat Sergei Bobrovsky by scoring on a deflection of a Ryan Lindgren shot 5:35 into overtime. Wennberg was left alone at the net by Florida defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson after the Panthers won a defensive zone faceoff but saw defenseman Dmitry Kulikov lose the puck. Wennberg's game-winner came after the Rangers blew a two-goal lead by allowing tallies to Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling in a span of 1:54 in the third period. The Panthers had plenty of chances to get the lead in the third by outshooting the Rangers 13-4. Forsling hit the post with about eight minutes left and Matthew Tkachuk was stopped by Shesterkin when he was alone in front with 39 seconds left. The Panthers outshot the Rangers by a 37-23 margin and scored twice on six power plays in Game 3 but also gave up five goals for the third time in the postseason. \"When you put up whatever we put up tonight and you don't come away with a win, you should be a little growly,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. Sam Reinhart scored two power play goals for Florida in the first period, but the Panthers gave up two goals apiece to Alexis Lafreniere and Goodrow before coming back. Lafreniere scored on a breakaway and on an end-to-end rush while Goodrow scored on a deflection and a short-handed goal during Florida's four-minute power play in the second period. \"You can say we dominated, but then you look at the mistakes that led to their goals,\" Reinhart said. \"So, there's areas for improvement, for sure.\" Perhaps even more of a source of frustration for the Panthers is that the Rangers are leading in the series without Mika Zibanejad, Artemi Panarin and Chris Kreider getting a point so far. Zibanejad took three shots on goal while Panarin and Kreider took one shot apiece on Sunday. \"Finding ways to win is huge in the playoffs,\" said New York's Vincent Trocheck, who collected two assists after setting up Goodrow's game-winner in overtime on Friday. \"It doesn't really matter whether it's overtime, regulation, up two late, down two late. We just try to work for wins.\" This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "BOYLE HEIGHTS, Calif. (KABC) -- Dozens of car enthusiasts gathered in Boyle Heights to help veterans struggling with P-T-S-D, addiction, and other mental health issues. The event was hosted by a non-profit whose mission is to inspire veterans to be hopeful about their future. The cars lined Cesar Chavez Blvd. for the Armed Forces Day paint and chrome show. It's a big fundraiser for non-profit Operation Restoring Veteran Hope. \"Isolation and self-medication recipe for disaster so getting out in the community - learning how to live life again is what it's all about,\" said Ray Perez, President Operation Restoring Veteran Hope. When Army veteran Perez got out of service, he went through homelessness, incarceration, and addiction. \"I didn't realize I was building my resume at the time, going down those dark roads. But here we are today and I'm very blessed to be where I'm at, helping the people that we do,\" said Perez. Perez started the program in 2019. His wife Maria had issues with anxiety when she got out. \"It made it hard just being around people. People as a whole, being around big group, talking to people. not trusting people.\" Maria, now a social worker, eventually found the resources she needed. Together - they help vets work through addiction, PTSD, suicidal ideation; and those who come from jail, prison, and rehab. Events like this car show help build camaraderie. \"They help transform people, give you job skills,\" said Richard Olvera, Marine Corps veteran. \"They show you're worth something again. they give you a mission. they give you a sense of brotherhood that you had when you're in the service. they give you everything you need to succeed.\"",

The city’s mayor said he wanted to negotiate with the city’s port authorities to reach a new agreement which would reduce the number of terminals where cruise ships could arrive. Last year, 803 cruise ships docked in Barcelona , carrying 3.5 million passengers. This figure is a rise of 13.7 percent compared with pre-pandemic figures in 2019. Of these visitors, 46 percent - 1.6 million - only spent one day in the city before returning to the ship.

We want to propose a new agreement with the port about the number of terminals,” Jordi Valls, head of tourism for Barcelona city council, told El País newspaper. “Each year the number of cruise tourists rises about 9 per cent and that is not acceptable for the city.” Every time a ship docks, on average 3,000 people then descend on the already crowded city , which has a population of only 1.6 million in a space only 39 square miles - six times smaller than London. Adding insult to injury, the cruise industry argues that each passenger contributes an average of £78 per day to the local economy. “If we exceed the capacity that Barcelona can support,” added Valls, “what the visitors contribute no longer has value.” Currently, two new cruise terminals are being planned, adding to the five already operational. The city’s mayor, Jaume Collboni , said he instead wanted to see this reduced. Don't miss... Valencia and Barcelona 'to limit and even BAN' mega cruise liners in backlash [LATEST] Major cruise line cancels trips to island destination [LATEST] Popular cruise line forced to change route due to restrictions [LATEST] Trending Didac Navarro, of the Stop Cruises campaign group, said if nothing was done then Barcelona would soon receive 5 million cruise tourists each year. “The roads and pavements in the centre of the city and near the Sagrada Familia are already saturated with cruise tourists and this model is unsustainable,” he told i . He applauded the council’s move to limit the number of ships, something, he said, they had been asking for “from the start”. In October, Barcelona announced it would restrict access of cruise liners to its congested city centre in an attempt to combat over-tourism. Most arrivals at the Mediterranean port will now have to dock away from the World Trade Center pier, which is just a short walk from La Rambla Boulevard, the busiest street in the city. The move comes as protests take place against over-tourism , which has been pricing out locals from towns and cities across Spain. About 10,000 people protested in the Balearic Island of Palma de Mallorca on Saturday, Spanish police said, with smaller protests in Menorca and Ibiza. Barcelona is the next to follow in the footsteps of other European cities in limiting cruise ships. In 2021, Venice banned cruise ships from its centre and Palma in Mallorca cut the number of ships arriving to three per day until 2026 with only one being allowed to carry more than 5,000 passengers.

        "description": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026.",
        "content": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026. In the latest Monetary Policy Report, analysts said by the end of this year, the monetary authorities could cut policy rates by 25 to 150 bps. For 2025, the analysts said, the BSP could loosen its policy stance by a range of 25 to 250 bps; while in 2026, analysts expect an additional reduction of about 50 to 150 bps in the policy rate. “The results of the survey showed that most of the analysts anticipate current monetary policy settings to remain unchanged in Q2 [second quarter] 2024,” the report stated. This outlook on policy rates is consistent with expectations that inflation will slow to 3.7 percent in 2024 from the initial estimate of 3.8 percent. Inflation forecasts by analysts for 2025 remains unchanged at 3.5 percent but higher in 2026 at 3.5 percent from the initial outlook of 3.4 percent. “Analysts expect within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers. Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply chain disruptions,” the report stated. The local analysts said the primary upside risks to inflation are higher oil and food costs, including rice. The price of these basic goods, the report stated, are affected by supply-side pressures due to geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. In April 2024, rice inflation slowed to 23.9 percent from the 24.4 percent posted in March 2024. Rice inflation has been above 20 percent since January 2024. The list of upside risks also includes the impact of extreme weather events such as El Niño in the first half of 2024 and the La Niña in the second semester. Based on the latest report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the severe dry spell affected 175,063 farmers and fisherfolk and cost the economy P9.496 billion in damages. On Monday, the NDRRMC also reported that Tropical Cyclone Aghon has affected 19,373 Filipinos and displaced 5,343 residents. While estimates of the damage are not yet available, 22 damaged homes and 13 flooded areas were initially reported. “A few analysts cited downside risks from easing albeit still elevated food and non-food inflation, such as rice and oil; and waning inflationary pressures on prices as El Niño and base effects weaken in the near term,” the report added. The report also noted that 15 out of 20 respondents said there is a higher chance, 77.2 percent, that inflation will settle within the 2 to 4 percent inflation target of the BSP. In April, analysts said there is only a 71.5-percent this can happen this year. However, analysts said there is a 22.8-percent probability, lower than the 28.3 percent posted in April 2024, that inflation will breach the upper end of the target range. For 2025, analysts said the probability that inflation will fall within the target band increased to 85.3 percent, higher than the 78.2 percent expectation in April. The report said that for 2026, there is a 73.5-percent probability, lower than the initial 76.5 percent, that inflation will settle within the target band. More expensive rice and vegetables and higher transport costs caused inflation in April to accelerate to 3.8 percent, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said last May 21. The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) and the Department of Finance (DOF) said the government is now fast-tracking interventions to beef up food supply to shield consumers from the ill effects of El Niño as well as La Niña. Data released by the PSA indicated that inflation quickened for the third consecutive month in April. The inflation rate last month was faster than the 3.7 percent recorded in March, but slower than the 6.6 percent in April 2023. Citing data from the PSA, Neda noted that April witnessed a “surge” in food inflation, which rose to 6.3 percent from the previous month’s 5.7 percent. Key contributors include vegetables, up by 4.3 percent; fish, up by 0.4 percent and ready-made products up by 4.8 percent.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 China ‘s first domestically built large cruise ship Adora Magic City has completed 34 journeys and received nearly 150,000 tourists so far since its maiden voyage. In the meantime, China ‘s second homegrown large cruise ship entered a shipyard in Shanghai for final assembly on April 20, signifying that China has developed the capability to engage in bulk production of cruise ships. The cruise industry, with a long industrial chain and high degree of internationalization, is often called “the golden industry that floats.” Over 1,000 domestic and foreign manufacturers were involved in the building of Adora Magic City. The cruise ship is 323.6 meters in length, has a gross weight of 135,500 tons, and can accommodate up to 5,246 passengers across a total of 2,125 guest rooms. The number of parts is equivalent to five times that of the C919 large aircraft and 13 times that of the Fuxing high-speed train. China has since become the fifth country in the world with the ability to design and build large cruise ships. The commercial success of Adora Magic City also demonstrates that China is capable of complete and independent operation of large cruise ships, according to Liu Hui, general manager of CSSC Cruise Technology Development Co Ltd. In comparison to Adora Magic City, the new ship boasts a larger size, with a tonnage of over 140,000 tons, a length of 341 meters, a width of 37.2 meters, and features 2,144 cabins. Two sets of desulfurization systems and five sets of selective catalytic reduction equipment will be added, making the entire ship more environmentally friendly. Also compared with Adora Magic City, the area of public spaces, and for outdoor activities and leisure has increased by 735 square meters and 1,913 square meters, respectively, to 25,599 square meters and 14,272 square meters, further improving the comfort and experience of passengers. Although the ship is larger, the construction speed has been accelerated thanks to a series of scientific research achievements, management experience and methods. It is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026. In addition to the large cruise ship, the Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co Ltd has also stepped up the research and development of ultra-large as well as medium and small cruise ships. A large domestic cruise fleet is on the way.",

        "description": "Jacks struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls and helped RCB chase down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in an IPL match with Kohli looking on from the other end.",
        "content": "Will Jacks hopes to put the on-field “coaching” he received from Virat Kohli to good use when England bids to retain its T20 World Cup title next month. Jacks goes into the third game of England’s warm-up series against Pakistan having helped propel the hosts to a 23-run win at Edgbaston on Saturday. The Surrey all-rounder struck a quickfire 37 in what proved to be a decisive stand with captain Jos Buttler as England went 1-0 up in the rain-hit four-match series ahead of Tuesday’s game at Cardiff’s Sophia Gardens. It was another example of Jacks’ power hitting after he recently struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls -- including 28 runs from one Rashid Khan over -- as Royal Challengers Bengaluru chased down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in a high-pressure situation, with India star batsman Kohli looking on from the other end. “The big thing with the IPL is that every game is such an occasion, the crowd, the atmosphere,” Jacks told reporters on Monday, just over a week from England’s World Cup opener against Scotland in Barbados. “Every game you feel like you’ve got to step up and that’s similar to international cricket.” As for batting with Kohli, the 25-year-old added: “He’s a very good role model. The way he approaches all the training and every aspect of the game off the field, his intensity, everything he does is a 100 percent attention. “He’s done it for such a long time and I can appreciate that as a young guy who often doesn’t want to do the hard yards, but you see him doing it and want to copy that.” “When we were batting together, he was coaching me through there. I learned some valuable things about chasing in that innings and pacing the game, which was really helpful,” Jacks added. “I was really proud of the way I stayed in the partnership, didn’t throw it away.” Now Jacks, whose England career currently consists of a mere two Tests, seven one-day internationals and 12 T20s, is looking forward to a major global tournament. “Playing in a World Cup is something I’ve dreamed of since I was a little kid. I’m really excited to do it,” he said. “It’s getting closer now and we’re building in the right direction.” Jacks labelled his England T20 record of 218 runs at 18.16 a “mixed bag”, although his cause has not been helped by switching between opening the innings and batting at three. “I’ve probably opened half my games and batted number three in the other half,” he said. “It’s no lie that I’m new to batting at three, I’m learning on the job.” He added, “I’ve been getting starts every game and it’s about how do I change those into match-winning scores. That’s more of a mindset thing. It doesn’t matter what I’m averaging: if the team’s winning, then it’s good.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",
