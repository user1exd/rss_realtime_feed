        "content": "Valeura Energy Inc. is a Canada-based public company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of petroleum and natural gas in Turkey. CALGARY, Alberta, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Valeura Energy Inc. (TSX:VLE, OTCQX:VLERF) (“ Valeura ” or the “ Company “), an upstream oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the Thrace Basin of Türkiye, is pleased to announce the successful completion of an infill drilling campaign at Nong Yao A and the start of development drilling on the Nong Yao C extension, both part of the Nong Yao oil field (90% operated working interest), offshore Gulf of Thailand. Sean Guest, President and CEO commented: “I am pleased with the results of our new Nong Yao A wells, which further illustrate the potential of our assets to add volumes through ongoing infill drilling. Drilling these wells now was a nimble move by our team to shore up production rates just before dedicating our rig to the Nong Yao C development drilling programme. The start of drilling operations at our brand new Nong Yao C infrastructure marks a significant milestone for our Company. This will be the first new development for Valeura in Thailand, and is expected to serve as a substantial source of production growth in the second half of this year. We remain focused on safe and sustainable growth, and I am pleased to note that our drilling operations have achieved an important safety record, logging one full year of work without a lost time injury. We remain committed to delivering a top tier health, safety, and environmental performance across all our operations.” Nong Yao A Infill Wells Valeura has drilled two production-oriented horizontal wells at the Nong Yao A wellhead platform, which were both successful and have been brought online as producers. The 37H well culminated in a horizontal section within the primary target H12.5 reservoir. That zone has been completed for production and is currently contributing approximately 500 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past ten days. In addition, the well encountered 68 feet of net oil pay across eight separate appraisal target intervals. These zones will now be further evaluated as targets for potential future development wells, and once developed, may add further producible volumes to the asset. The 38H well has been completed as a horizontal producer in the H4.3 reservoir interval and is currently contributing approximately 1,000 bbls/d of oil ( 1) , based on performance over the past five days. A thin oil-bearing sand was encountered in the shallower H2.0 sand interval and will also be studied to determine additional producible volumes. Nong Yao C Development The Company’s contracted drilling rig has moved to the Nong Yao C mobile offshore production unit where it has commenced batch drilling operations to develop the Nong Yao C field extension. The drilling campaign is anticipated to take approximately four months and will be comprised of up to nine gross wells, being six producer wells and up to three water injectors. Valeura anticipates first oil from the Nong Yao C development in Q3 2024, and thereafter is targeting aggregate peak oil production rates from the expanded Nong Yao field of 11,000 bbls/d, approximately a 50% increase over the 7,307 bbls/d reported for Q1 2024 (1) . (1) Working interest share production before royalties.

        "content": "Bedford Metals Corp., a mineral exploration company, creates value for our shareholders by identifying and developing highly prospective mineral exploration opportunities. (Image from the company webpage) VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Bedford Metals Corp. (TSX-V: BFM) (the “Company” or “Bedford”) is pleased to announce its proposed multi-phase work program for its Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , situated on the lip of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. Phase 1 of the program calls for an airborne VTEM (Time Domain Electromagnetic) survey of the project, aimed at further identifying subsurface features such as faults and folds, which may be controls of historic radioactive anomalies. Concurrently, an airborne radiometric survey will be conducted to provide additional insights into the project’s geology. Phase 2 will implement a comprehensive ground program that includes field mapping, soil sampling, and a systematic ground radiometric survey to identify new and historic anomalies. Shaw drills will be utilized in this phase. Additionally, selected features identified through prospecting and interpretation of airborne survey data will undergo further examination with a ground IP (Induced Polarization) survey to refine targets for diamond drilling. Peter Born, President of Bedford commented “We appreciate the effort by the team in designing this comprehensive exploration program for our Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project. We are excited about the potential of this project and look forward to advancing it through the proposed work program.” Bedford remains committed to conducting all exploration work to the highest environmental standards and in collaboration with local communities and indigenous nations. Environmental stewardship is a core value of the company, and it will continue to prioritize responsible resource development. As the exploration program progresses, Bedford will keep stakeholders informed with regular updates on its website and through other communication channels. About Bedford Metals Corp . Bedford Metals Corp. is a mineral exploration company. We create value for our shareholders by identifying and developing highly prospective mineral exploration opportunities. Our strategy is to advance our projects from discovery to production, allowing Bedford to achieve significant shareholder value through the entire mining life cycle. Close Lake Uranium Project lies on the eastern side of the Athabasca Basin, adjoining claims held by Cameco Corporation, the largest uranium producer in the world. The claim is approximately 245 hectares and lies within the primary exploration corridor, which hosts the Keys Lake mine, the Cigar Lake Mine and the McArthur River Mine. The property can be accessed through a network of roads and trails. Ubiquity Lake Uranium Project , covering 1382 hectares, lies just south of the bottom lip of the Athabasca Basin, adjacent to ALX Uranium’s Carpenter Lake Project to the east. Situated near the Cable Bay Shear Zone, parallel to the Virgin River Shear Zone, which hosts Cameco’s Centennial uranium deposit, the project holds immense potential. Furthermore, it is located 100 km west of Cameco’s past-producing Key Lake uranium mine, underscoring the strategic significance of its location.

        "description": "Andrew Halter delivers water from Mississippi 1,200 miles via the railroad to families on the Navajo Nation with the help of his brother.",
        "content": "Andrew Halter had been in the railroad business for 25 years, mostly in middle management roles. It was his dream job and all he ever wanted to do. But when the world shut down in 2020, and he got laid off, he needed to figure something else out. \"It came to me one day like a clap of thunder,\" Hatler, who is based in Pennsylvania, told Business Insider. Halter and his brother had long talked about the possibility of using rail to help alleviate the water crisis in the Navajo Nation. His brother, Chris Halter, runs the St. Bonaventure Indian Mission and School , located on the southeastern edge of the reservation, which spans more than 27,000 square miles across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Nearly a third of Navajo Nation residents do not have access to reliable, clean drinking water, according to the tribe. The estimated population was over 165,000 in 2020, according to census data . The mission was already delivering water via trucks to 250 families, a small portion of the Navajo who are water-scarce. The families receive about 40 gallons of water a day, far less than the 300 gallons the average American family uses. The mission has relied on a local well to get the water, but if something happened to it, all those families would be without any water virtually overnight. \"To be honest, it was always the thing that would wake me up in the middle of the night,\" Chris Halter told BI. \"If that well shuts down for some reason, what would I do next?\" Now, Halter's company, Jacob's Well , in partnership with the mission, delivers thousands of gallons of water each month from Mississippi to the Navajo Nation via the BNSF Railway. The water-by-rail served as a lifeline in 2022 when the well had to undergo repairs that lasted months. The operation has grown quickly, and Halter is focused on expanding, both to provide more water to the Navajo Nation but also potentially to other places in the West, where dried up rivers and reservoirs are leaving communities increasingly desperate for solutions. When Halter first started calling railroads about transporting drinkable water, some thought the idea was crazy. He finally got in touch with Eunice Sun at BNSF, who currently serves as the business development manager of emerging markets. Related stories \"We haven't moved potable water prior to this opportunity, really, because the economics don't necessarily pencil out in order to pay for that water and pay for the transport,\" Sun told BI. But when Halter came to her, she said he did a great job communicating his vision and business plan. Halter said right now they can transport water, depending on fuel prices and other fluctuating costs, for around 38 cents a gallon. Currently, those costs are covered almost entirely by private donations to the mission. However, as the operation scales up and he transports more tank cars of water, those costs could come down. Getting a public utility to sell him hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per month was another story. \"A lot of times, they think you're crazy,\" Halter said. Still, they were able to work out a deal with the water department of Helena, Mississippi, where Jacob's Well collects its water before it travels 1,200 miles by rail to the southwest. Once it arrives, the Navajo families can pick up water from the mission or have it delivered to their homes, just as the well water is. Originally, Halter said he couldn't even find information about how the water would travel, and it took a lot of testing before and after transport to ensure the supply stayed safe to drink. \"We've kind of had to wing it and make up our own rules as we go along and figure some things out the hard way, which we did,\" he said. It took around eight months from when Halter first contacted BNSF for the first shipment to go out, and the operation has only grown since. Halter said they currently average around two tank cars a month, which each hold 21,000 gallons of water, but the operation is capable of delivering 200,000 gallons a month if needed. They sent half a million gallons of water total in 2023. He's hoping to reach 2 million this year. It's unclear at this point how scalable or economically feasible water-by-rail will be in other places, but those involved are hopeful. Chris Halter said he's currently conducting a study that he hopes will show the project has had a sound return on investment so that he can show tribal, local, and state governments that his is a feasible option. Sun said expanding Jacob's Well wouldn't come without growing pains, but that BNSF is happy to help support the project's growth. \"It tugs at your heartstrings,\" she said, adding that it's not often she gets to work on a project that has such a direct positive impact on a local community. Halter sees water-by-rail as something that could fill a serious need in all sorts of situations, from communities whose wells run dry to natural disasters. He's already been in touch with the state of New Mexico and FEMA. He's hopeful that rail will be among the solutions that help alleviate the broader water crisis. After getting a severe case of COVID-19, Halter lost the use of his right hand and was not able to go back to work on the railroad, so he now runs Jacob's Well full time. \"It's become a driving mission to give these people water,\" he said. \"I want to be able to provide people with water at the lowest cost possible, and I want it to make enough money to support itself, but I don't need to get wealthy on it.\" For now the operation is run on donations, but they're hoping they can get grant money or other public funds to help support it in the future. \"Water is a human right,\" Halter said. \"And they should be able to have it.\" Have a news tip or a story to share?

        "content": "A YouGov Plc study commissioned by Bankrate reveals 39% of adults in the United States have a side hustle. Two in five surveyed generate additional income apart from their main job or any other primary income source, such as family assistance or trust funds. Side hustles are particularly prevalent among younger demographics. Half of millennials and just slightly more members of Gen Z take on extra jobs for extra spending money. Similarly, an online LendingTree survey from November reveals 40% of Americans say they need more money to combat inflation, while 38% point to the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, amidst this surge in freelance activity, the market has become increasingly saturated, making it a challenge for people to establish and maintain profitable businesses. NetCredit seized the opportunity to trawl through thousands of publicly available job ads on the gig platform Fiverr to find the most efficient, highest-paying single-day jobs in every country. Website design ranks as one of the top side hustles , with some designers earning more than $100 per gig. Location influences freelance web designers’ rates — those in the U.K. can earn an average of $220.15 per day, $405 per day in the Netherlands, and an estimated $350 per day in Italy. According to the London School of Economics, project-based side hustles contribute to around 73% of the estimated $184 billion economic output generated by U.K.-based freelancers. This figure surpasses that of designers engaging in repetitive tasks or gigs for a single client. Design roles account for 50% of the 20 highest-earning side hustles for a single day's work. Marketing strategy is one of the highest-paid side hustles in the United States, with an average pay of $178.08 daily. An influential strategist’s contributions include increased brand visibility, generating new customers, increasing revenue, and nurturing existing client relationships. Companies looking to engage with marketing experts aim to reap profitable returns on their marketing investments, which can influence the consultant's fee structure. Freelancing writing gigs, like resume construction, seem commonplace, but those with more social media savvy can lean into their skillset by pursuing professional profile creation. LinkedIn profile writing has proven a lucrative niche, with contributors scoring about $110 daily. Though making a social media profile seems simple, skillful execution requires freelancers to understand various industries and ensure that contents cater to a client’s potential employers or target audience. LinkedIn profile creation also demands the incorporation of text that withstands the stringency of many employers’ AI recruitment tools. Much like a resume, a LinkedIn profile serves as a sales pitch, establishing the client's skills, experience, and personality while addressing the criteria sought by recruiters. Internet content growth and millions of new business applications currently drive designer demand, with presentation design standing out as one of the highest-paying roles — up to $168 daily. Pitch decks are presentations for prospective investors that guide them through a company’s vision, offer, and market potential. These are often arranged as PowerPoint or Apple Keynote presentations and must be striking and informative. The freelancer will work with the hiring company to produce the cards, but some clients may expect the designer to advise on the structure of the pitch itself. For this reason, it is essential that the freelancer clearly expresses their offerings and skill set. Designers can expect to make more as they hone and develop their skills. Data dashboards are digital interfaces arranged like car dashboards, depicting valuable data and processes in real-time. These require patient and technical side hustlers, as these data-driven pieces often require more time than other gigs. Whether designing a data dashboard from scratch or entering and processing data on an existing system, freelancers can average $120.86 per day. Such tech may intimidate professionals outside of the industry, so bringing in a freelancer can help explain the lay of the land. “Often, if they have some data and they think they can do something interesting or of value with it — rather than hiring a data scientist — it makes more sense to bring in someone for a few weeks or a month to explore the data, understand the business challenges and opportunities and what’s feasible,” explains Matt Johnson , former COO of data science consultancy Data Mettle. One of the most lucrative side hustles in the U.S. is creating AI spokesperson videos. They pay an average of $131 per job. Several services offer the ability to use AI tools to create virtual video avatars. Similar to what you'd find in a video game, you can animate the AI characters and have them say or do just about anything. However, it's not as easy as just plugging in the words for the virtual narrator to \"read.\" Recruiters pay reasonable rates for freelancers to not only create but edit together the video so it doesn't look generic but really represents the client that needs the video. You can sign up for various services that offer the AI spokesperson creation interface, but be sure to factor in the cost of that service when charging the client, especially if it requires a periodic subscription to maintain. Engaging in a side hustle can be a strategic move for individuals looking to leverage underutilized skills or expertise while supplementing their income and enhancing their overall professional performance. By dedicating a few hours a week to a side hustle, individuals can bolster their financial stability and gain valuable experience and insights that may benefit their primary job. However, selecting the right side hustle is crucial; it should be a service that aligns with your strengths and abilities while offering lucrative compensation. This ensures that your time and effort yield maximum financial and professional returns. Success! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

        "content": "The rivalry between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg may be heating up again. Musk's xAI is reportedly vying with Meta to partner with Character.AI , an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup that allows users to create AI-generated characters that act as chatbots, individuals with knowledge of the situation told the Financial Times . According to the report, both companies have held exploratory talks with Character.AI about working together on initiatives, including pre-training and developing AI models, although no deal has been struck with either. Character.AI, which allows users to create their own personalized chatbots, was valued at $1 billion last year and is in talks to raise around $200 million from investors including Google. The race between Meta and xAI to partner with Character.AI marks the latest development in the fierce rivalry between Musk and Zuckerberg. The two billionaires have been publicly feuding since 2016 , when a SpaceX rocket exploded and destroyed a Facebook satellite. Related stories The grudge nearly turned physical in 2023 , when Musk challenged jiu-jitsu champion Zuckerberg to a cage match. To date, the fight hasn't happened, but that hasn't stopped Musk from continuing to goad his rival on X . AI seems like it will be the latest theater for their rivalry. Meta and xAI, which Musk founded last year , are racing to build up their AI infrastructure and fighting each other for talent . XAI announced it had raised $6 billion in funding on Monday , and is reportedly planning to build a \"gigafactory of compute,\" an enormous supercomputer that will be used to train the latest version of its sarcastic and foul-mouthed Grok chatbot . Meta, meanwhile, has added AI features to its social media platforms, including Character.AI-style celebrity personas . Zuckerberg has vowed to spend \"aggressively\" on AI and said that the company's mission is now to build AGI , a level of AI that will outperform humans. The two billionaires have clashed over AI before. In 2017, Zuckerberg branded Musk's views on AI as \" irresponsible \" after Musk questioned whether AI could be a threat to humanity. \"With AI especially, I'm really optimistic, and I think that people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios ... I don't understand it. It's really negative, and in some ways, I actually think it's pretty irresponsible,\" Zuckerberg said. Musk fired back that the Meta boss had a \"limited\" understanding of the subject. Meta, Elon Musk, and Character.AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment made outside normal working hours.",

        "content": "The UN Security Council would convene Tuesday for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. (UN) The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting Tuesday over an Israeli strike that killed dozens in a displaced persons camp in Rafah, as three European countries were slated to formally recognize a Palestinian state, reports AFP. AFP journalists on the ground early Tuesday reported fresh Israeli strikes overnight in the southern Gaza border city, where an Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement center, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials. The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre.\" Israel said it was looking into the \"tragic accident.\" \"There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres posted on social media. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths pointed to the widespread warnings of civilian deaths that circulated ahead of Israel's incursion into Rafah, saying in a statement: \"We've seen the consequences in last night's utterly unacceptable attack.\" \"To call it 'a mistake' is a message that means nothing for those killed, those grieving, and those trying to save lives,\" he added. Diplomats said the UN Security Council would convene Tuesday for an emergency session called by Algeria to discuss the attack. The EU's foreign policy chief said he was \"horrified by news\" of the strike, while French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged,\" and a US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.\" The Israeli military said it was launching a probe. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told parliament the deaths occurred \"despite our best efforts\" to protect civilians. The outcry over the strike came as Spain, Ireland and Norway were set to formally recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a decision slammed by Israel as a \"reward\" for Hamas. \"Recognising the state of Palestine is about justice for the Palestinian people,\" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Monday in Brussels. It was also \"the best guarantee of security for Israel and absolutely essential for reaching peace in the region,\" he said alongside his Irish and Norwegian counterparts. On Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had told Spain's consulate in Jerusalem to stop offering consular services to West Bank Palestinians from June 1 as a \"preliminary punitive\" measure. The top world court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday ordered Israel to halt any offensive in Rafah and elsewhere that could bring about \"the physical destruction\" of the Palestinians. The war in Gaza started after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, which has been central to aid operations in the besieged territory during the war, said on social media platform X that \"with every day passing, providing assistance & protection becomes nearly impossible.\" \"The images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth,\" he said.",

        "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the cofounder of other major companies, including SpaceX. He was born in 1971 in South Africa. Musk's parents are Maye and Errol, who divorced in 1979. In the 1990s, he founded his first startup, Zip2, with his brother, Kimbal, and began a decadeslong career in tech. Musk's second venture, online banking company X.com, merged with a startup of Peter Thiel's to form PayPal. When PayPal sold to eBay in 2002, Musk made $165 million. Musk is the third richest person in the world. He's frequently trading places with other billionaires in the ranks, but as of May 2024, Musk's net worth stands at $191 billion, putting him behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault. His estimated fortune peaked at around $340 billion in November 2021 as Tesla shares soared. Elon Musk started buying shares in Twitter, now called X, in January 2022 and initiated an acquisition in April that year. By the time Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, he had actually spent months trying to back out of the agreement. At the start of July, he sent a letter to Twitter purporting to terminate the acquisition. Twitter promptly sued him. When the sale went through, Musk immediately ousted a number of Twitter executives, including its CEO, CFO, and chief legal officer. In November, Musk issued an ultimatum: work at an \"extremely hardcore\" rate or accept a three-month severance package. He would go on to lay off around 80% of Twitter's staff. Musk's Twitter verification changes were announced on November 1. He tweeted that Twitter's \"current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit.\" He added, \"Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.\" In May 2023, Musk named Linda Yaccarino as Twitter's new CEO. \"Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app,\" Musk said in a tweet. In July 2023, Twitter was rebranded to X. Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, investing $100 million he made from the sale of PayPal. The company nearly failed. After three unsuccessful launches between 2006 and 2008, funding was running out. Then, on September 28, 2008, SpaceX became the first private company to achieve a successful orbital launch. That same year, SpaceX received a $1.5 billion NASA contract. \"Fate liked us that day,\" Musk told CNBC when reflecting on the events nine years later. SpaceX launches now happen on a fairly regular basis. The company publishes a SpaceX launch schedule on its website. Launches typically take place at Cape Canaveral Space Force Base or the Kennedy Space Center, which are both in Florida. SpaceX runs the Starlink satellite internet system. Its satellites operate in Earth's lower orbit, decreasing the lag between when the data is transferred to the receiver, according to the company. Musk said he plans to eventually create a constellation of up to 42,000 satellites. The company launched its first batch of Starlink satellites in 2019 and has more than 4,000 of its satellites in orbit today. Related stories The SpaceX Falcon 9, a partially reusable two-stage rocket, is often used for launches. The Falcon 9 family of rockets is a first-of-its-kind and a key asset for NASA in servicing the International Space Station since the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Apart from the Space Shuttles, the majority of spacefaring equipment was previously single-use. SpaceX is valued at almost $140 billion under Musk's unique leadership style. Because it's a private company, SpaceX stock is not easy to purchase for members of the general public. The company is not currently publicly planning an IPO. Musk has said that SpaceX won't file for an initial public offering until what he calls the \"Mars Colonial Transporter\" is flying regularly. SpaceX's long-term goal is to make colonizing Mars affordable. Musk's The Boring Company was created as a subsidiary of SpaceX and later became its own entity. Inspired by LA traffic gridlock, the tunneling venture has several ongoing projects on the West Coast. In April 2022, The Boring Company completed Series C funding of $675 million, which was valued at $5.675 billion, according to a Boring Company news release. Boring Company stock is not currently publicly traded. In 2018, Musk sold 20,000 Boring Company flamethrowers in just five days. The product, called \"Not-A-Flamethrower,\" has been off the market for years. However, it's acquired something of a cult status among the tech mogul's fans, and some people have been paying hundreds of dollars to snap them up on eBay. Among Musk's other innovative products is a 5'8\" humanoid Tesla robot named Optimus, announced in 2021. The robot is designed to help reduce the labor shortage, according to Musk, and keep workers safer. This could very well be groundbreaking, but it still has a long way to go before it is ready for production and available for purchase. Musk's brain-chip company Neuralink has begun implanting its devices in human skulls — and like many of Musk's ventures, the new technology has been met with both fanfare and skepticism. Neuralink's current priority is to treat patients with neurological conditions, such as paralysis and blindness. Initially, in the first human trial, Neuralink's goal is to help patients with paralyzed limbs control devices like a computer mouse or keyboard with only their thoughts. But Musk has said he wants Neuralink to ultimately help humans achieve \"symbiosis\" with artificial intelligence so that they don't get \"left behind\" as AI evolves over time. Musk founded startup xAI in March 2023, which has since launched a chatbot called Grok. In May 2024, xAI announced it had raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round. The billionaire wants xAI to build a supercomputer and have it running by fall 2025, The Information reported. It will be powered by Nvidia's GPUs. Musk's spouses are Justine Musk, who he met at Queen's University in Ontario, Canada, and Talulah Riley, whom he married in 2010. He met Riley at a bar in London, and the couple divorced and remarried before splitting again. Five of Musk's children were born during his eight-year marriage with his ex-wife, Justine. It is unclear if Musk is dating anyone presently. Musk reportedly split in 2022 with actor Natasha Bassett, who is believed to be his last public girlfriend. Before that, Musk briefly dated actor Amber Heard in 2017 amid her divorce from actor Johnny Depp. The two first connected on the red carpet of the 2016 Met Gala, which Depp was expected to attend but didn't. He and the musician Grimes started dating in 2018. Since then, they've broken up and gotten back together a few times. Now, they appear to just be co-parents of a boy and a girl named X Æ A-Xii and Y. Musk quietly had twins in November 2021 with one of his top executives, Shivon Zilis.",

Only #Yuva5G ’s Processor with 360K+ AnTuTu Score could do the job! 😎 Launching on 30th May, 12PM #LavaMobiles #ProudlyIndian pic.twitter.com/OlgXITCx4z — Lava Mobiles (@LavaMobile) May 28, 2024 As you may have guessed from the 50MP camera teaser, the Lava Yuva 5G will focus on photography, at least as much as it is possible on a budget. There is a second lens on the back, though its function is unclear. On the front, there is an 8MP selfie camera inside a punch hole. Shoot your shot, or shoot your ‘shot’? With #Yuva5G , you can do both!😉 Launching on 30th May, 12PM #LavaMobiles #ProudlyIndian pic.twitter.com/xo7de7GHta — Lava Mobiles (@LavaMobile) May 27, 2024 This will be the first 5G-capable Yuva phone, which is Lava’s affordable series. Previously, there have been 5G models in the Blaze, Agni and Storm series, all of which have relied on various Dimensity chips. The most recent entry in the Yuva series is the Lava Yuva 3 with a 4G-only Unisoc T606 chip and a 13MP rear + 5MP front camera setup, so a much more basic device than the upcoming 5G model. To be fair, the Yuva 3 launched at ₹6,800 ($82), so basic specs are to be expected. Source",

        "content": "Europe could be doing a “hell of a lot more” in bringing about a ceasefire in Gaza and on sanctioning Israel, the Irish premier has said. Simon Harris made the comments on the day that Ireland is to formally recognise a Palestinian state in a joint move with Norway and Spain. The Palestinian flag has been flown at the home of the Irish Parliament, Leinster House, and four hours have been set aside in the Irish parliament’s lower chamber to hear TDs’ statements. Speaking as he arrived for the Cabinet meeting where the Government will agree to the formal recognition, the Taoiseach said the European Union has the power to sanction Israel but that it needs to do more to bring an end to the violence. “Europe could be doing a hell of a lot more and Europe needs to do a lot more in relation to this,” the Fine Gael leader said. It comes as EU foreign ministers engage in significant discussions this week on sanctioning Israel if it fails to comply with international humanitarian law. “We have an association agreement that is effectively a trade benefit agreement between Europe and Israel, and I am very confident that the overwhelming majority of people in this country would like to see that agreement reviewed from a human rights point of view,” Mr Harris added. He described the decision to recognise the Palestinian state as “historic and important”. “This is an important moment and I think it sends a signal to the world that there are practical actions you can take as a country to help keep the hope and destination of a two-state solution alive at a time when others are trying to sadly bomb it into oblivion,” he said. “I am conscious though, as we take this historic and important decision today, of the ongoing human catastrophe unfolding in the Middle East, in Gaza, in Rafah. I am conscious of the devastation being caused by people being deprived of food, starvation, and hunger being used as a weapon of war. “Unfortunately we now have a new despicable and disgusting trend emerging where, every now and again, in particular when absolute horror seems to take place, the Prime Minister of Israel (Benjamin Netanyahu) comes out and describes it as a ‘tragic mistake’. “April’s ‘tragic mistake’ was the bombing to death of aid workers trying to provide food to starving mouths, May’s ‘tragic mistake’, yesterday, was children being blown to death while seeking protection in a displaced centre. “What will June’s ‘tragic mistake’ be? And more importantly what does the world now intend to stop it happening? “For many weeks I have consistently been making the point at every meeting I have been at, including the European Council meeting, and my meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, and in many conversations with European prime ministers, that we need to use every lever at our disposal to bring about a ceasefire and to stop the violence.” Ireland will recognise a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders, the culmination of months of diplomatic work that began in December. The Palestinian Mission in Ireland is to be upgraded to an embassy and a Palestinian ambassador to Ireland will be appointed. Ireland will upgrade its Representative Office of Ireland in Ramallah to an embassy, and redesignate the Irish Representative to Palestine as the Ambassador of Ireland to the State of Palestine. Mr Harris said he hopes the move will encourage other EU member states to take the same step. He said other European countries are considering recognising the Palestinian state. “I would really encourage them to do because we must know create momentum towards peace and cessation of violence,” he added. Earlier this week, Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich claimed Ireland’s move to recognise a Palestinian state is worrying Israeli investors in the Irish IT services sector. Irish deputy premier Micheal Martin said the idea that recognising the state of Palestine is anti-Israel is “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense to make that accusation or that assertion,” he said on Tuesday. “The reason why more European Union states are coming to the recognition question is because of clear evidence that the Israeli government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, has sought to undermine the concept of a two-state solution which everybody, a decade ago, had agreed with. “Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is against that, and people are running out of patience in that respect and we are not going to allow the viability and prospect of a two-state solution to be ended just by the Israeli government’s intransigence.” Mr Martin also said that he expected more EU member states to recognise the state of Palestine “in the coming while”. He added: “I think the decision by Ireland, Norway and Spain has been a catalyst for others to consider their position.” “This decision has given a beacon of hope to the Palestinian people.” —Taoiseach @SimonHarrisTD pic.twitter.com/fHqID22Gc7 — Fine Gael (@FineGael) May 22, 2024 The current ambassador in Dublin, Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, said the move “gives hope” and it is “the right time” to recognise a Palestinian state. “I am looking forward to seeing the flag flying on Leinster House. It’s a big moment,” she said. Israel’s foreign affairs minister, Israel Katz, reacted to the planned recognition by issuing a “severe demarche” to the Irish, Spanish and Norwegian ambassadors to Israel. Mr Harris previously criticised Israel’s treatment of Ireland’s ambassador, Sonya McGuinness, who was shown footage in front of Israeli media in a manner said to be “outside the norm” of how diplomats are treated.",

        "content": "Several trade unions are outraged by outgoing Infrastructure Minister Mark Harbers’ plan to and ban loud planes at night. They call the plans and his way of implementing them undemocratic and ill-considered, the Telegraaf . Renier Castelein of De Unie told the newspaper that there is no democratic mandate for the latest proposals. “The Netherlands is becoming an unpredictable and unreliable destination. Copenhagen and Lisbon are going to grow as a result. Retaliatory measures from China, Qatar, and the U.S. will damage the communications network. This affects the business climate, the labor market, the flower auction, the hotel and conference sector, and the industry that wants reliable transport for machines and parts.” The Dutch Airline Pilots Association (VNV) thinks the Minister did not properly study the long-term consequences of this plan. “We endorse the importance of reducing noise for locals, but at the same time, the government continues to impose instead of consult. While it has already been shown in recent years that this leads to a legal quagmire. Only together can we ensure that noise gains are achieved,” said spokesman Camiel Verhagen. The Dutch Union of Aviation Technicians is surprised that a Minister from the VVD - a party that prides itself on its commitment to entrepreneurs - is pushing through these plans. According to leader Piet Visser, the money for sustainability must first be earned. “We do not understand why the VVD lets this Minister run around like an elephant in the china shop. We hope the VVD will come to its senses again and realize that a stable policy is necessary for an enterprising Netherlands.” The Dutch Cabin Crew Union thinks the Minister should consider the sector’s own plans, which, according to the union, achieve noise reduction by slowing planes down a bit. According to leader Chris van Elswijk, knowledge institutes like TNO and TU Delft also support the plan.",

Final figures will be available on Wednesday. The audience peaked at 6.46 million viewers from 7:30-7:45pm ET as Josef Newgarden outdueled Pato O’Ward in the final laps. IndyCar reports this is also the most-streamed IndyCar race ever, with an Average Minute Audience (AMA) of 286,000 viewers across Peacock and NBC Sports digital platforms, and is NBC Sports’ most-watched Sunday sports event since the NFL playoffs in January. NBC Sports’ pre-race coverage began at 11am ET, with the green flag originally scheduled for 12:45pm ET. However, severe weather forced a nearly four-hour delay moving NBC Sports’ race window from 4:45-8:15pm. NBC filled the rain-delayed hours with periodic live updates and an encore presentation of the 2023 race, resulting in more than nine hours of broadcast network coverage for the entire day. IndyCar removed the local blackout in Indianapolis, which delivered an 18.15 household rating and 54 share. Through six races, the 2024 NTT IndyCar Series is averaging a TAD of 1.95 million viewers (5 on NBC; 1 on USA Network), up from 1.94m last year at the same point (all NBC). Total Audience Delivery (TAD) is based upon live-plus-same day fast national figures from Nielsen and digital data from Adobe Analytics.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is set to defy a family vow by stepping into the ring with Jake Paul , a favorite in the Tyson household. The 57 year old former heavyweight champion will face off against the much younger Paul , who is three decades his junior, on July 20 at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys. This bout marks Tyson's return to the ring since his exhibition match with Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020 and his first official fight since losing to Kevin McBride in June 2005 via TKO. Netflix will stream the event live, showcasing Tyson's decision to go back on a promise to his loved ones. On the Full Send Podcast in 2021, when asked if he could knock out Paul, Tyson confidently asserted: \"So ------- easy. Yeah, but I would never. I'd be against my own ------- family. They love this little white ------------ You know what I mean? He got balls. He's got ------- balls. When you see a white boy with balls, you know. I'm talking about for real, but ---- you ------------. Yeah, but nah man, let him have his ------- reign.\" Ahead of the July showdown, Tyson recently faced a health scare due to an ulcer flare-up while flying from Miami to Los Angeles. After landing at LAX, he required immediate medical attention from paramedics.

A statement from his team read: \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great. He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Meanwhile, Tyson is gearing up for a massive comeback event expected to draw over 90,000 fans this summer. \"It's crazy to think about but as many people as can fit in the stadium, I think it's 90,000 or 93,000,\" Tyson shared with TMZ Sports, expressing his anticipation for the packed venue and the potentially massive global viewership. \"I think it's going to be packed to the brim and the global viewership could be in the hundreds of millions. It's wild and it doesn't make any sense but the fact Netflix are part of this is the perfect piece of the puzzle.\" He also had some inspiring words for his younger fans: \"It makes it the perfect trifecta of Netflix's audience, my audience and Mike Tyson's audience. And to the kids at home, [it says] don't listen to the critics. Do you and don't be afraid to knock down the doors of opportunity because you truly never know where it's going to lead you.\" During their press conference, Tyson didn't hold back on his opponent Paul, remarking: \"I don't know if he's in his prime. He's fat. He should be lean and mean. He's fat and funky. I saw him with his shirt off the other day, he's fat. Did you start training already?\"",

        "content": "Looking into the future of the US economy reveals a mixed bag of signals, especially when trying to find the top stocks to buy. On the positive side, job opportunities abound, with many openings surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Hourly wages are rising, outpacing inflation, which means more consumer purchasing power. However, the specter of inflation remains, stubbornly resisting the Federal Reserve’s efforts to meet its targets. This inflationary pressure and consumers’ expectations of further price increases could lead to a cycle of rising prices.

Because of our uncertain economy, its important to find the top stocks to buy. Here are three potential candidates to give your portfolio a boost.

The company’s recent financials show apparent growth, and with its recent innovations for Microsoft, it can show future success, making it one of the top stocks to buy. Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS) Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE: GOOS ) manufactures and distributes products through its stores, both physical and online. Goose’s current price of $13.98 grew 21.14% YTD .

        "content": "Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a leading global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system. (Image courtesy of Nasdaq) NEW YORK, May 28, 2024 (Korea Bizwire) – Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) and FIA Tech today announced they will partner to help reduce the complexity of post trade data processing across the exchange traded derivative market. Nasdaq will integrate its strategic clearing platform, Nasdaq Real-Time Clearing, into FIA Tech’s Trade Data Network. The Trade Data Network combines trade data from buyside, brokers, clearing houses and clearing members into a common framework, creating a shared golden source of clearing activity for participating firms. Integrating Nasdaq’s clearing platform will reduce friction and significantly enhance the volume and quality of post trade data available to FIA Tech’s 8,000+ members, while empowering central counterparty clearinghouses (CCPs) using Nasdaq’s clearing platform and end-users with the ability to conduct more reliable risk analysis, operate with greater capital efficiency, and lower overall risk exposure. Ultimately, the industry-leading functionality will help to substantially reduce systemic inefficiency across the global post trade network. Built over decades in a series of silos, much of the global post trade network is highly fragmented with a high degree of non-standardized data exchanged between market participants and infrastructure providers. This has led to a sector characterized by multiple points of reconciliation where trading data and cleared positions are verified across multiple systems, poor information flow between participants, and instances where data is effectively lost in the network. Collectively, it represents a substantial inefficiency and cost to the industry. It is a particular challenge for the data heavy exchange traded derivatives market during periods of high volumes and volatility, which has historically lacked a standardized approach to addressing reconciliation issues or provision of timely data to end clients. Inconsistent standards, a lack of common trade identifiers, and inadequate tools for collaborating and communicating across the industry prevent a coherent flow of data and timely resolution. Through the Trade Data Network, FIA Tech provides market participants and post trade service providers with the tools to improve middle and back-office processes including trade-date clearing, give-ups, fee and commissions management, and helps to eliminate duplicative reconciliations across these functions. Magnus Haglind, Senior Vice President and Head of Products, Marketplace Technology, Nasdaq, said: “As a technology provider to over 20 CCPs globally, Nasdaq has a powerful role to play in addressing systemic inefficiency across the global post trade network. There is a global necessity to upgrade legacy post trade technology platforms, and interoperability must sit at the heart of the new global framework. A consistent operating model for data, systems and processes can deliver substantial benefits to market participants through more efficient use of capital and a more resilient operating model.” Nick Solinger, President and CEO, FIA Tech, said: “Nasdaq’s integration of its strategic Real-Time Clearing system into the Trade Data Network will increase standardization and network adoption. We are excited to partner with Nasdaq on this initiative to reduce operational inefficiencies.” Nasdaq’s Financial Technology division provides mission-critical capital markets and regulatory technology solutions to the financial services industry. As a scaled platform partner, Nasdaq draws on deep industry experience and technology expertise to help 3,500+ banks, brokers, regulators, infrastructure operators, and buy-side firms solve their toughest operational challenges while advancing industrywide modernization.

The game is reportedly \"medieval-inspired,\" titled Doom: The Dark Ages, and potentially not be finding a spot on our list of upcoming Xbox exclusive games — Doom: The Dark Ages is said to be a multiplatform game , launching on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Doom: The Dark Ages reportedly launching on PlayStation As first reported by Insider Gaming , Doom: The Dark Ages has been in development for \"at least four years\" and could be revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase next month. Leaked Microsoft plans during the Activision Blizzard acquisition suggested that Bethesda was working on a new Doom entry codenamed Doom Year Zero, potentially meaning this could be a prequel for the franchise — Insider Gaming says it's set in a \"medieval-inspired doom world.\" Following Insider Gaming's report, industry insider NateTheHate backed up the claim on X, adding that Doom: The Dark Ages will be revealed as a multiplatform game, as Microsoft reportedly plans to launch it on PlayStation alongside Xbox and PC. Windows Central 's Jez Corden has also corroborated the reports. Corden has reportedly also heard that Doom: The Dark Ages will be revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase and is slated to launch on PlayStation, \"potentially day and date.\" Back in February, Microsoft announced that four Xbox exclusives would launch on PlayStation and Nintendo. Reports earlier this month suggested that Microsoft is eyeing up more games to launch on other platforms , and it looks like we could see some announcements during the Xbox Showcase next month.",

        "description": "Night Wanderer is the next Pokemon TCG expansion set on the horizon and the reveals are already going down well with Pokemon collectors.",
        "content": "is the next upcoming Pokemon TCG expansion set and the card reveals have been slowly but steadily making their way out into the community. This expansion set drops on , closely following the expansion release. Alongside reveals and the evolution chain, one card that’s gone down immensely well with the community is Zorua (072/064). This Art Rare was illustrated by the artist REND, who has been gradually building up a cult following in the community. Officially revealed on the Japanese Pokemon TCG YouTube channel, the card features napping on the edge of a building. The artwork is strikingly different to the majority of recent Pokemon card reveals, and it’s one to watch as a collector – the cards with this art style already hold some value. Pokemon TCG collectors were hyped about the Zorua reveal, with one person saying, “And people are still like “vintage cards have best artworks!” Definitely not. This card is amazing.” Another agreed, saying that some vintage cards were great but that cards like this were “amazing and adorable”. Another viewer chimed in with their thoughts, saying, “My Zoroark line collection is going to become a lot cuter! Such a sleepy little guy.” Others simply dubbed the card “eepy” Zorua. One Pokemon fan shared their love for the artist who illustrated this card, declaring, “REND is one of the new artists that I really love. Most of their art has that photographic depth of field effect, which looks so good in drawn art. Love it. I’m collecting all of REND’s cards right now.” Others were curious about whether this reveal indicated a new Zoroark ex card. A Zoroark card has been revealed already, but it’s not an ex card. It’s hard to say with certainty at the time of writing as a full card list is not available, but it’s possible we could get a new Zoroark ex in the set after Night Wanderer. , it’s safe to say that there is some competitive viability with these cards. Zorua isn’t particularly heavy-hitting, but with 70HP it could work as an early-game starter. Zoroark, however, has an Attack that can deal 110 damage right off the bat. Related: Alongside this, Zoroark has the Attack Phantom Jack. When used, this card does 60 damage for each of the opponent’s ex and V Pokemon in play. Some fans in the PokeBeach forums were confused by the wording here, querying why the card didn’t just reference all Rule Box ‘mons instead of ex and V Pokemon. One commenter pointed out that, “they don’t want it to count Radiant Pokemon for some reason”. Another fan theorized, “I think it’s an anti-power creep effort. Except for Ability locking effects (all of which are noticeably weaker than ones that already exist in Expanded), they’ve consistently chosen the phrasing that makes the card weaker.” These are both fair points – are still popular in the competitive circuit, especially Radiant . The latest Pokemon card expansion sets do seem to be encouraging Stall and Control decks, and they’re leaning towards cards that aren’t tanky in a lot of cases. It’s a period of change for the TCG. As we get closer to the release date, we’re sure to see more card reveals for Night Wanderer, so check back for further updates and card breakdowns. It’ll be interesting to see whether this duo of cards gets any play in the competitive circuit and how people choose to use it in their decks.",

In an open letter announcing her decision to quit as Junior Common Room (JCR) Vice-President at St Hugh’s College, Madeline Bryant, wrote that she would not work for a committee that had 'treated me so cruelly.' She said that 'as a Jewish student, I aimed to explain my own experiences of antisemitism', but that the meeting descended into an 'insult to social justice and a win for antisemites everywhere'. 'Last night, the JCR refused to live up to the values and the community it ought to serve. 'It is a stain on this college’s history and it should be a stain on your consciences. St. Hugh’s College has an antisemitism problem', the letter, reproduced by student newspaper Cherwell, said. Madeline Bryant (pictured) wrote her resignation letter after a 'three-hour' college meeting that she claims saw other members disregard her experiences as a Jewish student Ms Bryant quit her JCR position at St Hugh’s College (pictured) over allegations of 'anti-semitism' Pro-Palestine protesters at a recent encampment protest in Oxford. Pictured: May 23 A protester walks during a demonstration in support of Palestinians at Oxford University Protesters stand in front of a university building during one campus demonstration at Oxford University JCRs represent the undergraduates in Oxford colleges, and as well as organising social events, often also engage in thorny political issues. According to her account of the meeting, a motion 'asking for the basic principle of equal treatment and peace' was 'effectively thrown out' by the student body, while a motion favoured by radical pro-Gaza protesters at the university was allowed to proceed to a full vote. Read More EXCLUSIVE Swastikas found carved into toilet doors at Oxford college: Principal slams 'deeply shocking' anti-Semitic graffiti found amid pro-Palestinian protests at university This motion ' defames and delegitimises the Jewish people. It denies our ties to our ancestral homeland, dehumanises Israeli academics and students, and neglects to call out the actions of terrorists', Miss Bryant wrote. Explaining her wider experiences, she wrote about seeing 'my peers at this university chant to \"Globalise the Intifada\" – a call for violence against Jews' and also highlighted how she had warned at the stormy meeting that the college's Hebrew language program would be at risk if the university cuts ties with Israel, as is being urged by Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P). She said that ' the response I received was \"So what?\" with a smile'. The row follows swastika graffiti being found in another Oxford college, which was also linked by some to JCR politics, soon after pro-Gaza protesters at the elite university clashed with police. Sir Malcolm Evans, who leads Regent’s Park College, told students 'appropriate action will be taken should we become aware of the identity of those responsible'. The Nazi symbols were found on the walls of two toilet cubicles next to the college's Hall - its dining room - leaving Jewish students 'deeply upset'. Her proposal for 'equal treatment and peace' was 'effectively thrown out' by other students Students said they were 'punched in the face' as the protest was broken up Protesters outside waving flags during the attempted occupation of an Oxford admin office Police arrested Oxford students trying to occupy a university building In recent days, Oxford students tried and failed to occupy a building in their latest demonstration against Israel 's war in Gaza , leading to 16 being arrested. Oxford Action for Palestine, which is behind tent encampments attempting to mimic the radical pro-Palestine protests seen on US campuses, said the university had 'enabled an unprecedented level of violence against students' following the clash. Furious members of the group posted a video on social media on Saturday, accusing a security guard of 'slamming the door on the heads of students protesting the university's complicity in genocide'. In fact, the video showed the member of staff weakly prodding them with his foot as he tries to access a door that they are obstructing. University chiefs were already summoned to Downing Street earlier this month to discuss the 'unacceptable' rise of antisemitism at universities and the need for campuses to be 'safe' for Jewish students.

The bargain retailer's deal includes a traditional main, side and drink, with more than 400 items to choose from in its range which will be rolled out across UK stores within weeks. Its £3 price tag comes in 40p cheaper than a Tesco meal deal using its Clubcard, and 50p cheaper than Sainsbury's equivalent. It also clocks in at 50p cheaper than Coop's meal deal, which is £3.50 for members (and £4 for non members), as well as being less pricey than Boots' option, which costs £3.99 (or £4.99 in its London and Airport outlets). For their main, Poundland shoppers can pick between sandwiches, wraps, salads, sushi and rolls, with sandwich options including ham and cheese, chicken and bacon and tuna salad. Poundland are introducing a £3 meal deal, including a main, side and drink, to all 850 stores in the coming weeks Sides include pastries, chocolate bars, crisps, fruit and meat trays, while there are around 200 drinks available across different stores. There are more than 400 items on the offer across mains, sides and drinks The deal comes in 40p cheaper than Tesco's equivalent, even when shoppers at the supermarket use their Clubcard Poundland's managing director Austin Cooke told The Sun his shop's deal is 'the best value in the land'. He added: 'We're 20 per cent cheaper than the next competitor, and that is with a loyalty card.'

Poundland's sandwiches come from the same manufacturer as M&S. The £3 meal deal and new product range will be hitting all 850 Poundland stores in the coming weeks. It comes after Tesco customers expressed their fury at their slightly more expensive meal deal now classing fruit pots as a main rather than a side. When MailOnline contacted Tesco for comment, a spokesperson said: 'We're always looking for ways to expand, improve, and update our meal deal offering depending on the evolving tastes of our customers. 'Over a year ago, we introduced some larger fruit pots (between 230-300g) as a main option in response to customers telling us they would like more mains that are suitable for breakfast. 'Our smaller fruit pots (between 80-145g) are all still classed as snacks in our meal deals. 'Across our large stores, customers can choose from more than 10 million meal deal combinations and in Express stores there are still more than 4 million possible meal deal combinations. 'This huge choice means there are options for most tastes and dietary requirements.'

He is also 51 runs short of becoming the all-time leading run-scorer in T20Is, going past Kohli, who currently has 4037 runs to his name. After the opening T20I in Leeds was called off, Pakistan lost the second match at Edgbaston in Birmingham by 23 runs. Babar scored 32 runs off 26 balls with 4 fours before Moeen Ali accounted for his wicket. Chasing a stiff target of 184, Pakistan were bowled out for 160 in 19.2 overs. Babar has a huge task in hand as after the series against England, Pakistan will take part in the T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and the West Indies.",

Born in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, Javid moved to the United States in 1982 and has since built a thriving career based on community service, entrepreneurship, and healthcare. After earning a Doctor of Pharmacy from the University of the Pacific and serving as the Director of Pharmacy at Kindred Healthcare for nearly 19 years, Javid took a transformative step into entrepreneurship. He acquired a small grocery store initially serving the Persian community in San Diego's Clairemont area. With a vision to cater to a broader demographic, Javid expanded the store's inventory to include a diverse range of international products, which significantly grew its customer base. Under Javid's leadership, the business has grown to include a restaurant and catering service, creating a comprehensive community hub. \"My journey into the business world began with my roots in pharmacy, but it soon evolved as I saw the potential to serve the diverse needs of our community through additional services,\" Javid explained. Javid emphasized that his businesses thrive on a model of community engagement and word-of-mouth, eschewing traditional advertising for grassroots efforts and deep community ties. This strategy not only solidifies customer loyalty but also continuously attracts new patrons seeking a personalized shopping experience. When asked about the most rewarding aspect of his work, Javid responded, \"The most fulfilling part is seeing the tangible impact on the community-whether it's helping a patient understand their medication or witnessing the joy of customers finding a piece of their homeland in our store. These moments are profoundly gratifying.\" The future looks bright for the industries Javid is involved in, with advancements in digital technology and a shift towards more personalized services. \"I'm particularly excited about integrating these technological advancements to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency,\" he remarked. For those aspiring to enter the fields of pharmacy or retail, Javid advises, \"Gain a solid educational foundation, seek hands-on experience, and never stop learning. Networking and adapting to industry changes are key.\" Javid is also open to mentoring emerging professionals in the pharmacy and retail sectors. He can be reached through his professional networking profile on LinkedIn or via his personal business website for those interested in guidance or collaboration.

        "content": "Rome is often regarded as one of the world's most beautiful cities - and it's easy to see why. The Italian capital is steeped in history, with stunning architecture on virtually every corner. The historical centre of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and includes major monuments such as the the Pantheon and Trajan's Column. on Monday, June 24-Friday, June 28. recently rated Rome as one of the world's best cities, coming in at ninth on the list after Tokyo. Time Out said: \"Regarded as one of the world’s most beautiful cities, Rome lures travellers with its ancient history, fabled cuisine and laid-back lifestyle. From the majestic Colosseum and intricately carved Trevi Fountain to the Spanish Steps and Pantheon, the city’s architectural splendours provide a theatrical backdrop for daily life. \"Locals still shop for fresh produce in cobblestone piazzas while nuns gather over coffee and schoolchildren visit iconic artworks in the city’s many museums.\" Rome has more fountains than any other city in the world, with 2,000 dotted around the city. The Trevi Fountain is the most well known fountain in the Italian capital, and is every bit as beautiful as you can imagine. The Baroque masterpiece took 30 years to complete. Thousands of coins are tossed into the fountain each week as people make a wish. The coins are eventually fished out and donated to charity. Rome has a number of vantage points that offer stunning views across the city. Gianicolo is located above Trastevere and is the highest point in Rome. Trastevere itself is a great neighbourhood, filled with bars and restaurants. Pasta, pizza and gelato are a must when visiting the city. If you want to experience life as a local, head to Testaccio market which has 100 different stalls to choose from. Vatican City is located within Rome's historic centre but is classed as the smallest country in the world. The Vatican Museums house one of the largest and most important art collections in the world, including the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. The Sistine Chapel is the pope's official residence in Vatican City. The Colosseum is one of the most famous buildings in the world and a trip to Rome wouldn't be complete without visiting it. Built between 72-80 AD, it is the largest amphitheatre in the world and could hold up to 80,000 people. Head up to the fifth floor to take in the amphitheatre in all its glory. You can buy tickets in advance to avoid the queues. The average flight from Liverpool to Rome takes 2 hours and 40 minutes in total. We found a flight from Liverpool to Rome at 9.30am on June 24 and returning at 5.45pm on June 28 for £136. You can find Rome is a city you can travel to all year round and you're likely to get good from March through to October. The city has a Mediterranean climate, with highs of 30 degrees in July and August. If you want to skip to crowds of the summer months, head to Rome in May or October to make the most of the beautiful city.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSemiconductors have become the lifeblood of the digital economy, and these 3 semiconductor stocks to buy on the dip could be lucrative.The post 3 Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on the Dip: May 2024 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Semiconductors are crucial to how the digital economy functions. Smartphones, personal computers, vehicles, telecom networks, and data centers – all of these inputs for our digitized lives rely upon various kinds of silicon. A consumer technology glut that precipitated during the pandemic years had created headwinds for several semiconductor companies (and their share prices). However, last year’s market craze around artificial intelligence ( AI ) has created an uplift in activity in the sector. 2024 is turning out to be a similar story. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen 11.88% from a year-to-date (YTD) perspective, and AI continues to be a major component of that. Even if the rally ceases, investors should be keen to buy up shares of these three semiconductor stocks . Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD ) is a semiconductor giant specializing in the design of sophisticated central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The fabless nature of AMD’s business has helped it rise to become a viable alternative to Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) in terms of CPU power. The next test for this semiconductor firm is its ability to snap up market share in the AI computing market. In 2023, there was a string of announcements regarding AMD’s advanced chips for large language models (LLMs), which would ostensibly compete with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The MI300x accelerators are meant to handle generative AI workloads, and Microsoft has even called the chip “the most cost-effective GPU out there right now for Azure OpenAI.” Moreover, as AMD enters the AI chip market, it will have to compete on costs, just as it did with Intel in the CPU space. If AMD does this successfully, it will become an AI champion. For 2024, AMD shares have only risen 12.29% on a YTD basis, while at one point in early March, the stock price had risen as much as 43.40%. With demand for AI reaching new heights, AMD is a semiconductor stock to buy on the dip. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is less of a household name like AMD or Nvidia. However, the Palo Alto-based semiconductor firm also has an important role to play in the world of artificial intelligence. Broadcom designs a variety of chips for network data processing. As cloud technology has proliferated, demand for Broadcom’s infrastructure technology has risen in turn. Underscoring the firm’s competencies, in April, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) subsidiary, Google, awarded Broadcom two awards for “2024 Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year” for both networking and virtualization. Furthermore, the demand for AI chips has also created new opportunities for Broadcom’s networking products. AI computing results in oceans of data that need to be pushed through a network, and Broadcom’s network chips provide the power to do that efficiently. The company expects to generate around $10 billion in revenue from chips related to artificial intelligence. Broadcom’s share price has risen 25.26% since the start of the year. While trading at only 27.7x forward earnings, AVGO is still among the semiconductor stocks to buy if the market slips again. Nvidia (NVDA) The last entry on this list is AI chip behemoth Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). The chipmaker had risen to prominence years ago due to its innovations in GPU computing technology. Since 2023, enterprises have sought Nvidia’s advanced chips for their ability to power LLMs. The demand for AI chips has caused Nvidia’s GPU sales to balloon. Strong sales and net income growth off the back of AI demand has continued into 2024. Highlights from Nvidia’s first quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2024 are a testament to that. Not only did the chipmaker beat revenue and earnings estimates by a significant margin, but its data center business unit, which is a core piece of the firm’s AI revenue, expanded 427% YOY to $22.6 billion in revenue. Demand for the Hopper graphics processor (H100s) was key to unlocking this unprecedented growth. Nvidia’s stock looks like it will continue to soar in the coming months as it becomes more accessible through a 10-to-1 split. Strong demand for its AI chips across the board is why investors should consider buying more NVDA shares if it dips.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBefore you take a chance on GameStop stock, think carefully about whether GameStop's fundamentals justify a share position right now.The post GameStop Warning: The Meme Stock Bubble That’s Bound to Burst appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Some retail traders are interested in GameStop (NYSE: GME ) but haven’t conducted due diligence on the company, getting caught in the meme trend instead. It’s a trend that could impoverish incautious investors, so we’re sending a warning signal and giving GameStop stock a “D” grade today. You’ve probably heard about the recent short squeeze after a popular Reddit user and meme-stock trader resurfaced on social media after a yearslong break. GameStop stock was pumped and dumped. We don’t want anyone to be the loser in this risky game of musical chairs, so let’s keep it real and do some fact-finding with GameStop now. Don’t Celebrate GameStop’s Capital Raise It’s funny how short-term stock traders can condemn GameStop’s capital raise one day, but then celebrate it another day. It just goes to show that meme-stock traders can be fickle and unpredictable sometimes. On May 17, GameStop stock fell 26% after the company announced its plan to raise capital by selling 45 million shares. Naturally, GameStop’s investors were concerned about the prospect of share-value dilution. “From a corporate perspective, it makes a ton of sense, but it throws some cold water on the recent rally, because now you’re diluting the existing shareholders,” explained Paul Nolte, senior wealth adviser at Murphy & Sylvest. Fast-forward to May 24, and GameStop issued a news release stating that the company had completed this share sale (formally called an “at-the-market equity offering”). Again, the company sold 45 million shares; this wasn’t new news to anyone. The new piece of information was that GameStop had raised “approximately $933.4 million” through this share sale. GameStop stock rallied sharply in after-hours trading, but should anyone really celebrate this news? Investors surely knew ahead of time that it would be a large sum of capital, since 45 million is a lot. None of this reduces the likelihood that GameStop will resort to more large-scale share sales in the future. So, the dilution concerns haven’t gone away and could reemerge at some point. GameStop’s Financials Are Still Faulty Furthermore, investors can’t simply ignore GameStop’s fundamentals. The market’s weighing machine will come into play eventually. Then, GameStop stock could rob shareholders of their wealth. This happened in 2022, 2023 and early 2024, after the original meme-stock rally. Greed isn’t an excuse to overlook the unfortunate ending to the meme-stock rally of 2020 and 2021. It didn’t end well, and we encourage you to look into GameStop’s financials carefully before considering an investment. The overall picture doesn’t look great when we examine GameStop’s preliminary results for the first fiscal quarter, which ended on May 4, 2024. The company expects net sales of $872 million to $892 million, which would represent a steep drop from $1.237 billion in the year-earlier quarter. In addition, GameStop expects a quarterly net earnings loss of $27 million to $37 million. For what it’s worth, this would be an improvement over the net loss of $50.5 million in the year-earlier quarter. This is a reason to give GameStop stock a “D” grade instead of an outright “F” today. That grade might change later on, though. It’s problematic that GameStop remains unprofitable. Along with this, consider that GameStop expects to have ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.073 billion to $1.093 billion. That’s below the $1.31 billion that GameStop had at the end of the year-earlier quarter. Thus, investors can plainly see why GameStop’s management may have felt the need to raise capital by any means necessary. GameStop Stock: Beware the Flash-in-the-Pan Rally It’s exciting, no doubt, to take part in a high-volume meme-stock rally. However, like a game of musical chairs, the rally can end at any moment. If you don’t have very lucky or skillful timing, you could lose a lot of money quickly. We prefer to investigate companies carefully, rather than get involved in flash-in-the-pan trends. GameStop’s capital raise isn’t really something to celebrate, and the company’s financials aren’t ideal. So, buying GameStop stock based on a meme-stock trend is quite risky, and we’re not recommending investing in it today.

        "description": "Council members said they were frustrated with how negotiations played out, as well as the whole budget process.",
        "content": "The budget process for the city’s new fiscal year was the first major challenge for Buffalo’s mayor and the new Common Council seated in January. It was a bumpy ride. Common Council members listen to comments from Gabby Goldstein during a May 15 public hearing on Mayor Byron Brown’s proposed 2024-2025 budget at City Hall. The budget process left a sour taste in the mouths of some lawmakers. On Wednesday night, the Council approved an amended budget to the one Mayor Byron W. Brown proposed. The Council meeting started at 2 p.m. and was recessed for hours as lawmakers and the administration continued negotiations. It finally ended at 8:21 p.m. The deadline was 11:59 p.m. Council members said they were frustrated with how negotiations played out, as well as the whole budget process. Some were displeased about what they said was a lack of communication with the Brown administration earlier in the process. And a few rejected Brown’s request for the Council to adopt a local law allowing the city to exceed the state’s 2% cap on increasing the tax levy. Brown’s request came the day before he was to present his 2024-25 budget recommendations May 1. “This is probably the top three worst budgets that I’ve had to deal with, and I’ve been here when we had Control Board budgets,” North District Council Member Joseph Golombek Jr. said of the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority, which was created in 2003 to oversee the city’s financial operations. “This was pretty bad,” he added. “Hopefully we’re going to learn from this.” Everyone did their work to pass an on-time budget, Brown told a group of reporters Thursday. “The executive proposes a budget. Legislative bodies get a chance to review that budget, then there are negotiations and hopefully the budget gets passed,” he said. “I presented my budget,” Brown added. “If the Council then wants to alter the budget and try to cut things from the budget, that’s the work of the Council to do. We negotiated with the Council. We worked with them, and the budget they passed was based on negotiations.” Ultimately, Brown did not get all he wanted . The Council approved an approximately $616 million budget that lowered the mayor’s proposed tax levy increase from 9% to 7.5%, saving property owners a small amount on their tax bills. The change in the amended tax levy – which is the total amount of taxes collected – means the city will collect $2.38 million less in property taxes than what Brown proposed. Under the amended budget passed by the Council, the owner of a $100,000 home will pay $45 more in taxes in this fiscal year, trimming $33 off the tax hike Brown had proposed. “This was a tough budget, probably the toughest if not one of the two toughest that I’ve had in my time here on the Council,” said Council President Christopher P. Scanlon, who has served on the Council for 12 years representing the South District. He was elected president by his colleagues in January. “For the record, anything that is last minute, trying to be bum rushed in this Council, will never happen again,” said an angry Fillmore Council Member Mitchell P. Nowakowski, who is in his second term. “I wish we had more time,” said Niagara Council Member David A. Rivera, who had been Council majority leader since 2015, but lost the position in January to freshman Council Member Leah Halton-Pope, who represents the Ellicott District. “Instead of negotiating at the last minute, we could have been negotiating a month ago,” he added. “I wish the administration had given this to us months before that.” According to the mayor, “everything went according to schedule.” “We did start communicating before May 1. The Council meets every two weeks. There’s a (Council) finance committee that meets. We answer questions from Council members about the budget. There are reports that go out,” Brown said. Members also were frustrated over Brown’s request late last month for the Council to approve overriding the tax cap. They felt rushed because it was marked for immediate passage, meaning it would bypass public discussion in committee, lawmakers said. The Council had to vote on the request April 30, the day before Brown was to release his budget proposal. “This is a very important decision, and we just moved on it without having any conversation or debate,” said University Council Member Rasheed N.C. Wyatt, a vocal and constant critic of the mayor and his administration, who voted against the tax levy increase. Rivera also voted against overriding the tax cap “simply because it came to us very last minute and we really didn’t have a chance to vet it or to leverage anything we possibly could have gotten by asking for more cuts before approving the override the tax cap.” The main reason Golombek voted against overriding the tax cap was “to protect the taxpayers in my district,” he said. Wyatt was the only member to vote against the amended budget Wednesday night, but due to a procedural error, his dissent was not recorded because no rollcall vote was taken, Scanlon said. Rivera and Golombek voted in favor of the Council’s amended budget because it reduced the tax burden on residents from what Brown proposed, they said. Prior to the vote there was some confusion surrounding the Council’s approval to exceed the tax cap. Lawmakers went into executive session with the city’s corporation counsel, Cavette Chambers, to discuss “the status of the recently passed local law authorizing the City of Buffalo to exceed the New York State property tax cap,” Scanlon said when the Council came back from recess. “I know some people were wondering about the Council going into session with its lawyer, an executive session,” he said. “That is the reason why. We just wanted to make sure every I was dotted and T was crossed pertaining to that local law.” However, the Council did not make a motion on the Council floor to enter into the closed session and did not identify the reason, which seemed to violate New York State’s Open Meetings Law . Scanlon told The Buffalo News Saturday there was nothing improper about the closed session. “As explained to me by corporation counsel, we can meet with our attorney like that,” he said. Brown said all procedures were followed on a timely basis. “I don’t know what the confusion was. Everything was done according to the proper procedure according to the timelines that are specified and laid out, which is why the Council was able to vote on the budget,” he said. Still, this year’s budget process left a sour taste in the mouths of some lawmakers, including Council Member Zeneta B. Everhart, who was elected to her first term representing the Masten District in November. “What has happened in these chambers is nonsense,” Everhart said. “This Council has rubberstamped budgets year after year after year.” “I am angry on behalf of the Masten District residents,” she said.

As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and searching for food DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Over the past three weeks, Israel’s offensive in Rafah has sent nearly a million Palestinians fleeing the southern Gaza city and scattering across a wide area. Most have been displaced multiple times already during Israel’s nearly 8-month-old war in Gaza. With the amount of aid arrivals plummeting, Palestinians have largely been on their own to resettle their families and find the basics of life. Their tent camps stretch for 10 miles along Gaza's coast where families search for food and wood. A schoolteacher living with his wife, children and extended family in a tent says they have nothing and it's destroying them mentally. Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a 'tragic mishap' TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a “tragic mishap” was made in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Spain and Norway formally recognize a Palestinian state as EU rift with Israel widens BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway have moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived Monday with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” At least 22 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 22 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. In Trump's hush money trial, prosecutors and defense lawyers are poised to make final pitch to jury NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments. Each side wants to score final points with the jury Tuesday before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes. The arguments are expected to last the entire day. They'll give the attorneys one last chance to address the jury hearing the landmark case. After four weeks of testimony, the lawyers’ arguments set the stage for deliberations in the case charging Trump in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter. The Republican ex-president denies wrongdoing. Voter outreach groups targeted by new laws in several GOP-led states are struggling to do their work WASHINGTON (AP) — Laws passed in several Republican-controlled states after the 2020 presidential election have criminalized much of the work done by voter outreach groups. Advocates are finding it difficult to adapt as they try to register and educate potential voters with just months to go before this year's presidential election. In-person activities have been eliminated or severely cut back, and staffing has been reduced. Voting rights experts say it's another tactic to strip access to the ballot box, especially for minority voters, who mostly benefit from third-party voter registration. What to know about Mexico's historic elections Sunday that will likely put a woman in power MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexicans will vote Sunday in historic elections weighing many of the core issues facing the country including gender, violence and populism. Mexico could elect its first female president. The election is also the biggest in the country's history with more than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs. The campaign season has been marred by a wave of electoral violence and concerns that Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has undermined the country's democracy by attacking independent institutions. Fears rise of a second landslide and disease outbreak at site of Papua New Guinea disaster MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea’s mass-casualty disaster. U.N. official Serhan Aktoprak said Tuesday the mass of debris that devastated Yambali village in the South Pacific nation’s remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday is becoming more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble. The United Nations’ migrant agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers have died, while Papua New Guinea’s government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 were buried. Last year's deadly heat wave in metro Phoenix didn't discriminate PHOENIX (AP) — The victims of last summer's staggering 31-day streak of daily temperatures reaching 110 degrees Fahrenheit and over were old and young, male and female, homeless and well-to-do, Black, white, Hispanic, Asian American and Native American. There was a 19-year-old man addicted to fentanyl who collapsed in a roasting alley. A 96-year-old military veteran died in the hospital after being found unresponsive in his home without air conditioning. More than 400 of the 645 heat-related deaths Maricopa County public health officials have confirmed for 2023 were during that wave stretching from the last day in June through all of July. Celtics rally late again to close out Pacers for 4-0 sweep in Eastern Conference finals INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Derrick White’s tiebreaking 3-pointer with 43 seconds left gave Boston the lead and the Celtics closed out a four-game sweep of the Indiana Pacers 105-102 to reach the NBA Finals for the second time in three years. White finished with 16 points and only two 3s in the game. Jaylen Brown led Boston with 29 points while Jayson Tatum added 26 points. Indiana, which again played without two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, lost its second straight at home — both in the final minute after giving up leads. Andrew Nembhard had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds but missed a potentially tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds and the Pacers never go the ball again.",

        "description": "Jarren Duran is on pace for a Red Sox single-season record. \"That would honestly be a great accomplishment if I could do that.”",
        "content": "BALTIMORE — Jarren Duran leads the major leagues with eight triples and he’s on pace for 24. That would set a Red Sox single-season record. “That would be one hell of a stat,” Duran said. “I mean, it’s really hard. But so far, so good. So I guess we’ll just see how it turns out. But that would honestly be a great accomplishment if I could do that.” Hall of Fame center fielder Tris Speaker holds the Red Sox’ single-season record for triples with 22 in 1913. Duran is the first Red Sox player with eight triples in a season since Mookie Betts had eight in 2015. Duran needs only two more triples to become just the fourth Red Sox player this century with 10 or more triples in a season. He’d join Nomar Garciaparra (13 triples in 2003), Johnny Damon (11 triples in 2002) and Jacoby Ellsbury (10 triples in 2009). “It’s always fun to possibly have the chance to get an inside the parker when I’m running out the triple,” Duran said. “But also at the same time, it gives somebody else an opportunity to get an RBI so that’s always a fun thing, too. But I think running around the bases is always fun.” Levi Weaver and Ken Rosenthal recently noted in The Athletic , “In the divisional era (1969-present), there have only been six seasons of 20+ triples. The last two came in the same season, when Jimmy Rollins had 20 for the Phillies and Curtis Granderson hit a divisional-era record 23 for the Tigers .” For Duran, the most exciting offensive play in baseball is not the triple. It’s an inside-the-park homer. It took him just 15 seconds to score on an inside-the-park homer in a sim game for Triple-A Pawtucket at the alternate site in 2020. “I’m always thinking inside the parker until Huddy (third base coach Kyle Hudson ) stops me,” Duran said. “He usually stops me pretty soon.” Duran came close to an inside-the-park home run in July 2021 . He rounded all the bases vs. the Blue Jays but it was ruled a triple and that he took home on an error by the center fielder. “The one against Toronto that was a triple with an error,” Duran said. “Even though it kicked off a steel gate and they gave him an error for that.”",

        "content": "The fourth season of The Boys hits Prime Video soon, and it’s bringing beloved actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan into the fold. Morgan was first announced as joining in an August 2022 announcement. Since then, he’s been confirmed to be playing a character who has some in the comics. We don’t yet know many details about The Boys Season 4 or Morgan’s character, though the popular Prime Video has teased his name and relationships, prompting many . Before Season 4 premieres on Prime Video, here’s everything we know about Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s character on. Who is Jeffrey Dean Morgan playing in The Boys? This season will mark Morgan’s debut on the series. His arrival on The Boys also marks his long-awaited reunion with . It also checks off one of the latest of many Supernatural cameos on The Boys, following Jim Beavers’ multiple appearances as Robert “Dakota Bob” Singer, and Jensen Ackles as . What can we expect from Joe Kessler? Not much is known about Morgan’s character, Joe Kessler, but we can make a few guesses as to how he’ll factor into the series. Kessler was first seen in a teaser trailer released in December 2023. The trailer shows Kessler and Butcher meeting and shaking hands. The two clearly have some kind of friendly relationship, though Kessler is notably not familiar with The Boys themselves. Considering the comic character’s origins and Butcher’s various (albeit strained) ties to the CIA, it’s possible he and Kessler are working together to fight back against Homelander. Joe Kessler in the comics explained Howard Kessler is also known as Monkey, a nickname given to him by Butcher after an encounter with two monkeys who assaulted him. Related: Howard Kessler is a CIA analyst who is under the thumb of Billy Butcher. He’s constantly belittled, tortured, and, on at least two occasions, sexually assaulted, but Butcher only cares about Kessler’s value as an asset that provides information on Supes. Kessler eventually finds himself replacing Susan Raynor as deputy director at the CIA. Considering Raynor was killed in Season 2, it’s possible Kessler will join the series in a similar fashion. The Boys Season 4 releases on Prime Video on June 13, 2024. Until then, read about coming to Season 4, or our so far.",

        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Fintech firm Klarna, one of the early adopters of generative AI (GenAI), said on Tuesday it is using AI for purposes such as running marketing campaigns and generating images, saving about $10 million in costs annually. The company has cut its sales and marketing budget by 11% in the first quarter, with AI responsible for 37% of the cost savings, while increasing the number of campaigns, the company said. Using GenAI tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Firefly for image generation, Klarna said it has reduced image production costs by $6 million. It is using GenAI to update images on its app and website on a weekly basis, reflecting key retail events such as Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and summer sales. \"Traditionally, it would have been very costly to cater to these occasions with bespoke imagery, but with AI that is no longer an issue,\" Klarna CMO David Sandström said in a statement. \"Essentially, we have removed the need for stock imagery.\" It has generated more than 1,000 images in the first three months of 2024 using GenAI, reducing the image development cycle from six weeks to seven days. A further $4 million in savings come from cutting spending on external marketing suppliers for translation, production, and social agencies. Klarna had partnered with OpenAI for an AI assistant for its customer service that the company said was doing the equivalent work of 700 full-time agents.

The changes in society perceptions of dating and relationships are a major factor driving the global trend of online dating services and apps. According to the National Institute of Health (gov.) in November 2023, study that surveyed 2595 seventh-graders from 30 Taiwanese middle schools, 15% of them had used dating apps on the internet in the previous year. 15% of teenagers use dating apps occasionally, although the fact that most of these apps require users to be at least 18 years old. Among teenagers, the frequency of cybersexual victimization varies from 18 to 66%. Studies have shown a favorable correlation between cyber dating abuse and traditional abuse, in addition to the connection between teenage online dating violence and verbal, sexual, and physical dating violence.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDoes your portfolio contain bad growth stocks? These are some of the growth stocks to sell before it's too late.The post 3 Sorry Growth Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Growth stocks have captivated investors’ minds for many years. Some stocks have soared 1,000% over the past five years. The few growth stocks that reach that level of success have accumulated generational returns for their early investors. However, not every growth stock follows that script. Many growth stocks have lofty valuations due to the high expectations and significant risks. While pressure can create diamonds, it can also shatter companies. Some growth stocks aren’t poised to deliver promising returns for investors, let alone beat the stock market. These are some growth stocks to sell while you still can. ChargePoint (CHPT) ChargePoint (NYSE: CHPT ) reached public markets in 2021 via a SPAC. That set a market frenzy at a time when stocks commanded strong momentum if they had anything to do with electric vehicles. Investors overlooked glaring issues, hoping they had exposure to the next Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). However, it didn’t last. Reality has hit the stock hard, as it has been down by roughly 80% over the past year. It’s now a penny stock, and things don’t seem to be getting better. Revenue decreased by 24% year-over-year in Q4 FY24, while the company’s net loss went from $78.7 million to $94.7 million. That’s a 20.3% year-over-year increase in net losses . Declining electric vehicle sales don’t spell good news for ChargePoint. Less demand for EVs can create less of an incentive for the company’s EV charging solutions. The company doesn’t have much time to weather uncertainty as it continues to burn through cash while seeing its business shrink. Snap (SNAP) One good quarter has not undo the company’s problems. Snap (NYSE: SNAP ). Q1 2024 revenue increased by 21% year-over-year, which was impressive, but the company’s net losses remained high. Snap’s losses narrowed slightly from $329 million to $305 million. Profitability remains a key issue for the company, and it doesn’t look like Snap will become profitable anytime soon. Other social media giants have already reported a string of profitable quarters and have more robust business models. Daily active users increased by 10% year-over-year to reach 422 million. It looks like a growth stock again, but net losses and competition from other social networks can hamper the company’s growth potential. Investors can choose from other social media stocks with fewer risks, more attractive valuations and profitability. Wall Street analysts are mixed and have currently rated the stock as a “ Hold .” The highest price target is $20, while the lowest price target is $12. Etsy (ETSY) Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY ) has mixed reviews from analysts and is currently rated as a “ Hold .” The lowest price target of $45 per share suggests another 25% drop is on the way. It’s realistic for Etsy to reach that level due to its waning growth. The firm also lacks a viable plan for changing the situation. The e-commerce company reported a 3.7% year-over-year decline in consolidated gross merchandise sales in Q1 2024 . If this metric continues to decline, Etsy won’t have a path to long-term growth. Etsy’s only way to increase its revenue is to run ads and raise fees. It’s mostly been higher fees for buyers and sellers, creating a backlash. In the meantime, revenue increased by 0.8% year-over-year while net income decreased by $11.5 million year-over-year to reach $63.0 million. That’s a 15.5% year-over-year decline. Active sellers increased by 15.0% year-over-year, while active buyers increased by 0.9% year-over-year. If active buyers continue to grow slowly, sellers won’t have as many opportunities. More sellers and fewer buyers can result in more sellers not making enough income to justify keeping their stores open.

Once on the fringes, Hotze said Saturday that he was pleased by the party's growing embrace of his calls for spiritual warfare with “demonic, Satanic forces” on the left.

The party’s proposed platform also included planks that would effectively lock Democrats out of statewide office by requiring candidates to win a majority of Texas’ 254 counties, many of which are dark-red but sparsely populated, and called for laws requiring the Bible to be taught in public schools.Those moves, delegates and leaders agreed, were necessary amid what they say is an existential fight with a host of perceived enemies, be it liberals trying to indoctrinate their children through “gender ideology” and Critical Race Theory, or globalists waging a war on Christianity through migration.

Gov. Dan Patrick said Thursday morning.“Our battle is not against flesh and blood,” Sen. Angela Paxton, R-McKinney, said Friday. “It is against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.””Look at what the Democrats have done,” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Saturday. “If you were actively trying to destroy America, what would you do differently?”[“The house is on fire”: Texas GOP plots its next chapter amid civil war, depleted staff, funding drops]Controlling electionsThe Texas GOP’s conventions have traditionally amplified the party’s most hardline activists and views. In 2022, for instance, delegates approved a platform that included calls for a referendum on Texas secession; resistance to the “Great Reset,” a conspiracy theory that claims global elites are using environmental and social policies to enslave the world’s population; proclamations that homosexuality is an “abnormal lifestyle choice”; and a declaration that President Joe Biden was not legitimately elected.The 2024 convention went a step further.It was the first Texas GOP convention set against the backdrop of a civil war that was sparked by the impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton and inflamed by scandals over white supremacists and antisemites working for the party’s top funders, West Texas oil billionaires Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks. This year’s convention was also sparsely attended compared to past years, which some longtime party members said helped the Dunn and Wilks faction further consolidate their power and elect their candidate, Abraham George, for party chair.“What we're seeing right now is a shift toward more populism,” said Summer Wise, a former member of the party’s executive committee who has attended most conventions since 2008, including last week’s. “And the [party’s] infrastructure, leadership, decision-making process, power and influence are being controlled by a small group of people.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, R-McKinney, wave to attendees during the Republican Party of Texas convention in San Antonio on Thursday, May 23, 2024. Credit: Eli Hartman/The Texas TribuneThat shift was most evident, she said, in a series of changes to the party’s rules that further empower its leaders to punish dissent. The party approved changes that would dramatically increase the consequences of censures — which were used most recently to punish House Speaker Dade Phelan for his role in impeaching Paxton, and against U.S. Rep. Tony Gonzales for voting for gun safety legislation.Under the changes, any person who is censured by the party would be banned for two years from appearing on GOP primary ballots — including judges, who are elected in partisan races but expected to be politically neutral once on the bench. The party also voted to unilaterally close its primaries, bypassing the Legislature, in a move intended to keep Democrats from voting in Republican primaries.“It’s pretty hypocritical,” Wise said of the changes, which legal experts and some party members expect will face legal challenges. “Republicans have always opposed activist judges, and this seems to be obligating judges to observe and prioritize party over law — which is straight-up judicial activism.”The convention came amid a broader embrace of Christian nationalism on the right, which falsely claims that the United States’ founding was God-ordained and that its institutions and laws should reflect their conservative, Christian views. Experts have found strong correlations between Christian nationalist beliefs and opposition to migration, religious pluralism and the democratic process.[Proposed Texas GOP platform calls for the Bible in schools, electoral changes that would lock Democrats out of statewide office]Wise said she has seen parts of the party similarly shift toward dogmatic political and religious views that have been used “to justify or rationalize corrupting the institution and stripping away its integrity, traditions, fundamental and established principles\" — as if “‘God wants it, so we can rewrite the rules.’”“Being Republican and being Christian have become the same thing,” she said. “If you're accused of being a (Republican in Name Only), you're essentially not as Christian as someone else. ... God help you if you're Jewish.”The “rabbit hole”Bob Harvey is a proud member of the “Grumpy Old Men’s Club,” a group in Montgomery County that he said pushes back against Fox News and other outlets that he claims have been infiltrated by RINOs.“People trust Fox News, and they need to get outside of that and find alternative news and like-minded people,” Harvey, 71, said on Friday, as he waited in a long line to meet Kyle Rittenhouse, who has ramped up his engagement in Texas politics since he was acquitted of homicide after fatally shooting two Black Lives Matter protesters.Rather, Harvey’s group recommends places such as the Gateway Pundit, Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News or the Epoch Times, a far-right website that also had a booth at this year’s convention and is directly linked to the Falun Gong, a hardline anti-communist group.Such outlets, Harvey said, are crucial to getting people “further down the rabbit hole,” after which they can begin to connect the dots between the deep-state that has spent years attacking former President Donald Trump, and the agenda of the left to indoctrinate kids through the Boy Scouts of America, public schools and the Democratic Party.Harvey’s views were widely-held by his fellow delegates, many of whom were certain that broader transgender acceptance, Critical Race Theory or “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives were parts of a sinister plot to destroy the country and take over its churches.The culprits behind the ploy differed — Democrats, socialists or “globalists,” to name a few. But their nefarious end goals loomed over the convention. Fearing a transgender takeover of the Republican Party of Texas, delegates pushed to explicitly stipulate that the party’s chair and vice chair must be “biological” men or women.At events to recruit pastors and congregations to ramp up their political activism, elected leaders argued that churches were the only thing standing between evil and children. And the party’s proposed platform included planks that claim gender-transition care is child abuse, or urge new legislation in Texas that's \"even more comprehensive\" than Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law, which prohibits the teaching of sexual orientation or gender identity in public schools.

Credit: Eli Hartman/The Texas Tribune“Our next generation is being co-opted and indoctrinated where they should have been educated,” Rep. Nate Schatzline, R-Fort Worth, said at a Friday luncheon for pastors and churches. “We are in a spiritual battle. This isn't a political one.”For at least a half-century, conservative Christian movements have been fueled by notions of a shadowy and coordinated conspiracy to destroy America, said Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University who focuses on movements to put the Bible in public schools.“It's like the boogeyman that won't go away, that gets summoned whenever a justification is needed for these types of agendas,” he said. “They say that somebody is threatening quintessential American freedoms, and that these threats are posed by some sort of global conspiracy — rather than just recognizing that we're a pluralistic democracy.”In the 1950s, such claims were the driving force behind the emergence of groups such as the John Birch Society, a hardline anti-communist group whose early members included the fathers of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and Trump. After decades of dwindling influence, the society has seen a revival since Trump's 2016 election. And in the exhibit hall last week, so-called Birchers passed out literature and pamphlets that detailed the New World Order's secret plans for \"world domination.\"Steve Oglesby, field director for the Birch Society's North Texas chapter, said interest and membership in the group has been on the rise in recent years — particularly, as COVID-19 lockdowns and international climate change initiatives have spurred right-wing fears of an international cabal working against the United States.\"COVID really helped,\" he said, adding that the pandemic proved the existence of a global elite that has merely shifted its tactics since the 1950s. “It’s not just communism — it’s the people pulling the strings.”Throughout the week, prominent Republicans invoked similar claims of a coordinated conspiracy against the United States. On Friday, Patrick argued that a decadeslong decline in American religion was part of a broader, “Marxist socialist left” agenda to “create chaos,” including through migration — despite studies showing that migrants are overwhelmingly Christian. Attorney General Ken Paxton echoed those claims in his own speech minutes later, saying migration was part of a plan to \"steal another election.\"“The Biden Administration wants the illegals here to vote,” he said.

Credit: Eli Hartman/The Texas TribuneAs Paxton continued, Ella Maulding and Konner Earnest held hands and nodded their approval from the convention hall’s front row. Last year, the two were spotted outside of a Tarrant County office building where Nick Fuentes, a prominent white nationalist and Adolf Hitler fan, was hosted for nearly seven hours by Jonathan Stickland, then the leader of Dunn and Wilks' most powerful political action committee. They eventually lost their jobs after The Texas Tribune reported on their ties to Fuentes or white nationalist groups.Maulding has been particularly vocal about her support for Great Replacement Theory, a conspiracy theory that claims there is an intentional, often Jewish-driven, effort to replace white people through migration, LGBTQ+ acceptance or interracial marriage. Once a fringe, white nationalist worldview, experts say that Great Replacement Theory has been increasingly mainstreamed as Republican leaders, including some who spoke last week, continue to claim that migration is part of a coordinated effort to aid Democrats. The theory has also been cited by numerous mass shooters, including the gunman who murdered 22 Hispanic people at an El Paso WalMart in 2019.Five hours after Paxton and Patrick spoke, Maulding took to social media, posting a cartoon of a rabbi with the following text: “I make porn using your children and then make money distributing it under the banner of women’s rights while flooding your nation with demented lunatics who then rape your children.”David BartonKason Huddleston has spent the last few years helping elect Christians and push back against what he believes is indoctrination of children in Rowlett, near Dallas. Far too often, he said, churches and pastors have become complacent, or have been scared away from political engagement by federal rules that prohibit churches from overt political activity.Through trainings from groups like Christians Engaged, which advocates for church political activity and had a booth at this year’s convention, he said he has been able show more local Christians that they can be “a part of the solution” to intractable societal ills such as fatherlessness, crime or teen drug use. And while he thinks that some of his peers’ existential rhetoric can be overwrought, he agreed that there is an ongoing effort to “tear down the family unit” and shroud America’s true, Christian roots.“If you look at our government and our laws, all of it goes back to a Judeo-Christian basis,” he said. “Most people don’t know our true history because it’s slowly just been removed.”He then asked: “Have you ever read David Barton?”Since the late 1980s, Barton has barnstormed the state and country claiming that church-state separation is a “myth” meant to shroud America’s true founding as a Christian nation. Barton, a self-styled “amateur historian” who served as Texas GOP vice chair from 1997 to 2006, has been thoroughly debunked by an array of historians and scholars — many of them also conservative Christians. David Barton, left, of WallBuilders, at a Texas Eagle Forum reception at the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth on June 7, 2012. Credit: Bob Daemmrich for The Texas TribuneDespite that, Barton’s views have become widespread among Republicans, including Patrick, Texas Supreme Court Justice John Devine and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. And his influence over the party was clear at last week’s convention, where his group, WallBuilders, maintained a booth and delegates frequently cited him.This year’s platform, the votes for which are expected to be released later this week, included planks that urged lawmakers and the State Board of Education to “require instruction on the Bible, servant leadership and Christian self-governance,” and supports the use of religious chaplains in schools — which was made legal under a law passed by the state Legislature last year.Warren Throckmorton, a former Grove City College professor and prominent conservative, Christian critic of Barton, told the Tribune that the platform emblematized Barton’s growing influence, and his movement’s conflicting calls to preserve “religious liberty” while attempting to elevate their faith over others. The platform, he noted, simultaneously demands that students’ religious rights be protected, and for schools to be forced to teach the Bible.“What about the other students who aren’t Christians and who don't believe in the Bible?” he said. “This is not religious liberty — it’s Christian dominance.”As Zach Maxwell watched his fellow Republicans debate and vote last week, he said he was struck by the frequency and intensity with which Christianity was invoked. Maxwell previously served as chief of staff for former Rep. Mike Lang, then the leader of the ultraconservative Texas House Freedom Caucus, and he later worked for Empower Texans, a political group that was funded primarily by Dunn and Wilks.He eventually became disillusioned with the party’s right wing, which he said has increasingly been driven by purity tests and opposition to religious or political diversity. This year’s convention, he said, was the culmination of those trends.“God was not only used as a tool at this convention, but if you didn’t mention God in some way, fake or genuine, I did feel it was seen as distasteful,” he said. “There is a growing group of people who want to turn this nation into a straight-up theocracy. I believe they are doing it on the backs of people who are easily manipulated.”Disclosure: Southern Methodist University has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Donald Trump has overtly taken the side of dictators including Putin, Xi, Orbán, and Kim over the past eight years, most likely because he admires the way each has crushed efforts toward democracy and ruled their respective nations with an iron fist. Now US intelligence agencies say their big worry is that one or more of these nations will reciprocate Trump’s love by launching some sort of October Surprise to push voters closer to Trump in time for this fall’s election. Such an action could swing our election toward Trump, but also risks provoking a third world war. The phrase October Surprise , of course, refers to the successful deal that the Reagan campaign cut with Iran’s Ayatollah’s government to hold the American hostages in the US Embassy in Tehran until after the 1980 election to destroy President Jimmy Carter’s chances. Both Iran’s then-president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , and the former Lt. Governor of Texas, Ben Barnes, have verified the plot, the latter last year in The New York Times . An earlier (unknown until the past two decades) plot by the campaign of candidate Richard Nixon to blow up the 1968 Paris peace talks and thus sabotage President Johnson’s deal with the Vietnamese was the first known successful Republican effort to use treason to steal an election. It qualified for the October Surprise label, but wasn’t known until well after Reagan’s efforts had earned the title.

Bush, and used them to purge tens of thousands of Black and Hispanic Florida voters with similar names from the Florida voter rolls in the months immediately before that year’s election. George “won” the 2000 election by 537 votes (he lost the national popular vote by a half-million), although the Florida Supreme Court-ordered recount that was blocked by five corrupt Republicans on the US Supreme Court would have revealed that setup and several other ways Jeb had rigged the election that year for his brother, and put Al Gore into the White House. Two of the three October Surprise events employed by Republican candidates for president involved colluding with foreign governments to harm a Democratic candidate; Reagan’s hit on Carter was particularly treasonous and effective. Nixon’s — appropriate to remember on Memorial Day — caused the death of an additional 20,000+ American GIs in Vietnam. So, it’s entirely reasonable to assume that Trump — still in touch with Putin, Kim, and Xi, even if only through media proclamations — is either planning or expecting help this fall from his autocratic pals. Putin, desperate for more weapons to crush democracy in Ukraine, has formed a strong alliance over the past year with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, trading battlefield weapons for submarine and other technology that Kim can use along with nuclear weapons to threaten the US. In an NBC News article from May 24th titled “ Are Russia and North Korea planning an ‘October surprise’ that aids Trump ? ” reporters Cortney Kube and Carol E. Lee note that there could be serious consequences arising from the fact that North Korea is today giving Russia more weaponry to use against Ukraine than all of Europe has been able to provide to President Zelenskyy: “U.S. officials are also bracing for North Korea to potentially take its most provocative military actions in a decade close to the U.S. presidential election, possibly at Putin’s urging... “The increasingly close relationship between Putin and Kim represents a major shift from when Russia worked with the U.S. in the past to try to rein in North Korea. Now, Moscow is using its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to give Pyongyang cover to evade sanctions enforcement measures intended to constrain its nuclear program.” North Korea firing missiles into the demilitarized zone between it and South Korea to help Trump could represent a major escalation of tensions in the region, as would an October nuclear test or attack on South Korea’s border islands. It could also precipitate a major war in the region with the potential to spread worldwide. While China has, in the past, counseled Kim to refrain from overly bombastic or provocative behavior to keep tensions in the region low, their increasingly bellicose actions and rhetoric toward Taiwan suggest they may welcome regional chaos which Xi could then use as a pretext to attack that island nation. As Michael Schuman wrote for an article titled “ Why Xi Wants Trump to Win ” in The Atlantic : “By weakening U.S. standing abroad and democracy at home, Trump would offer Xi more opportunities than Biden to extend Chinese influence and win hearts and minds within the developing world.” Our government has noticed: Three months ago, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) published their Annual Threat Assessment . It was unambiguous about what they’re already seeing in the works for this election year: “The PRC [People’s Republic of China] may attempt to influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions. PRC actors’ have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation. ... The PRC aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing’s influence.” Similarly, The New York Times reported last month that China — in a move reminiscent of Putin’s millions of Internet Research Agency troll posts promoting Trump on Facebook leading up to the 2016 election — is all in on using social media, including, apparently, TikTok, to crush Biden and lift Trump into the White House: “Some of the Chinese accounts impersonate fervent Trump fans, including one on X that purported to be ‘a father, husband and son’ who was ‘MAGA all the way!!’ The accounts mocked Mr. Biden’s age and shared fake images of him in a prison jumpsuit, or claimed that Mr. Biden was a Satanist pedophile while promoting Mr. Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan.” Any of these actions by China could be a trigger for an international conflagration pitting America and Asian democracies against an axis of China, North Korea, and Russia. If Europe jumped in to help, we’d be in the middle of World War III faster than most imagine possible. Another hostile dictatorship that believes a Trump presidency would work to its advantage is Iran, which has worked with Republican presidential candidates before. It’s today run by the heirs to the regime that successfully handed the 1980 election to Reagan, and tried to help Trump get elected in 2020. As the DNI’s Annual Threat Assessment noted : “Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past. During the U.S. election cycle in 2020, Iranian cyber actors obtained or attempted to obtain U.S. voter information, sent threatening emails to voters, and disseminated disinformation about the election. “The same Iranian actors have evolved their activities and developed a new set of techniques, combining cyber and influence capabilities, that Iran could deploy during the U.S. election cycle in 2024.” Given Iran’s role in supporting Hamas’ brutal raid on Israel last October and the increased pressure the Biden administration is putting them under, disrupting our election to put Trump — no fan of democracy — into office apparently makes a lot of sense to the violent mullahs clinging to power in that country. At the very least, Trump may dial back (as he did when president before) the efforts of Voice of America and other US propaganda and outreach efforts aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime. Combine Iran’s efforts with those of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu — who is both openly hostile to President Biden (as he was to President Obama) and fond of Trump — and an expansion of conflict in the Middle East also has the potential to both influence the US election and lead to a larger international war. Netanyahu, under indictment for bribery and corruption with the cases against him paused until he’s no longer in office, has a powerful personal incentive to drag out the war (and the deaths of Gazans) just to stay out of prison. An alliance with a second Trump presidency would be political gold for him. Every time Netanyahu commits another war crime or gives America and the international community the middle finger over his use of famine as an instrument of war, more young Americans peel away from Biden in frustration. While they probably won’t vote for Trump, polling from 2020 shows that if they hadn’t shown up for Biden in that election, Trump would have held onto the presidency. And Netanyahu knows it. This past week, Trump told a group of wealthy Jewish donors that if student protests of Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza happened during his presidency, he would not only arrest them but he would strip them American citizenship and deport them from the country. It’s his most explicit shout out so far to Netanyahu, and will certainly encourage the Prime Minister to continue to ignore President Biden and enrage the Democratic base. Finally, Russia’s President Putin knows that a second Trump term will be like a gift from the gods. He’s lost over a half-million soldiers and a massive amounts of equipment in his brutal war against Ukraine, and is facing rising anger at home. Trump, who has essentially promised to cut off US support for that besieged nation, could literally save Putin’s life if his generals are thinking of taking him out the way Hitler’s tried to do. To that end, Russia and Saudi Arabia recently collaborated to cut oil production by 1.4 million barrels a day in an effort to drive up gas prices here in the US, just like they did in October/November of 2022. Since Trump let the Saudis buy the largest refinery in America (at Port Arthur, Texas), expect gas prices to be over $5/gallon this fall. The stakes are incredibly high for Putin; he may well think an attack against a NATO country, if not answered with a swift, massive response, would reveal weakness in the Biden administration that could help Trump this fall. And if NATO does respond vigorously, that could toss us into WWIII. Most recently, Trump shouted out to Putin in an echo of Reagan’s traitorous embrace of Iran, essentially asking him to humiliate Biden by holding onto imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich until after the election. This has to encourage Russia’s truculence in the face of international pressure to stop killing Ukrainian civilians. Both the American Civil War and World War II came about when explicitly authoritarian leaders used military force to try to violently destroy democratic nations’ way of life. A predatory new axis has formed including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China that is every bit as opposed to representative government as was Hitler’s Third Reich. And Trump empowered them by killing the Iran nuclear deal President Obama had negotiated, allowing them to resume making nukes; embracing Kim and Xi; and giving top secret information to Putin. Meanwhile, three of those nations are actively involved in propaganda operations — principally exploiting social media and Republican politicians like Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance — to denigrate democracy and majority rule and elevate oligarchy and strongman rule. Will one of these “help Trump get elected while advancing our own interests” scenarios by one or more of these axis nations lead to the end of democracy in America or a third world war? At this point it’s too early to tell, but EU and Asian democracies are increasingly worried about that exact scenario. In war, things can change suddenly in ways nobody anticipated; events frequently spiral out of control (as did the events leading to WWI). We all need to stay alert and remain outspoken about the dangers Trump represents, and do what we can to support democracy worldwide. Forewarned is forearmed: pass it along. NOW READ: Why the media doesn't talk to Biden's supporters CONTINUE READING Show less There has been a lot of speculation about what would have happened if Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Donald Trump for the Espionage Act case in another venue, as opposed to Florida, but that's a \"false premise,\" according to a former attorney with the CIA. Brian D. Greer, an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel from 2010 to 2018, addressed recent claims that Smith should have brought the classified documents case in Washington, D.C., perhaps avoiding Judge Aileen Cannon, who has been accused of bias in favor of the ex-president who appointed her to her spot on the federal bench. \"Since the 'Smith should have just brought the documents case in DC' chorus is picking up again, it's time for a reminder as to why that's not true,\" Greer said Monday. \"Please read before continuing to propagate this false premise.\" ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy Greer goes on to say that \"Smith is bound by the Constitution, federal law, and case law -- which collectively requires that, at minimum, a 'conduct element' of the offense be committed in the district where it's charged.\" \"Let's look at the offenses,\" the lawyer added. \"For the Espionage Act charges, Trump is charged with unlawfully retaining the docs. The issue with charging him in DC is that he was still POTUS when he removed the docs from the White House down to Florida. He arguably was within his rights to do so, even if it's egregious.\" He continued: \"Simply put: it was not a crime while POTUS, even though that's hard to swallow. No conduct element in DC. For the Espionage Act charges, that might still leave a conspiracy charge. Was an 'overt act' committed in DC? Maybe, but Trump would have been POTUS when that act occurred.\" Greer goes on to say, \"Charging that 'overt act' would have run straight into a presidential immunity assertion, as handling classified records is likely to be seen as an official act while President.\" \"Everything that's happened w the J6 case would have happened here... except Trump would have had a better immunity argument, one that SCOTUS likely would have sided with, before trial,\" he added. \"So that leaves the various obstruction charges. There too, all of the 'conduct elements' for those charges occurred in Florida, not DC.\" Greer concluded by saying that \"having to charge the case in S.D. Florida, where drawing Cannon was very likely, completely sucked.\" \"But prosecutors are bound by the Constitution, the law, and reality -- so charging the case there was the right thing to do, and really the only [choice] they had,\" he added. \"Womp womp.\" CONTINUE READING Show less Former President Donald Trump's Memorial Day remarks were met with fierce backlash from a slew of journalists, as well as legal and political experts Monday. The MAGA leader's message — which was posted to Truth Social — included attacks on Judges Lewis Kaplan, who presided over two defamation cases against Trump from veteran writer E. Jean Carroll, and Arthur Engoron, who presided over the ex-president's New York civil fraud case. He also mentioned Judge Juan Merchan, who's presiding over Trump's hush money trial, which is expected to conclude this week. The former president wrote: Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn't count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for 'DEFAMATION.'

These high initial costs can strain the financial resources of mining companies, particularly smaller ones, creating uncertainty regarding the return on investment. Access to capital is also challenging in developing regions or for smaller operations, as financial institutions may hesitate to fund green mining projects due to perceived risks. Technological Advances Autonomous vehicles, remote monitoring, and advanced analytics are key technological advances in green mining. Autonomous vehicles enhance safety and efficiency by reducing human error and optimizing routes. Remote monitoring systems enable real-time data collection and informed decision-making, improving operational efficiency and safety. Advanced analytics optimize ore extraction, predict equipment failures, and minimize environmental impacts, enhancing productivity and reducing costs. Regional Insights Asia-Pacific dominated the green mining market in 2022, driven by rising environmental awareness and government initiatives promoting sustainable practices. The region's high energy demand and the shift towards cleaner mining technologies, such as renewable energy integration, further support market growth. Impact of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains, reducing the availability of mining equipment and raw materials, delaying project timelines, and affecting production. Economic slowdowns led to decreased demand for minerals, impacting the profitability of green mining projects. Despite these challenges, the pandemic highlighted the importance of sustainability, likely increasing support and investment in green mining post-pandemic. Key Players Key players in the green mining market include BHP, Rio Tinto, Anglo American PLC, Glencore PLC, Liebherr, Tata Steel Mining Limited, Jiangxi Copper Corporation Limited, Exxaro, Dundee Precious Metals Inc., and Komatsu Ltd. Investment and strategic agreements are common strategies among these major market players. Market Segmentation The green mining market is segmented by mining type (surface, underground, placer, in-situ), mineral or metal extracted (mineral fuels, iron & ferro-alloys, non-ferrous metals, precious metals, industrial minerals), and technology (mine filling, water preservation, simultaneous extraction, oxidizing utilization of VAM, etc.). Regions analyzed include North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. Green mining practices, driven by regulatory demands and technological advances, offer significant environmental benefits and long-term cost savings despite high initial investments. The market's growth is bolstered by increasing environmental awareness and regulatory support, particularly in regions like Asia-Pacific.

        "description": "Palestinian first responders say Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 people",
        "content": "Israeli strikes on Rafah have killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said Tuesday, as residents reported an escalation of fighting in the southern Gaza city. An Israeli incursion launched in early May has caused nearly 1 million to flee from Rafah, most of whom have already been displaced in the war between Israel and Hamas , and who are now seeking refuge in squalid tent camps and war-ravaged areas. The United States and other close allies of Israel have warned against a full-fledged offensive in the city, with the Biden administration saying it would cross a red line and refusing to provide offensive arms for such an undertaking. On Friday, the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its Rafah offensive , an order it has no power to enforce. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead, saying Israeli forces must go into Rafah in order to dismantle Hamas and return hostages taken in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The latest strikes occurred in the same area where Israel targeted what it said was a Hamas compound on Sunday night. That strike ignited a fire in a camp for displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local health officials, sparking worldwide outrage. Netanyahu said there was a “tragic mishap” on Sunday and the military said it was investigating. Strikes overnight killed a total of 16 people in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood in northwest Rafah, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense and the Palestinian Red Crescent. Israel says it is carrying out limited operations in eastern Rafah along the Gaza-Egypt border. But residents reported heavy bombardment overnight in western parts of Rafah as well. “It was a night of horror,” said Abdel-Rahman Abu Ismail, a Palestinian from Gaza City who has been sheltering in Tel al-Sultan since December. He said he heard “constant sounds” of explosions overnight and into Tuesday morning, with fighter jets and drones flying over the area. He said it reminded him of the Israeli invasion of of his neighborhood of Shijaiyah in Gaza City, where Israel launched a heavy bombing campaign before sending in ground forces in late 2023. “We saw this before,” he said. Sayed al-Masri, a Rafah resident, said many families have been forced to flee their homes and shelters, with most heading for the crowded Mawasi area, where giant tent camps have been set up on a barren coastline, or to Khan Younis, a southern city that suffered heavy damage during months of fighting. “The situation is worsening” in Rafah, al-Masri said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said two medical facilities in Tel al-Sultan have been taken out of service because of intense bombing nearby. Medical Aid for Palestinians, a charity operating throughout the territory, said the Tel al-Sultan medical center and the Indonesian Field Hospital were under lockdown, with medics, patients and displaced people trapped inside. Most of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functioning . The Kuwait Hospital in Rafah shut down Monday after a strike near its entrance killed two health workers. The war began when Hamas and other militants burst into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 civilians and abducting around 250. More than 100 were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a massive air, land and sea offensive that has killed over 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced and United Nations officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "New book is for those who want to learn about socialism and revolutionary politics Why is the book coming out now? SB: We chose to write Why You Should Be A Socialist because of the global movement for Palestine. It follows other explosive movements, such as Black Lives Matter (BLM) and the climate rebellion, and the strike wave. LN: Something big is happening to a whole generation of people who have been involved in these mass movements that have shaken up politics in a big way. None of the mainstream political parties provide any genuine answers to climate change, racism, Gaza, or the many crises society is facing. So many feel like mainstream politics doesn’t represent them anymore. SB: Arguments for revolution are more relevant than ever as people seek an alternative. This book is aimed at them. Why should people read this book? Sophie Beach People should read the book because it introduces some of the most important arguments in society. It answers questions about how capitalism works and how racism, sexism, and imperialism are built into the system. LN: And the book outlines what our revolutionary politics has to offer. It goes through big questions like, “Is revolution possible?”, “Is human nature a barrier to socialism?”, and, “What went wrong in Stalinist Russia?” We want it to be used by those involved in struggles and to make them feel confident about convincing others of revolutionary ideas. If the book goes a small way towards that, then that would be a very good thing. SB: Crucially, the book maps out a pathway of how we can win. Whether you are angry about the capitalist system or starting to think you might be a socialist, you should read it. If you’re already a socialist, the book answers some big questions about socialism, such as how we organise society in a more democratic way. It is something everyone should read, and encourage others to read in their workplaces and in the movement. Why is the book arguing for revolution? LN: Because parliamentary politics has failed. Over the last few years we’ve seen the demise of left wing projects that think reform is the way forward. The 2010s was a decade when left reformism—a strategy that tries to achieve socialism through parliament—came to the forefront. You had Jeremy Corbyn leading the Labour Party in Britain, Syriza in office in Greece, Podemos in Spain, the Left Bloc in Portugal and Bernie Sanders in the United States. They were positive developments that, but all these projects failed. There is an opening now for people who recognise that even making reforms within a capitalist system won’t solve the many crises we face. Capitalism is promising us a future of economic crisis, climate crisis, political crisis and relentless war—the instability in the political system means the far right is on the rise. We argue that revolution is necessary to avoid capitalism taking us down this dangerous road. SB: And there’s a general election in six weeks’ time. Nobody has any illusions in what Labour is bringing to the table. As Lewis said, this is not just because of how awful Keir Starmer is but also because there are deeper systemic issues about reformism’s failure to deliver change. If you want real transformative change in society—which the recent mass movements show that many ordinary people also want—we need system change, not just a changing of hands at the top of society. Why aren’t movements enough? LN: Movements, such as the Palestine movement, the climate protests or the BLM movement, can create huge political earthquakes and pull in big numbers of people. But the ruling class can often find ways to tame them, channelling them towards a place that is respectable and safe. In the book, we argue that if we want systemic change, we need these movements to enter the workplace much more widely. We’ve been saying for a while that we need to shut down the system to stop Israel’s assault on Gaza. Workers walking out and striking would be impossible for our leaders to ignore and could force our government to stop its support for Israel. When we talk about deepening the movement for Palestine, this is what we mean. SB: Also movements can go up like a rocket and down like a stick. We need something more sustained where we struggle every day for revolution. This means a revolutionary organisation that is genuinely part of movements—not on the sidelines—fighting to bring workers into the struggle. LN: The first task of revolutionaries is to get stuck in and be a part of a movement—the debates and actions and be a part of deepening it—while building a revolutionary pole of attraction within them. How are the problems we face today linked? SB: The roots of all of today’s problems are located in the same thing— capitalism. But we also need to be more analytical than that. For instance, large swathes of people involved in the Palestine movement are asking, “How did we get to the situation that we are in?” To answer that we have to understand Israel as a product of imperialism and part of a system where war, violence and racism are endemic to it. As revolutionary socialists, we argue that the problems we face are linked. The fight against Tories and their racism is the same fight against Israel’s genocide, the same fight against transphobia and the same fight against climate chaos. LN: Following up from that, it’s a mistake to talk about the crises we face today as a series of crises happening at the same time. Instead they should be seen as part of the totality of capitalism. Since the economic crisis of 2008, we are seeing more and more economic instability. This instability hasn’t happened in a vacuum but because capitalism is a chaotic, volatile system. If you look at Palestine, a profound crisis of imperialism has flowed into an economic crisis. Houthi rebels attacking ships for Palestine in the Red Sea has disrupted the supply chains of global capitalism. Capitalism creates a total crisis that requires a total response. SB: It’s a system that has exploitation and oppression written into its fabric. You have to fight on all genuine issues that ordinary people face. Only a fight that links up all of the struggles against our broken system will get rid of it What would you say to someone who thinks political parties are the problem? SB: It’s no surprise that many working people don’t trust political parties. The Tories have presided over 14 years of austerity, and the Labour Party is headed by a man who has betrayed the Palestinians and promised he will stand with the bosses when he gets into office. And again, it’s not like most left wing parties are much of an appealing alternative. Stalinist communist parties have repeatedly let workers down and been a barrier to them making real revolutionary change. Lewis Nielson A revolutionary socialist party like the SWP hopes to be different. Our aim in the SWP is to gather the most radical sections of the working class to lead struggle in every workplace and campus. We see that the only way to have revolutionary change and to sustain it is to have a leadership that is coordinated and organised. Our rulers are organised and so we must be as well. A revolutionary party that is organised in a democratic and centralised way is the best way to pull together leaders in any fightback. LN: To echo that, the SWP is made up of people who are won to the idea that we have to break from the logic of capitalism—that we have to build a new socialist society from the bottom up. We can play a role in building struggle—and in that struggle, pull it towards a confrontation with the state and capitalism. We don’t pretend to have all the answers. We don’t pretend that the SWP is the finished article. But we do think that the whole history of revolutionary struggle shows us that we can’t wait for a revolution to build an organisation. You have to build the embryo in the here and now. And that’s what we are trying to do with the SWP. Can students transform society?

The country has been making significant strides in AI technology, semiconductors , and open-source AI , and this move further solidifies its commitment to developing non-oil sectors. Investments in the healthcare industry are also a part of the country’s broader strategy to boost the private sector and attract foreign investment. This is evident in the recent success of healthcare IPOs in the country, such as the Dr. Soliman Abdul Kader Fakeeh Hospita l’s IPO, which was oversubscribed by institutional investors, according to the report.

ADVERTISEMENT Additional Sessions Judge Sameer Bajpai rejected the bail plea. The detailed order is awaited, reported PTI. Supreme Court judge Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra on Wednesday recused himself from hearing a plea filed by former Umar Khalid seeking bail in a UAPA case related to the alleged conspiracy behind the riots in Delhi in February 2020.

Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra recused himself from the case without providing specific reasons. Justice Bopanna mentioned that the case would be listed before another bench due to Justice Mishra's inability to hear the matter. The Delhi Police had filed a counter affidavit in response to Khalid's petition, but there were objections from the apex court registry regarding certain portions of the statements being in vernacular. The bench posted the matter for further hearing on August 17 and instructed that the counter affidavit be taken on record. Umar Khalid, along with other individuals including , has been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and provisions of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly being the \"masterminds\" behind the riots in February 2020 during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Khalid had sought bail, arguing that he had no criminal role in the violence and no conspiratorial connection with the other accused. The Delhi High Court had rejected Khalid's bail plea, stating that he was in constant communication with other co-accused and that the allegations against him were prima facie true. The high court had categorized his actions as a \"terrorist act\" under UAPA. The Supreme Court had sought a response from the Delhi Police regarding Khalid's plea challenging the high court's decision.",

Further, in April 2022, the American Journal of Managed Care, a US-based peer-reviewed journal, found that 43% of 40,000 patients had at least one skin condition or issue within the last 12 months.

        "content": "“He said you can't leave the table until the champagne is done, and it just wouldn't stop” The Script ’s Danny O’Donoghue has opened up about an intense drinking session with Tom Jones that landed him in hospital. The time took place when he and Sir Tom were part of the original judging line-up on the UK version of The Voice back in 2012 – complete with Jessie J and Black Eyed Peas ’ Will.i.am . According to the frontman, there was one night where he went out with the Welsh rock legend for the night, but soon found himself unable to keep up with the ‘She’s A Lady’ singer – despite being 40 years younger than him. “It was after one show on The Voice and we were in the Lowry [hotel] up in Manchester and we went drinking that night,” O’Donoghue recalled during an interview with BBC Radio Wales (via BBC News ). “He was telling me all these stories about Elvis and the Rat Pack and every time the champagne got to, like, a certain level, he’d be clicking [his fingers] to get another bottle of champagne. “And he said you can’t leave the table until the champagne is done. And it just wouldn’t stop!” He went on to recall how his determination to keep up with Sir Tom ultimately led to him heading to the hospital, as his heart “flipped into a different rhythm”. “We’re probably there six hours or something, from 12 o’clock to six in the morning. And I just remember thinking, ‘What’s all the clinking going on’ and they were putting out the things for breakfast in the morning.” Sir Tom Jones, Jessie J, Will.i.am and Danny O’Donoghue attend a photocall to launch the second series of ‘The Voice’, 2013. (Photo by Mike Marsland/WireImage/Getty Images) It was the next morning, he said, that he noticed something was wrong. “I didn’t know what was going on so I went to the hospital – and I got atrial fibrillation from drinking nothing but champagne for six hours,” he told the outlet. He also added that he was forced to miss “one or two days of filming” for The Voice due to the night. “It was my fault because I should have stopped drinking very early,” he concluded, going on to share his admiration for the singer. “I don’t mean to age him but he’s from the same era as my dad, but he’s a man’s man, grew up in the coal mines, loves songs, loved drinking. “What an amazing career that guy’s had... And like all Welsh people they’re so down to earth, it’s easy to forget how big and how legendary Tom is but he makes you feel that way himself, but I really, really loved my time with him.” In other Script news, last August the Irish group released their new single ‘Both Ways’ – which is taken from their upcoming LP ‘Satellites’. The album is set for release in August, and follows on from the death of the band’s co-founder and guitarist, Mark Sheehan last April, following a brief illness. As for Tom Jones, the Welsh crooner has been announced for multiple live appearances throughout 2024, including this year’s edition of Byron Bay festival Bluesfest and next month’s Plymouth Summer Sessions .",

        "content": "\"[My role] seemed like a little thing but, you know, 'The Flintstones' was the fabric of our culture” Halle Berry has shared a new video on social media, where she reflects on her role in 1994’s The Flintstones , which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. On Monday (May 27), Berry posted the clip on her Instagram page . “You guys message me every year about The Flintstones film so I thought I’d do something special for the 30th anniversary,” she wrote. In the video, the actress dissects a scene from the film that introduces her character to on-screen protagonists Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) and Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis). “I thought it might be really cool to look at some of my scenes because I legit haven’t seen this movie in probably 20 years,” she says. Aside from talking about the minute details of her role – her voice and hairstyle, the latter of which she called “iconic” – she also acknowledged how the role felt “important” to her. “Being a Black woman in Bedrock seemed like a little thing but, you know, The Flintstones was the fabric of our culture,” she explains. “I knew that this was a big step forward for Black people, Black women especially,” Berry added. “While it was silly, and it was over the top and campy, I knew then how important this little part in this big movie actually would be.” A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) Berry had made her film debut just three years prior to The Flintstones in Spike Lee’s Jungle Fever . Earlier this year, it was reported that The Mothership , a sci-fi film starring Berry, had been scrapped entirely by Netflix , despite having already completed filming in 2021. However, Berry remains busy with two completed projects scheduled for release this year: Netflix’s The Union , an action-comedy in which she stars with Mark Wahlberg, and Never Let Go , a supernatural horror film. Berry will also star in Maude vs Maude alongside Angelina Jolie. Last December, Berry admitted that the two actors “had a rocky start” to their working relationship.",

        "content": "French LGBT+ groups have filed a complaint with the Paris Public Prosecutor against far-right politician Marion Maréchal-Le Pen accusing her of “transphobic insult” for comments she made about Karla Sofía Gascón ’s Best Actress win at the Cannes Film Festival over the weekend. Gascón made history as the first transgender actress to win the Cannes Best Actress prize alongside co-stars Zoe Saldaña, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz for their performances in Jacques Audiard gangster musical Emilia Perez . In response to the win, Maréchal Le Pen posted on X: “So a man has won the Best Actress prize... progress for the left is the erasure of women and mothers.” Related Stories Festivals Zoe Saldaña Talks ‘Avatar 4’ Update & Keeping Up With Karla Sofía Gascón In Acclaimed Movie ‘Emilia Perez’ – Cannes Studio Festivals Greta Gerwig-Led Cannes Jury On Awarding Palme d’Or To ‘Anora’ In Year That Had “Embarrassment Of Riches” Spanish actress Gascón, who plays a Mexican drug lord undergoing a sex change, dedicated the prize to “all trans people who suffer every day” and evoked the struggles of trans people in the face of prejudice. French LGBT+ orgs Mousse, LGBT Families, Adheos, Quazar, LBGTI+ Federation and STOP homophobia said they had filed a complaint against Maréchal-Le Pen on Monday with the Paris Public Prosecutor for “insult due to gender identity”. They noted in a statement that the offence is punishable by one year of imprisonment and a fine of 45,000 euros under French law. Maréchal Le Pen dismissed the filing in an interview with French radio station France Inter on Tuesday morning, saying: “I’m not going to let myself be intimidated by legal threats from LGBT militant- activists... the truth is that being a man or a woman is a biological reality, whether you like it or not. The XX and XY chromosomes cannot be undone.” Maréchal Le Pen is currently on the campaign trail for European Parliament elections in June, as head of Reconquête!, the far-right party founded by former failed presidential candidate Eric Zemmour. The LGBT+ groups noted that Zemmour had previously been charged and found guilty of homophobia in September 2023, in relation to comments he made on the populist news channel CNews in 2019. “Marion Maréchal Le Pen denies the existence of transgender people, as well as the violence and discrimination these people are the victim of every day,” said Étienne Deshoulières, the lawyer representing the LGBT group collective. STOP homophobie General Secretary Terrence Khatchadourian suggested tha t Maréchal-Le Pen’s comments – which he qualified as “illegal behaviour” reinforced a climate of violence for LGBT+ people in France. “Marion Maréchal-Le Pen’s speeches are also heard by those who take action,” he said. “Since 2016, violence against LGBT+ people has exploded by more than 129%, with the largest increase affecting transgender people. We are therefore more determined than ever to protect them.”",

        "content": "Children’s products sold by the Chinese-founded online shopping giant Shein contained toxic substances in amounts hundreds of times above acceptable levels, the government of South Korea’s capital Seoul said Tuesday. Shein, headquartered in Singapore, has skyrocketed in popularity around the world in recent years, offering a vast selection of trendy clothes and accessories at stunningly low prices. This explosive growth has also led to increased scrutiny of its business practices and safety standards, including in the European Union and South Korea — where Seoul authorities have been conducting weekly inspections of items sold by platforms including Shein, Temu and AliExpress. In the latest round, they selected eight products sold by Shein, including children’s shoes, leather bags and a belt and found several to contain high amounts of phthalates — chemicals used to soften plastics. One pair of shoes contained 428 times the permitted levels of phthalates — the highest observed so far during the Seoul inspections — and three bags had amounts as high as 153 times the limit, the city government said. Phthalates are widely used to soften plastic and are found in thousands of products including containers, beauty products and toys. However, they have been known for decades to cause hormone disruptions and have been linked to obesity, heart disease, some cancers and fertility problems. Seoul city official Park Sang-jin told AFP they had requested removal of these products from sale, and said that since the city began inspections in April, most platforms have complied with such requests. A Shein spokesperson told AFP the company “takes product safety very seriously”. The company requires its suppliers to comply with its controls and standards, and works with international third-party testing agencies to ensure compliance with product safety standards, it said. “Upon learning of any claim against our products, we immediately remove the product(s) from our site as a matter of caution whilst conducting our investigations,” it said, adding it takes appropriate follow-up action “if non-compliance is verified”. So far, Seoul authorities said they have inspected 93 products and found that almost half of them contained toxic substances. These items include children’s watches and colouring pencils. Last month, the European Union added Shein to its list of digital firms that are big enough to come under stricter safety rules — including measures to protect customers from unsafe products, especially those that could be harmful to minors. Shein and Temu have followed Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba in challenging Amazon, especially by making inroads in the US market. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "Prosecutors in the trial of Donald Trump will make a final pitch to the jury on Tuesday, in their historic pursuit of the first ever criminal conviction of a former US president. Less than six months before American voters choose whether to return Trump to the White House, the stakes riding on the verdict are hard to overstate - for the 77-year-old personally, but also for the country as a whole. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to buy the silence of adult film star Stormy Daniels over a 2006 sexual encounter between them that could have damaged his 2016 presidential bid. If convicted, he faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time. Crucially, a conviction would not bar Trump from appearing on the ballot in November as the Republican presidential challenger to Democrat Joe Biden. READ | 'We should not be fighting each other': Trump appeals to libertarians who boo and jeer at him It has taken nearly five weeks, the testimony of more than 20 witnesses and a few courtroom fireworks to reach closing arguments - the last chance for the prosecution and defence to impress their case on the anonymous, 12-member jury. As expected, Trump chose not to testify in his defence - a move that would have exposed him to unnecessary legal jeopardy and forensic cross-examination. Instead, he was forced to sit and listen while Daniels recounted their alleged encounter in sometimes graphic detail. Speaking to reporters before and after each day in court, Trump launched regular tirades against Judge Juan Merchan - calling him \"corrupt\" and a \"tyrant\" - and condemned the whole trial as \"election interference\" by Democrats intent on keeping him off the campaign trail. The politics of the case were in full view in the final days when a coterie of leading Republicans - including several vice-presidential hopefuls - came to the court and stood behind Trump in a gesture of support as he spoke to the press. The judge has said he expects closing arguments to take up all of Tuesday. He will then give his final instructions to the jury, who will likely begin their deliberations on Wednesday. To return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires unanimity. Just one holdout means a hung jury and a mistrial. Aside from Daniels, the key prosecution witness was Michael Cohen, Trump's former \"fixer\" turned bitter foe who said he arranged the $130 000 hush money payment so her story \"would not affect Mr Trump's chances of becoming president of the United States\". Trump's defence team devoted most of their questioning trying to discredit Cohen, recalling that he had admitted lying to Congress and spent time in prison for tax fraud. In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He also faces charges in Florida of allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House. None of those trials are expected to take place before the November election.",

        "content": "For the first time in over a decade, 270 Syrians traveled on a direct flight early Tuesday from Damascus to Saudi Arabia for the annual Islamic Hajj pilgrimage, the Syrian Transportation Ministry said. The development is part of an ongoing thaw in relations between Damascus and Riyadh, which days ago appointed Saudi Arabia’s first ambassador to war-torn Syria since severing ties in 2012 . Syria was readmitted to the 22-member Arab League in 2023, after it had been suspended from the group for more than a decade over President Bashar Assad’s brutal crackdown on anti-government protesters in 2011. Most countries in the Arab world have since restored diplomatic ties with Damascus. A second plane of pilgrims is set to depart from Damascus to Jeddah late Tuesday, the ministry said. 1.8 million Muslims from around the world took part in last year’s Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, making it one of the world’s largest religious gatherings. This year, it’s scheduled to begin on the evening of June 14. The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and Muslims are required to undertake it at least once in their lives if they are physically and financially able to do so. The uprising-turned-civil war in Syria, now in its 14th year has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half of the country’s prewar population of 23 million. The war has largely remained frozen and so have the efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Poverty is rampant across the front lines, with aid dwindling and a growing number of countries sounding the alarm on surging migration. —— Associated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut contributed to this report.",

At InCred Capital, Agarwal will be at the helm of critical functions such as technology, operations, client servicing, compliance and risk management, the company said in a statement.

        "content": "Virgil van Dijk has revealed that while he has held talks with Arne Slot about his Liverpool future, he is not surprised the club is yet to open contract negotiations. 's current deal expires next summer and he would like to sign an extension. But while his future remains up in the air as things stands, the captain has confirmed that after speaking to his new head coach, he expects to remain with the Reds next season. “A new contract has not yet been discussed,” he admitted to . “That is not surprising, because the club was completely busy with the new trainer, the staff and everything. Then it doesn't make sense to start working with players. “Of course (I am open to contract talks). You can always talk and we will see how that will go. “I didn't know at all. This was the first conversation. That felt good. We discussed everything. About the selection, but also about my personal situation. But he also believes that the focus should now be entirely on the Dutch team. “I didn't have the feeling that this was a farewell conversation and I think he also sees me in Liverpool 2.0. I got the feeling that he is happy that I am still there and will be there next season, so that I can help him where necessary. This allows us to achieve success on the field.” Meanwhile, Van Dijk has also confirmed he will remain Liverpool captain under Slot and reacted further to Sipke Hulshoff joining the club as assistant head coach, having stepped down as Ronald Koeman’s assistant with the Netherlands prior to Euro 2024 to take up the position. \"I am and will remain captain,” he told . “I congratulated him (Slot), I am very happy for his family and him. “And of course also for Sipke Hulshoff. Great news for Sipke (to join Liverpool), but a shame he is not here.”",

        "content": "Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Congress party, accusing its members of having their hearts in Pakistan while residing in India. “Their (Congress leaders) bodies are in India, but their hearts are in Pakistan. The hearts of Congressmen beat for Pakistanis. Your (Congress) government is becoming impotent, and yet you claim you’ll open up the Wagah border,” Thakur said. Thakur further raised several questions regarding the Congress party’s stance on various issues including financial dealings with China through the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. “I want to ask Rahul Gandhi, what compulsion is there to praise Pakistan? What compulsion is there to take money from China through the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation? What compulsion is there to question the valour of our soldiers? What compulsion is there to work and feed off the 5 per cent quota for SC, ST, and OBC and why is this a compulsion for the Congress? My question is, what compulsion is there to trample on Sanatan Dharma and demolish the Ram Mandir? What compulsion does the Congress have to insult Hindus, demean India, and muzzle praise for Pakistan and China? What is the compulsion of the Congress party?” Thakur said. He criticized Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for her failure to champion women’s rights despite her slogans. “It was easy to give the slogan ‘I am a girl, I can fight’. But she never fought nor stood up for girls. Women were tortured, crimes were committed and they were also killed but Priyanka Gandhi was not seen,” Thakur said. Thakur also denounced the Himachal Pradesh government for its inaction in fulfilling promises made to women, highlighting the delay in disbursing funds. “Neha, the daughter of a Congress counsellor was murdered by strangulation for refusing to undergo forced marriage. Despite being in power, their councillor’s daughter did not get justice, but she did not catch anyone’s attention,” Thakur said. “Promises of Rs 1500 per month to women in Himachal Pradesh were made, but it’s been 16 months, and no face has been shown, nor have any women received a penny. Now, the CM there says he will provide money within 24 hours. Congress government has been asleep for 16 months. Now it’s time for your government to leave,” he added",

        "content": "This analytically summarises the key stories related to the Goods and Services Tax Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAR ) and Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAAR ) reported at Taxscan.in during the period from May 3, 2024 to May 24, 2024. The West Bengal Authority of Advance Ruling ( AAR ) has determined that a GST of 18% must be paid on the sum received by the applicant from Mercedes-Benz India as reimbursement for the “Loss on Sale of Demo Car.” It was noted that the funds received from Mercedes-Benz India as reimbursement for the “Loss on Sale of Demo Car” should be considered as payment received for providing services related to “agreeing to tolerate an act.” The Authority Bench of Tanisha Dutta and Joyjit Banik concluded that the applicant can indeed claim input tax credit on cars used for demonstration purposes and subsequently sold after a specified period. The Odisha Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAR ) ruled that sale of land and duplex construction on same land executing two separate agreements attracts an effective rate of 5% Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) after deducting 1/3 towards land cost from the total consideration. The Applicant sought clarification on the GST rate for the sale of land and construction of duplexes under separate agreements, and the admissibility of input tax credit. The bench of Abhay Gupta and P K Mohanty ruled that “in view of Notification No. 03/2019-C.T. (Rate) dated 29.03.2019, the Applicant is liable to pay GST @7.5% (CGST @3.75% + SGST @3.75%) after deducting l/3rd towards land cost from the total consideration i.e. effective rate of 5% GST on the full consideration received towards land and Duplex and is not eligible for ITC on any inward supply of goods and services.” Thus, the applicant is liable to pay an effective rate of 5% GST. The Mumbai bench of the Customs Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) ruled that the PVC raincoats are classifiable under the category of “Overcoats, Raincoats, and Similar Articles” as specified in the First Schedule of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. The bench found that the goods included the submissions made by the applicant during the course of personal hearing. I therefore proceed to decide the present applications regarding classification of “PVC raincoats” on the basis of the information on record as well as the existing legal framework having bearing on the classification of the products in question under the first schedule of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. Heading 6201 covers Men’s or boys’ overcoats, car-coats, capes, cloaks, anoraks (including ski-jackets), wind-cheaters, wind-jackets and similar articles, other than those of heading 6203. Heading 6203 covers Men’s or boys’ suits, ensembles, jackets, blazers, trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches and shorts (other than swimwear). Plain reading of these two headings makes it clear that heading 6201 is the most suitable heading to cover raincoat, moreover, CTI 6201 4010 specifically covers— Overcoats, raincoats, car-coats, capes, cloaks and similar articles (of man-made fibers) On the basis of foregoing discussions and findings, the single member bench of the tribunal comprising V.M Shobhan Sindhu (Asst. Commissioner of Customs and Secretary Customs Authority for Advance Ruling) ruled that the subject ‘PVC raincoats’ merit classification under CTH 6201 and more specifically under CTI 6201 4010 of the first schedule of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 The Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR), ruled that there was no Goods and Service Tax applicable on the supply of imported goods on a high seas sale basis, as it falls under Entry 8(b) of Schedule III of the Central Goods and Service Tax CGST Act, 2017. The two member bench comprising Riddesh Raval (Member SGST) and Amit Kumar Mishra (Member CGST) concluded that the transaction of sale of goods on high seas sale [HSS] basis by the applicant to IOCL in terms of Contract No. 44AC91 00-EPCC- I as has been held supra, is covered under entry 8(b) of Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017 and therefore the HSS supply was neither a supply of goods nor a spply of services. The Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAR ), ruled that restaurant service supplies are exclusively not eligible for Input Tax Credit ( ITC ), while other supplies remain exempted. The bench found that the first question on which ruling is sought is whether they are entitled to claim ITC of the expenses incurred for the general expenses of the Company which are meant for the purpose of business. Further found that explanation (iv) reproduced supra would come to play meaning thereby that credit of input tax charged on goods or services used exclusively in supplying restaurant service is not eligible. The Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAR ) ruled that the employer was eligible to avail Input Tax Credit ( ITC ) on the rooftop solar system, along with its installation and commissioning, under Section 17(5) of the Central Goods and Service Tax ( CGST ) Act. The bench stated that the provisions of both the CGST Act and the GGST Act are the same except for certain provisions. Therefore, unless a mention is specifically made to such dissimilar provisions, a reference to the CGST Act would also mean a reference to the same provisions under the GGST Act. The two member bench of the tribunal comprising Riddesh Raval (member SGST) and Amit Kumar Mishra (member CGST) concluded that applicant was eligible to avail ITC on roof top solar system with installation & commissioning under the CGST/GGST Act. The roof top solar system with installation and commissioning constitute plant and machinery of the applicant and hence is not blocked ITC under Section 17 (5) of the CGST/GGST Act. The Gujarat bench of the Authority for Advance Ruling ( AAR ) ruled that deducting from employee salaries for food provided within factory premises does not fall under the classification of ‘supply’ as per section 7 of the (Central Goods and Service Tax) CGST Act. The two member bench of the tribunal comprising Riddesh Raval (SGST member) and Amit Kumar Mishra (CGST member) ruled that deduction of amount by the applicant f-rom the salary of the employees who are availing facility of food provided in the factory premises would not be considered as a ‘supply’ under the provisions section 7 of the CGST Act, 2017 and the GGST Act, 2017. The West Bengal Authority of Advance Ruling ( AAR ) has held that the supply of disposable paper cups attracts 18% GST. It was observed that manufactured disposable paper cups are covered under HSN 4823-4000. The two-member bench of Tanisha Dutta and Joyjit Banik observed that it is covered under the description falling under Chapter, Heading, Sub-heading, or Tariff Item 4823, as specified in entry serial number 157 of Schedule-III of Notification No. 1/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated June 28, 2017 (as amended). The AAR held that the supply of disposable paper cups as manufactured by the applicant is covered under HSN 4823-4000 and would attract 18% GST. © 2024 Taxscan © 2024 Taxscan",

        "content": "Amid the soaring temperatures, Rajasthan is expected to witness a significant drop of 3-5 degrees Celsius in temperatures by the end of May, a senior official of IMD’s Rajasthan Meteorological Centre said on Tuesday. The Regional Meteorological Centre also indicated that severe heatwave conditions are likely to persist in the state for the next 48 hours. The temperatures in places like Phalodi, Barmer and Jaisalmer in West Rajasthan are continuously crossing the mark of 48 degrees Celsius, with no change expected until May 29. Radheshyam Sharma, Director, Meteorological Centre, Jaipur, said the maximum temperature will remain between 48 and 49 degrees Celsius and is unlikely to witness any significant change till May 29. However, the situation will modify in the next two to three days. “The severe heatwave conditions are likely to prevail in the state until May 29. From May 30, temperatures in East Rajasthan will decrease by 3-5 degrees Celsius, while in West Rajasthan, the intensity of the severe heatwave will significantly diminish. By the end of May, the maximum temperature in West Rajasthan will be around 45 degrees Celsius,” he said. Sharma further said, “However, due to some western disturbances, parts of the state, particularly West and Northwest Rajasthan, will experience thunderstorms and lightning accompanied by light rains and dusty winds. From June 1, the maximum temperatures are expected to range in the normal category.” Earlier, on Monday, Radheshyam Sharma, Director of Meteorological Centre, Jaipur, said the maximum temperature is unlikely to witness any significant change until May 29. “For the first time in this season, Phalodi in Rajasthan has crossed the temperature mark of 50 degrees Celsius, while places like Jaisalmer and Barmer have witnessed a surge of seven degrees Celsius in the night temperature. There is no immediate relief from the intense heatwave and warmer nights in the next two to three days. The maximum temperatures are unlikely to witness any significant changes until May 29,” he said. Sharma said there is a possibility of strong surface winds of “25-35 kmph in some parts of Jodhpur, Bikaner, Ajmer, and Jaipur divisions during the next 72 hours”. Large parts of northern India continue to reel under a fierce heat wave, with temperatures soaring over 45 degrees Celsius at many places in the country on Sunday",

        "content": "A portion of Kansas Street in Frankfort has closed to vehicular traffic, allowing restaurants to expand outdoor dining and kicking off a summer season that will feature improvements, events and new businesses to the historic downtown district. “It’s a fun atmosphere,” said Karen Meyers with This and That Gifts and Accessories, 11 S. White St. “We have so much going on in the summer.” Frankfort Mayor Keith Ogle said temporarily closing Kansas Street from Ash to Oak streets, first done during the COVID-19 pandemic, is back by popular demand. The closure creates a pedestrian friendly zone where visitors can dine al fresco, shop at the downtown’s unique boutiques and enjoy the summer season. “It’s straight out of a Hallmark movie,” Ogle said. The village has worked on a myriad of improvements to its downtown district, Ogle said. Two new downtown parking lots with 80 additional spaces are expected to be completed by June 1. The village secured $560,000 in grants from the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity for parking and lighting enhancements in the historic district, Ogle said. A new parking lot at 2 Smith St. is anticipated to open by June 1. This lot will have 42 new spaces with another lot under construction nearby on White Street adding 38 new spaces. (Michelle Mullins/for Daily Southtown) The future parking lot at 2 Smith St. once contained an abandoned cabinet factory that was torn down, said Sarah Hodges, resident engineer with Robinson Engineering, which is working on the project. The lots will provide much-needed space for visitors and events, she said. Plans are also underway for playground and path improvements at Prairie Park to create a more inviting and accessible outdoor space for families, village officials said. Three news restaurants, Senso Sushi, Rustic Knead and Nautical Bowls, and a children’s dentist are under construction in downtown Frankfort. They are expected to open in late July or Aug.. (Michelle Mullins/for Daily Southtown) Three restaurants, Senso Sushi, Rustic Knead and Nautical Bowls, as well as Growing Smiles children’s dentistry, are expected to open by late July or August on White Street, Ogle said. The businesses are generating a lot of excitement and will add to the downtown Frankfort district, he said. Senso Sushi plans for outdoor dining. Alex Masterson, owner of the Candle Vault, 114 Kansas St., opened her business in September, transforming a vacant bank built in 1885 to a boutique shop where patrons can create a custom-scented candle from among its 130 fragrance options. She has partnered with local artists who created handmade jars for the candles. Preserving the building’s history was important to her. Once a site of an 1899 bank heist in which thieves stole $1,900, the building contains the original floors, copper ceiling, front door and bank vault. It sat vacant for about 30 years before being revitalized, Masterson said. “We wanted to bring that building back to life,” she said. Candle Vault owner Alex Masterson stands outside the original vault from the 1885 bank. (Michelle Mullins/for Daily Southtown) Because the candles take time to set, she encourages her customers to visit other downtown Frankfort businesses before picking up their products. “I definitely think Frankfort has something special to offer,” Masterson said. Chris Hammar, owner of Hammar’s Mercantile, 4 W. Nebraska St., a home décor and gift shop, said the downtown has numerous woman-owned businesses, which help one another. The village does a good job planning events and attracting visitors to the downtown, she said. Shoppers on a bus tour from Naperville recently complimented the atmosphere and the shops in the historic district, Hammar said. “You can spend a great part of your day in downtown Frankfort,” Hammar said. Frankfort resident Emma Barnard, who was visiting the downtown district on a recent sunny afternoon, said she enjoys when the village closes the street for outdoor dining. The downtown offers something for everyone, she said. “I love how they keep the personality of old town Frankfort,” Barnard said. “It has timeless charm.” Layne Boyce of New Lenox said the year-round events bring people together. “It’s a good central hub for people,” Boyce said. Francesca’s Fortunato restaurant is located at the intersection of Kansas and Oak Streets which will close through Oct. for outdoor dining. (Michelle Mullins/for Daily Southtown) One of the big draws to the downtown will be the annual Concerts on the Greens, at 6:30 p.m. Sunday evenings from June 16 to Aug. 25 on Breidert Green at Kansas and White streets. Between 500 and 1,100 people attend the concerts each week, which feature a variety of music genres, said Jesse Herder, director of events with the Frankfort Chamber of Commerce. Car shows will be held from 5 to 8 p.m. Mondays from June 3 to Sept. 23 in the downtown. The 12th annual Bluegrass Festival, featuring more than 20 national, regional and local bands, is planned for July 13 and 14. The 56th annual Frankfort Fall Festival with carnival rides, entertainment and nationally-recognized arts and crafts fair will return Aug. 31 to Sept. 2. The Kansas Street closure will remain in effect until the week leading up to the Fall Festival. After the fest, it will close again so that al fresco dining can resume through October. John Cosgrove, owner of Trail’s Edge Brewing Co., 20 Kansas St., said it takes a small army to set up the wrought-iron fencing, Astroturf, tables and chairs and twinkling lights to create a charming outdoor atmosphere on Kansas Street. Customers come from throughout the south and southwest suburbs as well as from Bourbonnais, Peotone and Manteno, Cosgrove said. “It’s beautiful,” he said. “Everybody has flowers. It’s more walkable. People seem to be clamoring for it. It’s worth it.”",

        "content": "Port Adelaide champion Travis Boak has admitted he’s the “most confused” he’s been across his 18-year career with the holding the ball adjudication as debate rages on. Discussion around the holding the ball rule has been a hot topic in recent weeks amid umpires’ reluctance to award such free kicks including AFL coaches Damien Hardwick and Michael Voss expressing frustration over the weekend. Speaking on Fox Footy’s AFL 360 on Tuesday night, Boak conceded he was also at a loss on where the rule sits.

Set a deposit limit. “I think I’d fail with flying colours (an exam on holding the ball),” Boak admitted. “If you asked me the question: ‘What is holding the ball?’, I don’t think I could answer it clearly right now, to be honest. “In the 18 years I’ve been in the league, this is probably the most confused I’ve been with the rule holding the ball.” AFL - Port Adelaide v Hawthorn at Adelaide Oval. Umpire calls the end of the game - Travis Boak after the loss. Picture Sarah Reed Source: News Corp Australia Injured Carlton veteran Sam Docherty said he was “on the same lens as fans” in not knowing what’s going to be penalised and what’s not. “The one that gets me is basically not disposing of the ball at all, or just because you’re making an attempt, that’s deemed OK,” Docherty said on AFL 360 . “It’s a tough rule to know what to expect on game day and it seems to change week to week.” One incident from the weekend has drawn the ire of the footy world, where Mac Andrew span Charlie Curnow around in a tackle instead of pulling him to the ground to avoid causing injury. However Andrew wasn’t given a free kick for holding the ball, with Curnow eventually kicking the ball after having ample prior opportunity. Docherty sympathised for the officials, noting it’s a “hard game to umpire”. “It’s such a hard one to know what’s accepted and what’s not,” Docherty said. “I know in a lot of other sports, they’ve banned that drop knee tackle. In the NFL, there’s heaps of injuries caused by that. “Last year or the year before, we lost our mind because (spinning) 360 was prior and everyone hated that. Inevitably it got changed. “The hard thing with the rule is we’re trying to find exact black and white science for every individual case and they’re so hard and so different. “I find it hard in this quest for black and white we try and get away from all the grey area that is AFL footy. The things that happen in our game are so different week to week. “People come from everywhere, it’s a 360 (degrees) sport and so many different things are happening with so many different layers to every decision.” Coaches open up on ball holding drama | 03:25 AFL 360 co-host Gerard Whateley named four levers he believes could be “pulled immediately” without needing to change rules. “There’s blowing the whistle earlier on the standing tackle to marry up with what the tribunal has demanded of the players,” he said. “Police no genuine attempt on the player who’s just lying on the ball cuddling it, you still have to make a genuine attempt. “There’s a difference between a ball being knocked out in a tackle and the player dropping the ball at the first sign of contact. “And then what represents illegal disposal once you have had prior? Be more vigilant on the players who have had prior and are taking on the tackle.” Whateley concluded the above tweaks would “double the number of holding the balls inside a game”. “Abandon the principle to keep the ball in motion, that’s nonsense,” he said. “Police the rule, it’s an excellent rule. The game is far better when holding the ball is paid. “You don’t have to tip to rewarding the tackler and putting the balance out of whack with the ball carrier. Just police what’s there and it can be done far more vigilantly.”",

        "content": "Amidst heightened concerns over potential interference in India’s upcoming general elections, Seqrite, the enterprise arm of global cybersecurity solutions provider, Quick Heal Technologies Limited, has uncovered an alarming escalation in cyberattacks orchestrated by Pakistan-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) groups targeting crucial Indian government and military entities. Seqrite’s elite APT research team has been meticulously monitoring these malicious campaigns, unveiling critical insights into the ever-evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the adversaries. At the forefront of these attacks is SideCopy, a formidable Pakistan-based APT group that has persistently targeted South Asian countries, with a laser-focus on compromising Indian defense and government organisations since at least 2019. In recent weeks alone, Seqrite has detected three distinct campaigns launched by this group, each characterized by the deployment of two instances of the AllaKore remote access trojan (RAT) as the final malicious payload. Simultaneously, Transparent Tribe (APT36), SideCopy’s overarching parent APT entity, has been relentlessly utilizing advanced variants of the Crimson RAT, a sophisticated .NET-based remote access tool designed for extensive system control and persistent access. Transparent Tribe has consistently targeted India since its emergence in 2013. The intensifying cyberattack campaigns spearheaded by these Pakistani APT groups represent a severe and escalating threat to our national security, especially in light of the ongoing general elections. Seqrite’s findings not only expose the cutting-edge offensive tactics being leveraged by the adversaries but also unveil the deep-rooted connections between different threat groups. This necessitates a coordinated and proactive cybersecurity posture across all critical infrastructure to safeguard the integrity of our democratic processes. The infection chains dissected by Seqrite typically commence with carefully crafted spear-phishing emails delivering malicious attachments or links that exploit vulnerabilities to gain initial footholds within target networks. Once compromised, these entry points are then leveraged to deploy an array of malware payloads, including the AllaKore and Crimson RATs, granting the attackers extensive remote control and unfettered access to infected systems. Through its comprehensive analysis, Seqrite has uncovered significant code overlaps and shared infrastructure between SideCopy and Transparent Tribe, further reinforcing the direct connection between these groups. The research also exposed APT36’s adoption of obfuscation techniques like .NET Reactor to enhance the evasiveness and persistence of their malware implants. The persistent targeting of Indian government and defense entities by Pakistani APT groups is not a new phenomenon. However, the recent surge in attack volumes and the escalating sophistication of the adversaries’ TTPs, particularly in the run-up to the general elections, represent a substantial escalation in the evolving cyber threat landscape faced by the nation. Seqrite strongly advices organisations especially those involved in the electoral process, to implement robust cybersecurity measures as an immediate priority. This includes ensuring regular software updates, deploying advanced email filtering and web security solutions, and conducting comprehensive security awareness training to educate employees on identifying and mitigating social engineering tactics. Furthermore, Seqrite recommends the adoption of multi-factor authentication mechanisms, the conduct of regular security assessments and penetration testing exercises, and the establishment of comprehensive incident response plans to minimize the potential impact of successful breaches. For an in-depth analysis of the recent infection chains, decoy documents, malware payloads, and IoCs associated with SideCopy and Transparent Tribe’s campaigns, please refer to Seqrite’s detailed threat research whitepaper available at https://www.seqrite.com/blog/pakistani-apts-escalate-attacks-on-indian-gov-seqrite-labs-unveils-threats-and-connections/ About Seqrite Seqrite is a leading enterprise cybersecurity solutions provider.

        "content": "Football fans can net themselves a free pint tomorrow (Wednesday, May 29) - but you'll need to prove your football knowledge ahead of a big summer of sport. The offer comes as a nationwide survey by Greene King Brewery reveals nearly one in five people admit to not knowing any football lingo at all. Proving one of the most troublesome phrases, almost three in four Brits are unfamiliar with the modern 'false nine' position, which has inspired Greene King’s brand-new False Nine golden ale. The position refers to a striker who operates in a deeper role than usual, linking the play with the midfield to the wide areas or helping the team progress up the pitch. To celebrate the launch of the new drink, Greene King will be giving away free pints of False Nine across 532 pubs nationwide, but only if punters can name a false nine player. Its UK-wide survey voted Lionel Messi, Phil Foden, Johan Cruyff, Roberto Firmino and Francesco Totti as the top five best players of all time in that position. False Nine is available now in selected pubs and will be right up to the Euro 2024 final on July 14. Will Hemmings, Marketing Director for Brewing & Brands at Greene King, said: \"We are delighted to launch our new False Nine beer, in perfect time for this summer’s football. \"To celebrate the launch, we’re going to be giving away the pint for free for one day only in selected Greene King Pubs, but only to those that can prove their football knowledge by naming a false nine player, including those voted the top five players by our nationwide survey. \"All pub-goers need to do is give the name of a false nine player at the bar when purchasing the drink, then they can claim at no cost at all. We’re hoping this will give Brits the taste of False Nine ahead of the big games, meaning punters across the nation can enjoy the drink throughout the tournament as they toast to England and Scotland!\" The participating Cheshire pubs NEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive email direct to your inbox here",

        "content": "Man Utd are likely to decide on the future of Erik ten Hag “at some point this week”, according to ESPN reporter Mark Ogden. The Red Devils had a brilliant first season under Ten Hag, winning the Carabao Cup, reaching an FA Cup final and securing a top-four finish in the Premier League. This campaign ended well with Ten Hag’s side unexpectedly beating arch-rivals Man City at Wembley to win the FA Cup final on Saturday . However, it doesn’t completely make up for a terrible season in which they finished eighth in the Premier League and crashed out of Europe before Christmas. Ten Hag could still face the sack, according to reports on Monday , but support is growing for the Dutchman from the some parts of the Man Utd hierarchy. And now ESPN journalist Ogden insists that Ten Hag’s future at Man Utd will “probably be resolved at some point this week”. Speaking on the Back Pages podcast, Ogden said : “Yeah, Erik ten Hag has known, probably since February, that his position was on the line. INEOS and Manchester United haven’t really distanced themselves from the stories that many of us have written, saying they’ve been assessing other candidates. “Gareth Southgate, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Kieran McKenna, Mauricio Pochettino – all these names have been put to United and they’ve not really been knocked back. So there’s been a process going on to to identify whether there’s a manager out there who can do a better job than ten Hag. Now I think that process will probably be resolved at some point this week.” And transfer expert Fabrizio Romano also brought an update on the situation at Old Trafford, he wrote in his Caught Offside column : “We’re at an important point of the story with the Manchester United manager situation. They are still talking internally about what to do with Erik ten Hag and it will take some time, but, again, [Kieran] McKenna is no longer on their list even if he was a name being considered. “Sir Jim Ratcliffe is also involved in the discussions and we know they have made contacts with several managers, holding talks with several agents to make sure they have options in case they decide to part ways with Ten Hag. Now it’s on Man United to make a decision and it’s important to note that the new owners will have a say.

So we have to be patient on this one.

Seals, which prevent fluid migration in reservoirs, are vital for oil and gas operations. The market growth is driven by increasing energy demand, oil and gas exploration, and the use of hydraulic fracturing. Download PDF Sample@ https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A16099 Market Dynamics The demand for cost-effective, environmentally friendly solutions, high-performance materials, and maintenance of aging infrastructure also propels market growth. However, stringent regulations and high production costs pose challenges, limiting entry for smaller companies and reducing competition, which can lead to higher prices for end-users. Market Segmentation The market is segmented by type, material, application, and region: By Type: Single processing seals and double processing seals. Double processing seals, which handle high pressure and temperature and prevent spills, are expected to grow fastest due to their effectiveness and safety compliance. By Material: Metal, elastomers, and face materials. Metal seals, dominating in 2021, are used in high-temperature environments and offer resistance to corrosion, extreme temperatures, and radiation. By Application: Upstream, midstream, and downstream. The downstream segment, which includes refining and distribution, dominated the market in 2021 due to the need for reliable sealing solutions in harsh chemical environments. By Region: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. Asia-Pacific is projected to grow fastest, driven by industrial investments and new oil and gas discoveries, particularly in China and India. COVID-19 Impact The pandemic significantly impacted the market, reducing demand for oil and gas products due to lockdowns and travel restrictions. Supply chain disruptions, particularly from China, led to a decline in production. Government funding shifts towards healthcare also slowed new project setups. Key Players Key market players include MG Sealing Limited, BRUSS Sealing Systems GmbH, Cooper Standard, Daetwyler Holding Inc., Dana Limited, ElringKlinger AG, Flowserve Corporation, Freudenberg Sealing Technologies, GARLOCK FAMILY OF COMPANIES, and KLINGER Holding GmbH. Key Benefits for Stakeholders The report offers quantitative analysis, market trends, and dynamics from 2021 to 2031. It highlights opportunities, drivers, and restraints, with Porter's five forces analysis to help stakeholders make informed business decisions.

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 SingHaiyi is set to introduce a new premium residential development at the Jurong Lake District, teaming up with Nakano Singapore (Nakano), a well-established contractor with a nearly 50-year track record of delivering top-notch projects in Singapore, for the Sora project. Located in the expansive Jurong Lake District, the largest mixed-use business area outside the city center, Sora aims to provide an exceptional living experience characterized by peace, convenience, and high-quality comfort. “Aligned with the Jurong Lake District’s transformation to become an integrated hub for live-work-play-learn, our aim is for Sora to offer its owners a premium lifestyle with a fine balance between nature and recreation. SingHaiyi’s commitment to homeowners transcends design and lifestyle to quality and peace of mind. Hence, it was a natural fit with Nakano, known for its consistency in delivering exceptional quality in their works. We look forward to leveraging their expertise to bring out the best in Sora,” said Mr Raymond Chia, Group Chief Executive Officer of SingHaiyi. Commitment to Excellence Amidst Challenges The construction industry faced significant setbacks during the COVID-19 pandemic, grappling with soaring costs and unpredictable supply chain disruptions. These challenges made it difficult for contractors to commit to new project timelines and budgets. Throughout this tumultuous period, Nakano adopted a prudent strategy, prioritizing the completion of projects already underway before the pandemic began. In spite of these adverse conditions, Nakano’s dedication to delivering exceptional quality never wavered. They successfully completed high-profile projects like the Artyzen Singapore Hotel on Cuscaden Road and the One North Eden condominium at one-north gateway, both of which continue to garner widespread acclaim. “Once we saw some normalcy returning and the market turbulence easing in 2023, we re-engaged the built environment market boldly and explored various opportunities, including placing more emphasis on residential projects, which is our forte. We take pride in being one of the few Japanese contractors in Singapore who have delivered residential projects consistently over the decades, among our diverse range of project types, and are therefore thrilled to collaborate with SingHaiyi for the Sora project as we find great synergy with them in our ethos to create high quality developments for our clients and consumers. We look forward to a fruitful journey as we deliver 440 beautiful homes for the Sora residents,” said Mr Kutsuzawa Yoichi, Managing Director of Nakano Singapore. Positioned on Yuan Ching Road, Sora is set to rise on the site previously occupied by Park View Mansions. The ground-breaking event took place on April 29, 2024. The Sora Gallery, situated on Prinsep Street, is scheduled to open its doors to the public on June 22, 2024.",

Dr. Yasir Adnan shared that every 5 minutes, someone, somewhere in the world is diagnosed with MS. Currently, there are more than 2.8 million people living with MS around the world. Although, there is no MS registry in Pakistan, it is estimated that there are more than 10,000 MS sufferers nationwide. In light of the growing burden of MS across the country, he stated that a disease like MS poses not only debilitating physical and health challenges for the sufferer, but also grave challenges for the families of sufferers and for society. Dr. Shahid Mustafa acknowledged that while it can take time for someone to even get an MS diagnosis, it was critical to get a diagnosis and subsequent treatment as early as possible. He stated that MS was not only a disabling disease, but also a stigmatizing disease leading to social isolation and exclusion. As a healthcare professional, he also believed that it was important to advocate for better MS training and awareness in healthcare settings so patients receive the right information and care. Dr. Muhammad Wasay said that Multiple Sclerosis was a disabling disease largely affecting young people especially women. Disability related to MS could be reduced by early and effective treatment. Unfortunately, he said most MS patients could not afford disease modifying therapy so government support for treatment was critical. He urged the Sindh government to come forward and support MS patients so that they could become productive members of society. Ms. Hafsa Shamsie emphasized that for a nation it was important to solve the health problems of women – especially since MS was about 2 to 3 times more common in women than men. She believed gender should not be a barrier to treatment. MS deprived young women of a chance of a normal life unless they received treatment, leaving some of them wheelchair bound for the rest of their lives. Ms. Hafsa Shamsie said that Roche was a company that prided itself on finding answers to the world’s most complex health issues and those where it saw the greatest unmet need. That is why Roche was not only committed to serving MS patients by bringing innovative treatments, but from 2017, Roche has run a Patient Support Program that has helped over 25,000 patients with free of cost treatment for a number of diseases including MS. But as the burden of disease grows no one company or entity can go it alone and the government coming forward to support MS patients and include them in public health funding was critical.",

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Celtics improved to 4-0 in crunch time games during this postseason run after Monday’s 105-102 Game 4 win over the Pacers. The visitors trailed by eight points with just under six minutes remaining in regulation before closing the game out with a 15-4 run to secure their spot in the NBA Finals. Derrick White was one of the heroes of the night after hitting the game-winning 3-point jumper in the corner. After the win, he reflected on Boston’s ability to stay composed in those big spots after rallying for three wins late in their series win over the Pacers, pointing out a unique tool Joe Mazzulla had used to help them. “We feel confident,” White said..” It starts in practice, the championship stations that Joe loves to do, it starts there. And just continue to trust one another. So we feel comfortable in any type of game and we feel like we’ve got the answers for anything that teams throw at us no matter what the scenario is, and we just got to find the right ones.” Jayson Tatum shed some more light on the championship stations that Mazzulla uses after his 33-point night. “It’s the little things that we talk about that can help you win a championship,” Tatum said. “Defensive rebounding, crashing the glass on the offense, communicating and just little things we do every single day that can take you a long way.” Boston struggled in these spots in past postseasons, suffering several blown leads and near losses after late-game collapses. Some of those struggles have lingered in tight games during the regular season but Boston’s core has appeared to turn a new leaf during this postseason run. ‘ll give credit to our coaching staff,” Jaylen Brown said. “We were very organized. This year, we went over a lot of late-game situations and stuff like that. We’re always trying to think the game. We got to be in those situations. Everybody talks about what our late-game offense looks like, and I thought we got some great opportunities in this series to display that. We came out on top, so that was great.” “I think Joe’s pretty good at, I wouldn’t say predicting situations, but kind of putting this in awkward situations or situations that are very, very possible,” Jrue Holiday added. “The last two games we were down eight with two minutes left, and I think to be able to manage the game, having Derrick White out there manage the game, and then JT and JB kind of take over, it’s exactly what Joe was talking about. I think we have the mindset and the character for it, and then we just went out there and showed it.”",

As decarbonization efforts gain momentum, point-source CO 2 capture technology is attracting more attention BOULDER, Colo., May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A new report from Guidehouse Insights examines advanced carbon capture solutions providers in commercial-scale point-source capture applications. As efforts to decarbonize become widespread, point-source carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture technology is growing in popularity, especially for hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as industry and power generation. As a result, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a growing industry, both in project development and in policy support mechanisms. According to Guidehouse Insights, Shell Catalysts & Technologies/Technip Energies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Honeywell Universal Oil Products are the leading carbon capture solutions providers. \"Today's CCUS industry is more global, unbundled, and horizontally integrated, with numerous projects, including industrial hub or cluster-based approaches with multiple emitters, and those with CO 2 largely destined for storage rather than utilization applications,\" says Serkan Birgel , research analyst with Guidehouse Insights. \"However, market deployment progress has been slow, as has progress toward reaching net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050.\" In more mature markets such as Europe and North America , current barriers have rendered progress in reaching final investment decisions slower than expected. Still, growth of the CCUS industry is accelerating, and the competitive space is subject to change as vendor projects and technologies mature, merger and acquisition activity grows, and policies and legislation change, according to the report. The report, Guidehouse Insights Leaderboard: Advanced Point-Source Carbon Capture Solutions Providers , assesses advanced carbon capture solutions providers in commercial-scale point-source capture applications, where CO 2 is captured at the point of emissions as a part of a contemporary commercial CCUS project. It identifies and ranks eight successful carbon capture solution providers with projects in commercial operation or advanced commercial development that cumulatively capture at least 1.5 million metric tons of CO 2 per year.

        "description": "Another 80-degree day on tap for Boston and much of the area.",
        "content": "A quick-moving system brought rain and thunderstorms into New England late Monday into the overnight hours, with a few areas seeing nearly 2 inches of rainfall . Boston has seen just under a half inch — 0.41 inches. The bulk of the rain has already passed over Boston before sunrise, leaving a few lingering spot showers and patches of morning fog in the storm’s wake as you get ready for the morning commute. Once the system moves away, clouds will begin to thin and break up Tuesday morning as the front begins to filter in dry, more comfortable air into the area. Skies will begin to turn from overcast to partly and mostly sunny as the day goes on. It will be a warm day across the city with temperatures likely to break into the 80s, a jump of around 10 degrees from Monday. You’ll feel the difference in the air by the time you head home, with dew points dropping back into the 50s. Winds will remain from the southwest at a modest 5 to 10 miles per hour, but daytime heating will mean a pop-up shower or two in the afternoon mainly west of the city. However, Boston can’t be ruled out of a quick evening sprinkle. With the overnight storm passing, Boston has tallied 3.34 inches of rain this month. The total monthly average for May is 3.25 inches — with one more system possible to pass before the month concludes, this will make May slightly above the average, with May 8 as the rainiest day of the month with 0.69 inches. Boston has seen 17.20 inches of rain so far this year — still pacing 6.18 inches above average. On Wednesday, another quick-moving front will bring the chance for scattered showers ahead of a dominant high-pressure system that is likely set up the second half of the week to be mostly sunny and seasonal — to what should be a likely completely dry, seasonable weekend. Advertisement Southern New England: The majority of the rain has passed during nighttime hours, setting up a soggy start to the day as much of the area begins to dry out. There may be a couple of pockets of light showers, drizzle, and fog, but things start to dry out rather quickly today. Temperatures are likely to reach into the 80s this afternoon with the return of the sun after the storm exits and Worcester, Providence, Canton, Leominster, Lowell and Andover are all in the mix. Winds stay below 10 mph while a pop-up shower this afternoon or evening may be possible. Western Mass.: The drying out process is already underway at sunrise with more sun than clouds expected as the day goes on. Temperatures reach the mid-70s across the mountainous Berkshires, with the valleys passing 80, including Springfield, Longmeadow and Hartford. There’s the chance for a spot shower or thunderstorm later this evening but should be hit or miss. Winds stay under 10 mph with dew points dropping to comfortable readings. Cape and Islands: There may be some pockets of showers lingering over the peninsula by daybreak, but they quickly exit. Temperatures continue to remain cooler by the abutting Atlantic, reaching the upper 60s for most. Winds will be from the southwest at 15 mph for a continued breeze. Skies go from overcast to a mix of sun and clouds, then to mostly sunny. Advertisement Northern New England: Parts of Northern New England saw the heaviest of rain with some areas seeing around two inches or more The system exits eastern Maine this morning but the rest of the area is already drying out. Sunshine will filter across the three northern states with some clouds mixed in. Temperatures will rise to the upper 70s and low 80s with a steady southwesterly flow to 10 mph. Vermont may be in line for a spot afternoon shower or thunderstorm, but they should be short lived if they do materialize. Ken Mahan can be reached at ken.mahan@globe.com .

I really don’t think I would have said that to you, not out loud. Especially the part about your tight dress being so far up your coochie it would make a porn star blush.” Marchesi went on to clarify that she did of course remember the several occasions upon which she told her daughter that girls who dressed like that were just asking for trouble.",

Here are three great Nasdaq stocks to buy this month you may of never heard of.The post If You Can Only Buy One Nasdaq Stock in May, It Better Be One of These 3 Names appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Operating over 29 markets and centered in New York, the Nasdaq was the world’s first automated stock exchange. With 2,500 companies+ on the Nasdaq and heavy exposure to the technology industry, it is no wonder that many companies in many investors’ portfolios are brimming with companies trading on this exchange. Secular trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing have all been major factors in driving many tech companies, and thus the Nasdaq’s corresponding stock (NASDAQ: NDAQ ). However, not all investors simply like investing in broader indexes. For more risk-tolerant investors dedicated to due diligence and research, single stock picks within the exchange can offer much higher profitability and return. As such, in this article, we’ve highlighted three great Nasdaq stocks to buy that all investors should keep on their radar. Textron (TXT) Textron (NASDAQ: TXT ) is an innovative aerospace and defense company that is best known for its global product lineup of brands including Cessna, Beechcraft, and Bell. Currently, Yahoo! Finance analysts are projecting a one-year price range between an average of $99.62 and a high of $121. In TXT’s recent Q1 earnings , management provided positive financial guidance, balanced out by macro tailwinds such as inflationary cost pressures and supply chain disruptions. Thankfully, they have also noted a reacceleration of TXT’s Bell helicopter, which has reflected the resurgence of demand from commercial and military end markets. Valuation-wise, the recent underperformance in the recent quarter has left Textron to remain a relatively undervalued company with a 15.41x P/E as opposed to its sector median of 19.84x . However, analysts are already expecting recovery with a $3.56 billion revenue and $1.50 EPS target. As Textron continues to balance operational challenges with secular market shifts, investors should consider scooping up shares of this Nasdaq stock to buy before company makes its rebound. GigaCloud Technology (GCT) GigaCloud Technology (NASDAQ: GCT ) is a company offering a technology-driven business-to-business platform that specializes in servicing large parcel e-commerce and retail customers. Despite nearly 400% price growth, Wall Street analysts’ one-year price target is $52.33 on average to a high of $69. Gigacloud’s top-line results have largely been attributed to its commitment to accretive acquisitions and constant improvements in accelerating and strengthening its marketplace services. Currently, Gigacloud is integrating its Noblehouse and Wondersign acquisitions to create revenue synergies and more robust marketplace services. GCT’s addition of its new Branding-as-a-Service has also added to management’s optimism in amplifying GCT’s product’s competitiveness. In GCT’s most recent earnings call, it saw TTM marketplace GMV increase by 64% YOY and total revenues nearly double. Surprisingly, GCT’s valuations have stayed quite discounted at a P/E ratio of 12.6x , compared to its sector median of 17.8x. For investors looking for some exposure to e-commerce, this should be a top pick from the Nasdaq stocks to buy. Honeywell (HON) Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON ) is a diversified manufacturing and technology company that is focusing on automation, aerospace, and energy transition, as of recent. Yahoo! Finance reports that 16 analysts predict Honeywell’s one-year price range to fall between an average of $219 and a high of $250. In the company’s recent earnings, HON saw a solid start to the year and exceeded its first-quarter EPS expectations. Management detailed that while long-term aerospace and energy businesses saw expected healthy organic growth. The short-cycle portfolio was also showing signs of recovery. Looking forward, the evolution of its Honeywell Accelerator will be one of the biggest growth drivers for HON, delivering incremental value and deploying world-class customer experiences. Looking at the financials, we see that HON has leveraged AI to cut costs and maintain strong margins at 20%. Overall, while Honeywell’s P/E valuation sits at a more fair value that hovers around its sector median. Its dominance as a cheaper dividend growth company is bound to attract any investor looking to round out their portfolio.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLithium prices may finally be bottoming out, creating an opportunity for some of the top lithium stocks to buy now.The post If You Can Only Buy One Lithium Stock in May, It Better Be One of These 3 Names appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Lithium prices may finally be bottoming out, creating an opportunity for some of the top lithium stocks to buy now. For one, according to Canaccord Genuity lithium prices are “poised to rebound by July.” “ Canaccord says it’s more confident in its current view that lithium has bottomed than it was last May due to production prices for lithium carbonate equivalent recently falling across several producers,” they added, according to NorthernMiner.com . Two, as noted in Lithium Royalty Corp.’s (OTCMKTS: LITRF ) latest earnings report , “lithium prices appeared to reach a bottom during the quarter with prices firming up in March. Current market prices for spodumene are trading approximately 25% higher than the lows seen in January and February this year as demand signals continue to firm up led by growth from China.” Three, according to Statista , by 2030, global demand for lithium is expected to pass 2.4 metric tons, which doubles the demand forecast for 2025. All of which tell us it’s time to pick up beaten-down lithium stocks to buy, including: Albemarle (ALB) After pulling back from $137.50, Albemarle (NYSE: ALB ) again found support at $124.31 and bounced back to $127.60. From here, I’d like to see ALB initially retest $137.50, especially with lithium prices finally bottoming out. Making ALB even more attractive as another one of the top lithium stocks to buy, it recently declared a dividend of 40 cents, payable on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 14. Helping, the electric vehicle market is showing signs of life again, according to the International Energy Agency. “Every other car sold globally in 2035 is set to be electric based on today’s energy, climate and industrial policy settings, as reflected in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario. This has significant impacts on the car fleet. As soon as 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is electric in this scenario, and almost one in five in both the United States and European Union,” noted the IEA . With these growing catalysts, I’d like to see ALB closer to $200 again near term. Sociedad Quimia Y Minera (SQM) I’d also use weakness in Sociedad Quimica Y Minera (NYSE: SQM ) as an opportunity. After finding support at $42.50, SQM ran back to $49.46. Now, if it can break above resistance at around $51, it could potentially retest $62. Also, while we wait for the recovery, we can collect its $0.2134 quarterly dividend, payable May 28 to shareholders of record as of May 10. Granted, recent earnings weren’t so hot. Its earnings per share loss of $3.04 missed by $1.46. Revenue of $1.08 billion, down 55.2% year over year missed by $60 million. But that’s to be expected when lithium prices plunge as they have. However, the company did revise and increased its lithium sales volume guidance. “We believe that the strong demand growth in lithium market seen since the beginning of the year could continue for the remainder of the year, with total lithium demand surpassing 1.1 million metric tons during 2024,” said SQM CEO Ricardo Ramos . “Given this positive trend in demand growth, especially in China which accounts for almost 75% of global lithium demand, and our updated sales volumes outlook for the year, we believe that our sales volumes could reach 200,000 metric tons in 2024,” he added. Piedmont Lithium (PLL) The last time I mentioned Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL ), I noted: “The company just secured its much-anticipated North Carolina mining permit. With that, according to Piedmont Lithium President and CEO Keith Phillips , ‘We plan to develop Carolina Lithium as one of the lowest-cost, most sustainable lithium hydroxide operations in the world, and as a critical part of the American electric vehicle supply chain.'” That was on May 2, as PLL traded at $12.20. Today, after testing $16.59, PLL is now trading at $14.50, and is still a strong buy opportunity. Earnings weren’t too hot here either, with lithium prices down. The EPS loss was 61 cents, missing expectations by 73 cents. Revenue of $13.4 million missed by $1.28 million. However, with lithium prices bottoming out, electric vehicle sales accelerating, and its approved project in North Carolina, I’d like to see PLL double, if not triple from its current undervalued price of $14.50.

        "content": "May 28 2024 The Money Advice Trust’s National Debtline has helped an additional 8,200 people with free, independent debt advice since September thanks to its latest targeted advertising and media campaign, built on Experian insights. Many people continue to feel pressure caused by rising bills, but findings from National Debtline show a third of callers wait a year or more before seeking advice for their debts, often deepening their problems and worsening the impact on their mental health. In September 2023, the leading debt advice charity launched a new targeted campaign, aimed at driving engagement and awareness of its National Debtline service amongst those who may need free, impartial support with debt problems. Using insights derived from Experian, the charity was able to better inform key aspects of its campaign, including identifying areas with higher concentrations of people dealing with money problems, using this insight to help reach people in need of debt advice more widely.

        "content": "If you’ve been following the sustainability efforts of major luxury fashion players, you’ll be aware of the significant strides made by the global luxury group, Kering, since its inception in 1963. Today, the group oversees the development of fashion, leather goods and jewellery brands such as Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Boucheron. Under the leadership of chief sustainability and institutional affairs officer Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering has revolutionised best practices for sustainable fashion. Prior to her involvement in the fashion industry, however, Daveu had an illustrious career in agriculture and environmental matters. To date, she has worked with the French government, serving as chief of staff for the minister of ecology and as the technical adviser to the prime minister. She assumed her role at Kering in 2012. During her tenure, Daveu has overseen the development of the group’s Environmental Profit And Loss (EP&L) account, a tool that measures the environmental impact of its operations. Additionally, she has overseen the conceptualisation of the Material Innovation Lab in Milan, a dedicated hub to the sourcing and creation of sustainable fabrics and materials. Daveu’s visit to Singapore marks a three-year research collaboration with the Centre of Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School. As an incentive to combat climate change, NUS is looking to conceptualise concrete remedies. This is set to be implemented in three phases: two blocks of nature-related obstacles and one on climate adaptation. The ultimate goal? To provide data with regard to present-day nature and climate practices and spotlight deficiencies. In an exclusive interview with Vogue Singapore, Daveu expands on the biggest fashion and textile pollutants, the definition of a truly sustainable brand as well as the meaning of impact. Hi Marie-Claire, what brings you to Singapore? Kering is starting a new three-year partnership with the Centre of Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School and it will be focused on our ecosystem, biodiversity and nature. So why Singapore? When you are in the fashion and luxury industry, nature is key because most of our raw materials come from there, such as leather, gold, precious stones and cashmere. For ethical reasons, it’s important to have a positive impact on biodiversity. And on the business side, without raw materials, we can’t do anything. Singapore is able to manage its urban side with its natural side, which I think is unique. And the National University of Singapore plays a key role in Asia Pacific to set trends in biodiversity and the environment. You’ve had an illustrious career within the domain of sustainability. What first piqued your interest in this sector? I was always passionate about animals and their welfare, which is what prompted me to study biology. I also wanted to work for the public sector because in France, the public sector plays an important role in defining policies. When I started my first job, we had to push a lot even when we were speaking about climate change. Unfortunately, now, because we see the consequences of climate change, there is finally a big shift all over the world. Kering is a leader in the luxury fashion industry when it comes to advocating for sustainability. The company’s EP&L is a great example of this. What are some of the benefits of some of the systems that have been put in place? There are many different answers to this. Firstly, when Kering’s chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault decided 20 years ago to put sustainability at the arc of the company, it was for ethical reasons. Because we are in luxury fashion, we set the trends and have the responsibility to raise awareness. Secondly, even though we are a big company, we are not big enough to change the paradigm alone. This is why we have to open source all our best practices, such as the methodology for EP&L. When I joined the company, people were saying that luxury is about fur. And thanks to François-Henri Pinault, we are the first group to have banned fur. It’s what we call modern luxury. It’s about savoir faire, heritage and quality. What are some of the biggest pollutants from the fashion and textile industry in 2024? It’s about overproduction, which creates leftover waste. Furthermore, there’s overconsumption of materials, which impacts pollution, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly significant when discussing the textile industry as different segments operate differently. Luxury segments, for instance, prioritise small volumes. It’s therefore interesting to note that the fashion industry as a whole is undergoing significant transformation. This is evident in initiatives like Fashion Pact, which includes fast fashion, sport brands and luxury brands, all committed to driving change. This brings us to the France-Singapore forum, Nature In The City. What is your aim for this? The first thing we want to do is to start a conversation. This partnership will last three years, so we have a short time frame. Perhaps you’ve already seen the results of the first report which is a map and diagnosis of how businesses and companies are paying attention to biodiversity in Asia Pacific. This report aims to raise awareness and demonstrate that many other businesses, not just in the luxury or textile industry, are heavily reliant on nature. In the future, for example, we’ll organise workshops, bringing together students and people from the business side. As a partner, Kering will be involved in this, too, to consider how we can support companies in implementing action and raising awareness among individuals who will eventually join companies and institutions. One thing that Kering has dedicated itself to is its Material Innovation Lab. Can you tell us more about this? Our textile-focused hub opened in 2013 in Italy with dual aims: enhancing sustainability through raw material selection and fostering disruptive innovations. The Material Innovation Lab now offers over 8,000 samples, enabling designers to incorporate more sustainable materials into their creations. Our focus extends beyond textiles to innovations in our brands like mycelium-based products at Balenciaga or Gucci ’s Demetra bio-based material. By encouraging suppliers to source sustainably, we aim to transform the entire supply chain. Inspired by the Material Innovation Lab’s success, we launched the Jewellery Lab in 2020 to support brands like Boucheron , Qeelin and Pomellato. Despite initial challenges, collaborative efforts between technical and design teams have driven our progress. How would you define a truly sustainable brand? First thing, produce what you sell. Secondly, ensure full traceability in raw materials because without it, sustainability criteria can’t be implemented. Maximising the use of recycled raw materials helps avoid reliance on new ones. Additionally, brands should encourage product usage, whether through repairs or resale. Each production should consider environmental and social aspects, ensuring fair wages in the supply chain. It’s easier for brands to embed sustainability from the beginning, starting with design. Beyond products, sustainable brands consider their shops, certification, transportation and advertising. A holistic approach is crucial, measuring the overall footprint, including boutiques and marketing strategies. A clear framework and systematic approach are essential. Brands must consider sustainability in every decision, just as they do with cost. Starting with sustainability from the beginning is crucial as retrofitting later can be difficult. What does impact mean to you? It is to have positive benefits for people and the planet.",

That could involve expanding its current centre in Milan or building an entirely new facility. Earlier, the company announced investing heavily in Spain and Germany. Public cloud [...]",
        "content": "Public cloud provider AWS is currently in talks with the Italian government about the size and location of the expansion, based on four anonymous sources. AWS and the Italian government keep their lips tightly sealed for now. The company built its first data centre in the country in 2020 as part of a two billion euro investment. Among its customers are Ferrari and the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali. Big investment in Spain as well AWS also recently announced an investment of 15.7 billion euros to , more precisely in the autonomous region of Aragon in the northeast of the country. The regional government there announced that that investment will be spread over a 10-year period. This cancels the company’s older plans for the region, which involved an investment of ‘only’ 2.5 billion euros. According to the government of Aragon, the new plans are “the largest technology investment in Spain and southern Europe ever.” The expansion should also lead to some 17,500 additional jobs, claims Amazon, not only at the company itself but also in the supply chain, maintenance, telecommunications, and construction. Some 40 percent of the jobs will end up in Aragon, which should boost the local economy. AWS already has a data center in the region, which Amazon says is running entirely on renewable energy. The plan is to keep it that way. The company even promises to give back water through reclamation and repair water pipes in the area in case of leaks, reducing water loss. European Sovereign Cloud Earlier, we wrote that AWS has big ambitions regarding its European Sovereign Cloud. Until 2040, the company is investing 7,8 billion euros to expand in Germany. Including learning and sustainability projects as well as third-party contributions, the total investment would total 17,2 billion euros, AWS said. Since 2010, parent company Amazon has invested 150 billion euros for both retail and the AWS cloud service and today employs 150,000 people within the Eurozone. AWS said it expected the financial injection to spur additional investments in the European cloud. That soon became apparent when the German subsidiary of Spain’s Telefónica transferring about 1 million 5G customers to AWS. That was the first time a major telecom company said it would move an existing customer base to a public cloud. AWS European Sovereign Cloud was in cooperation with the German government, in part to comply with . Unlike France, Germany partnered with an American player in doing so. This led to annoyance in Paris, as the French want to involve European players to shape ‘cloud sovereignty’. The French government does not want to partner with American players for sovereign services and has spoken out against that idea.",

Have you ever been in a predicament where your says “I like people who...” and it’s followed by something super niche?

Well if you’ve been there, done that, there’s a just for you. But I must warn you, some of these stories are so cringe-worthy, your butt cheeks will clench so hard that they will cease to exist. OK, maybe not that extreme, but close enough. The origins of the TikTok trend are not known however punters who partake in the humiliation ritual follow the same formula. Here’s a prime example of the trend: Most of these video begin with the creator starring down the barrel alongside some text that reads: “I remember when my crush said they liked girls/guys who...” During this, ‘s “Crazy” plays, specifically the lyric where they sing “I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.” Following that sombre lyric, the creator follows it up with the ~quirky, cringeworthy, wild~ thing they did in an attempt to woo their crush. Aussie TikToker ( ) clocked more than 17.3 million views on her video where she revealed she dressed up as after her crush said he had a thing for the “Side by Side” singer. “When the guy I had a crush on said he liked Ariana Grande so I posted this,” she wrote before sharing the hilarious footage. Another TikToker ( ) nabbed more than 25.7 million views after she lipsynced to ‘s “ ” after her crush said he liked exotic girls. The revelations, the cringe and the stories go on and on. The audio has been used in more than 80.1K TikToks. Peep below for some of the wild lengths people have gone to for their crushes! With this amount of videos, it truly feels like this situation is a . Love truly makes us do some questionable stuff. It can even turn us into vampires for a day, just like that one TikToker.

        "description": "Kempower will supply its megawatt charging solutions to Hedin Supercharge in Linköping, Sweden. Hedin Supercharge is currently opening a charging hub with hardware from Kempower at a new location in Linköping.",
        "content": "Hedin Supercharge is the charging infrastructure subsidiary of the Swedish car dealer Hedin Mobility Group, which was . The charging hub in Linköping will initially be equipped with four CCS charging points for fast charging of electric cars and lorries, providing up to 400 kW of power. Before the end of this year, the site will be one of the first in the world to use Kempower’s . Kempower relies on a decentralised principle for its direct current charging stations: the power supply units with the switching technology can be placed a few metres away from the actual charging station. The charging station itself – also known as a satellite charger – can therefore be very compact and narrow, which minimises the space required at the parking space itself. Typically, two 600 kW units can supply several HPC satellites for electric cars. In the case of the MCS unit, however, the 2×600 kW are bundled and used for one satellite. This has a liquid-cooled MCS charging plug and can therefore deliver a total output of 1.2 megawatts to the vehicle to be charged. Linköping is located in the Swedish province of Östergötlands Iän on one of the motorway links between Stockholm and Gothenburg. “Linköping offers a strategic location along the E4 highway, where significant transport and travel occur between the country’s major cities,” writes Kempower. Hedin Supercharge’s charging park is located in the car park of one of Hedin’s new multi-brand car dealerships and service centres. The charging park is accessible via the Virta platform – and can therefore also be used with common roaming services. The site is also home to a truck centre that sells and services heavy commercial vehicles. “With the inauguration in Linköping, we are beginning a new chapter and starting to work more closely with the transport sector. Together with our existing and upcoming charging stations for passenger cars, we are now well-equipped for expansion both within and outside Sweden’s borders,” said Erik Aspholmer, CEO of Hedin Supercharge. “We strongly believe that our offering of fast and easy charging will make it easier for all types of electrified transport in the future.” Erik Kanerva, Sales Manager for Northern Europe at Kempower, added: “The charging site is MCS-prepared and will be among the first in the world to offer MCS charging with our Kempower Mega Satellites. During the inauguration in Linköping, one can get acquainted with the future solution, a big sibling to our Kempower Satellite that is a familiar sight for many EV drivers in Sweden.” , (Hedin announcement, PDF)",

        "description": "Curacao welcomed more than 63,000 visitors in March this year. By the end of the fourth week of the month, the island set a new milestone for stayover tourist arrivals.",
        "content": "Curacao welcomed more than 63,000 visitors in March this year. By the end of the fourth week of the month, the island set a new milestone for stayover tourist arrivals. Curacao has seen the travel industry take off across the island over the past few years. According to the Curacao Tourist Board , from December of 2023 to March, the island saw more than 60,000 stay-over guests each month, and overall, a 38% increase in arrivals since last year. What’s behind the island’s boom in popularity? Curacao has always been popular among a diverse base of tourists. A vast majority, specifically 40%, of these travelers hail from Europe. Tourists from the United States and Canada are not far behind, contributing 38% of the market share. In March of this year, the island welcomed more than 18,000 visitors from the U.S, setting a record with a 58% increase since last year. South America accounts for 17% of visitors, and visitors from the Caribbean contribute 4%. Curacao , has a global appeal, welcoming more and more travelers from all corners of the planet every year. The island enjoys popularity among various age groups, especially among younger visitors and families. The largest portion, 36% of visitors, belong to the 25- to 44-year-old age group, closely followed by the 45- to 64-year-old age group, 35% of the total arrivals. In November last year, Expedia published a report on the travel dupes for 2024. Travel dupes are one of the latest TikTok trends. These vacation destinations are less crowded and often considerably cheaper — yet offer the same cultural or adventure-oriented features as the most popular travel spots. The Expedia article proposes some brilliant destination dupes. It offers Taipei as opposed to Seoul, Memphis as opposed to Nashville, Paros instead of Santorini, Quebec as a dupe for Geneva, Liverpool as London’s alternative, and so on. The rising popularity of destination dupes is also understandable. After all, many vacation hotspots are more expensive than others owing to their ever-booming popularity. The more tourists throng to these destinations, the higher the airfares, accommodation prices, and general cost of traveling, including food and visits to local attractions these locations surge. Also, the more popular the destination, the more overcrowded it is. Curacao is often a dupe of popular island destination Saint Martin. Throngs of visitors from all over the world each year flock to Saint Martin. The Caribbean island receives more than one million visitors through the international airport each year. Indeed, destination dupes may be the new travel trend that will continue to dominate this year. The Expedia report shows there has been a massive surge in the global search for these hotspot duplicates. While the global searches for Taipei rose 2,786%, Pattaya’s search popularity rose by 249%. Flight searches to these dupes have also been booming. People looking for flights to Curacao rose by 185%, while those looking for ones to Perth and Liverpool rose by 109% and 97%, respectively. As a destination duplicate of St. Martin, Curacao has much to offer. While St. Martin boasts a half-French and half-Dutch heritage, Curacao also has Dutch history. With shimmering gold beaches and turquoise waters just waiting to be explored, the Caribbean nation offers all the charms of St. Martin and then some. So, it is no wonder why the global searches for the island have increased by 228%. Curacao has about eight different all-inclusive resorts across the island for visitors to choose from on their vacation. From family-friendly resorts to intimate adults-only locations , these resorts offer beachfront access and relaxation with the convenience of a highly rated all-inclusive resort. While St. Martin may flaunt its French colonial past with its exquisite architectural spreads, Curacao’s Handelskade waterfront has its charms. The 18th-century buildings not only breathe history but are also visually enthralling, with the line of pastel-hued buildings just begging one to take a stroll through time. Scuba diving is a popular tourist activity in Curacao. Exploring the coral formations of the Mushroom Forest, located just off the island's coast, should be on everyone's bucket list. The food here is also worth experiencing. The cuisine is a medley of African, European, and Caribbean influences. The pastechi, deep-fried pastries, and the karni stoba stew are must-tries on any trip to Curacao.",

        "content": "Star Citizen has now raised over $700 million according to figures from developer Cloud Imperium Games. The developer behind the controversial space sim makes revenue publicly available on its website , which at the time of this article’s publication shows Star Citizen has raised $701,186,615. CIG calls this money “funds raised.” CIG even breaks down the revenue by recent months, weeks, and hours. At its lowest point on the morning of May 28, Star Citizen brought in $42,886 in one hour, about $1.5 million yesterday, May 27, $10,883,513 last week, and $4,753,264 for the month of April (things appear to have picked up considerably in May after the launch of the Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons update ). Star Citizen is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games. Over the 12 years since its crowdfunding drive began, it's been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism. Alpha 3.23 launched two months after CIG began talking about Star Citizen’s 1.0 launch being within sight , over a decade after the game released its first crowdfunding drive. CIG chief Chris Roberts has said 2024 will see the launch of Star Citizen Alpha 4.0, and that the developer is working to bring features developed for Squadron 42 , the standalone story-based game starring the likes of Mark Hamill and Gillian Anderson, to the persistent universe portion of the game “at an accelerated rate”. This is all building up to Star Citizen 1.0, which, Roberts has said, “is what we consider the features and content set to represent ‘commercial’ release.” However, there is still no release date or even release window for Star Citizen 1.0. CIG will share the roadmap later this year, it has said. Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

        "description": "Seven new-build primary schools are progressing to the procurement and construction phase after an additional £80m of education capital funding was announced.",
        "content": "Projects at Bangor Central Integrated Primary School, Crawfordsburn Primary School, Edendork Primary School, Glenwood Primary School, Mary Queen of Peace Primary School, Millennium Integrated Primary and Scoil an Droichid will progress to the next stage. Meanwhile, eight primary and post-primary schools will also receive investment through major extension and refurbishment and new-build construction projects – Abbey Community College, Carniny Primary School, Kilronan Special School, Lurgan Model Integrated Primary School, St John’s Primary School (Kingsisland), St Malachy’s College, St Mary’s Primary School (Barr) and St Kevin’s College. The funding announced by Education Minister Paul Givan will also see the launch of a new programme of curriculum-led investment. Earlier this year, it was announced that £150m of funding promised for new buildings in 2015's Fresh Start Agreement was no longer available, a move which jeopardised some new school projects. On a visit to Bangor Central Integrated Primary School, one of the schools which will now proceed to tender and construction, Mr Givan said he moved the school to his conventional major works programme, which allowed the £10m project to proceed. Mr Givan said: “Today’s significant announcement will see 15 schools benefiting from new state-of-the-art facilities for young people from Belfast to Ballymena to Enniskillen and beyond. The investment will also provide a welcome boost to the construction industry over the next number of years.” He added: “I also plan over coming weeks to launch a series of targeted smaller scale investment programmes to support and enhance the delivery of the curriculum in our schools. Potential schemes in this area will include specialist curriculum accommodation at post-primary; outdoor play and PE in the primary phase and curriculum resources and equipment more widely. “It is my priority to ensure the educational experiences of as many children and young people as possible across Northern Ireland are impacted positively by capital investment.” The opening capital budget for education in 2024-25 is £254 million. In part, this will allow continued investment in ten major school build projects currently in contract or on site and digital infrastructure across the schools’ estate, the Department of Education said.",

The tests are conducted using blood culture methods that allow detection of microorganisms in the blood. Market Dynamics: Rising prevalence of bloodstream infections and growing healthcare spending are expected to drive the market growth over the forecast period. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 270,000 cases of bloodstream infections occur annually in the United States. This increasing prevalence of bloodstream infections has increased the demand for effective diagnostic solutions. Furthermore, growing healthcare spending in developing countries is also expected to fuel the market growth during the forecast period. The advanced features of automated blood culture systems such as continuous monitoring, rapid detection, automated alerts and reporting functions have gained popularity over conventional blood culture systems. Advancements in blood culture techniques with improved antibiotic susceptibility reporting are also expected to support the market growth in coming years.

Growing Demand for Early Diagnosis and Rapid Detection of BSI Drives the Market The increasing demand for early diagnosis and rapid detection of bloodstream infections is a major driver for the bloodstream infection testing market. Traditional blood culturing techniques can take 24-72 hours to detect pathogens which leads to delay in appropriate antibiotic therapy. This delay in detection and treatment results in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Rapid diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens directly from blood within hours are addressing this need for early diagnosis. Their ability to provide results much faster than conventional blood cultures allows for prompt administration of targeted antibiotic therapy. This in turn leads to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. Rise in Antimicrobial Resistance Presents a Challenge The rising antimicrobial resistance among various pathogens has emerged as a key challenge for the bloodstream infection testing market. Widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics over the past decades has contributed significantly to the growth and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms. These resistant pathogens are difficult to treat effectively using conventional antibiotics. This significantly reduces treatment options and increases mortality rates. The limited development of new classes of antibiotics in recent years has further exacerbated the problem. Pathogens resistant to last resort antibiotics like carbapenems are increasingly being reported worldwide. This makes rapid and accurate detection of resistant strains more important than ever to optimize antibiotic therapy. Buy This Premium Report and Get Upto 25 % OFF: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/buy-now/1727 Opportunity for Development of Molecular Diagnostic Tests The increasing adoption of molecular diagnostic techniques like PCR and next generation sequencing provides new opportunities for bloodstream infection testing market players. Molecular tests can detect a broad range of pathogens directly from blood in fewer hours compared to blood cultures. They also enable early identification of antimicrobial resistance genes in infecting pathogens. This helps initiate targeted therapy sooner. Continuous technological advancements are making molecular assays easier to use at the point-of-care. The development and commercialization of rapid, affordable, and accurate molecular diagnostic tests for bloodstream infections can significantly improve patient outcomes. Growing Demand for Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs Drives Market Innovation The rising demand for antimicrobial stewardship programs in healthcare facilities worldwide is a major trend in the bloodstream infection testing market. These programs aim to optimize antibiotic use and reduce antimicrobial resistance. Rapid and accurate detection of bloodstream pathogens plays a pivotal role in enabling timely review of antibiotic regimens and de-escalation of therapy when appropriate. This contributes to better patient outcomes as well as reduced consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Leading marker players are continuously innovating and introducing novel diagnostic solutions that facilitate effective implementation of stewardship programs.

        "description": "Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya and his wife Natasa Stankovic are rumored to be getting divorced due to her absence from IPL 2024 and his poor performance. Natasa removing Pandya from her social media added fuel to the fire.",
        "content": "Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya and his Serbian actress-model wife Natasa Stankovic are much in the news lately with rumour of their divorce. What sparked the rumour was Natasa's visible absence from IPL 2024 and Hardik's poor performance on the field. The couple also haven't posted about each other or commented on each other's posts online for quite some time now. And when Natasa Stankovic recently removed Hardik's surname, Pandya, from her social media profile, it added more fuel to the fire. Amidst the rumour of their separation, there's another rumour doing rounds on the internet that Natasa will get 70 per cent of Hardik's properties if the couple divorces. The reason: It is speculated that the couple had signed a pre-nuptial agreement before getting married in July 2020. However, there isn't any substantial proof of this speculation. But what is a pre-nuptial agreement and is it legally valid in India? What are the pros and cons of it? Read on to know more. In India, a pre-nuptial agreement, just like any regular contract, comes under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. However, they are not recognised traditionally as personal laws for different religions govern over civil contracts when it comes to matters of marriage in the country. However, people who want to protect against losing their assets in case of a divorce in future can opt for pre-nuptial agreements before getting married. Explaining this, Dr. Rennie Joyy, Lawyer and Founder of Aalekh Foundation, told us, \"In India, marriages are governed by various personal laws based on religion, and they are not considered contracts in the conventional sense. The concept of a \" contract marriage \" as understood in some Western countries doesn't have a legal framework in India. However, the Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows for civil marriages irrespective of religion, where marriage can be seen as a contractual agreement to some extent, but it's still bound by the provisions of the Act rather than a standalone contract.\" Elaborating further, she added, \"Prenuptial agreements (prenups) are not explicitly recognized or enforceable under Indian law. Indian marriage laws , such as the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Special Marriage Act, 1954, do not have provisions that address prenuptial agreements directly. Courts in India have not traditionally upheld these agreements, viewing marriage primarily as a sacrament rather than a contract.\" To help one better understand pre-nuptial agreements and if they should sign one before getting married, Dr. Rennie Joyy also shared some pros and cons about it. The pros are: 1. Asset protection: It clearly defines asset ownership and division in divorce, safeguarding individual property and family inheritance. 2. Debt liability: Ensures pre-marriage debts remain the responsibility of the debtor spouse. 3. Conflict reduction: Minimizes disputes and litigation over property and finances during divorce. 4. Financial clarity: Provides financial transparency and planning for both parties. Meanwhile, the cons of pre-nuptial agreements in India are: 1. Enforcement issues: Lack of explicit legal recognition results in uncertain enforceability, subject to judicial interpretation. 2. Trust issues: It may be seen as distrustful, causing emotional strain in a marriage. 3. Changing circumstances: May not account for future changes, e.g., children or financial status. 4. Public policy: Courts may invalidate clauses contrary to public policy, such as predetermined child custody or maintenance waivers. In other news, both Hardik and Natasa haven't been spotted together for quite some time now. While Natasa was seen hanging out with a friend in Mumbai over the weekend, Hardik is said to be on a vacation abroad. It is noted that the couple got married during the COVID-19 lockdown in May 2020 and two months later, they welcomed their son Agastya in July 2020. In February 2023, they renewed their vows to each other in a grand wedding celebration in Udaipur, Rajasthan. While rumours are rife about their divorce, both Hardik and Natasa haven't given any statement about it. They have neither accepted nor denied the rumours.",

        "content": "AMBLER – Area gathered on Friday, May 24, to reaffirm a commitment to continue fostering bonds between area residents and law enforcement. The two factions originally came together to sign a memorandum of understanding that outlined a community outreach engagement plan back in April 2021. The agreement stipulates a series of action items including reducing biases, as well as increasing dialogues and interactions to better establish a rapport with community members, according to the memorandum of understanding. “It’s something that we have been consistently doing since that time period,” said NAACP Ambler Branch President Shaykh Anwar Muhammad. “We have been working together to do a variety of things — there’s been events, there’s been better hiring practices, there’s been things that have been implemented to make our community safer.” The memorandum of understanding spotlighted agencies within the geographic boundaries of the NAACP Ambler branch, which encompasses the North Penn, Upper Dublin and Wissahickon school districts. Participating agencies include police departments in Ambler, Hatfield, Lansdale, and North Wales, as well as Lower Gwynedd, Montgomery, Towamencin, Upper Dublin, Upper Gwynedd, and Whitpain townships. “I want people to know that what we set out to do as an organization and as the police departments in our jurisdiction — that the promises we made, and the commitments that we’ve made – that we’ve continued, and it’s something that we take very seriously, and that’s something that we want to achieve together. So we still work at it all the time,” Muhammad said in a phone interview with MediaNews Group. Participating police chiefs stressed that the continued partnership is crucial. Recalling signing the memorandum the first time, Upper Dublin Township Police Chief Francis Wheatley underscored that “it’s a living document” that requires an “ongoing commitment.” “It shows that not just an individual township, that multiple townships, that every organization, police department within this chapter is 100 percent behind the commitment to transparency and accessibility and we work together to resolve problems,” Wheatley said. Lansdale Police Chief Michael B. Trail agreed. “I think just representing all the police departments are here today, and the community it’s really important to us. We realize our mission is to support the community and keep it safe and through that we need their support, and transparency is really important,” Trail said. “Accountability is really important. When our officers go out and do the right thing, we want to reward them,” he continued. “When things go wrong, we want to figure out what went wrong, how they (should) be held accountable. Partnerships with the NAACP in this county have been great, and they’ve been very rewarding I think for the police departments and the community ...” Friday’s meeting took place ahead of the anniversary of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25, 2020. The tragedy , including in Philadelphia, as well as locally in Montgomery County where many demonstrators called for police reforms. “I think you know post-George Floyd, I think it’s really important that from a law enforcement standpoint that these relationships can’t be after an incident, they have to be before, and so I appreciate the leadership of the Ambler chapter, and they keep us on their radar, and not just for the signing ceremony, but we get together regularly,” Wheatley said. Community policing strategies and outreach campaigns remain crucial for improving relations. Many police chiefs also serve as members of the NAACP’s Ambler branch, which Muhammad stressed “that’s a great show of faith, and ... commitment.” “I will always think that there’s still work to be done community wise, but I do feel there have been strides made, most definitely,” Muhammad said. Muhammad added that he’s observed “organic” interactions within the community that have been “very productive and positive.” It’s a foundation they’ve built and continue to work at each day, which is something both the police chiefs and Muhammad wanted the community to know. “That both sides are still working and both sides are committed to working. Both sides are committed to a better community,” he said. “Like I said, more positive policing community policing, both sides are diligently working to make sure that that’s something that we get to experience here or we do experience here.”",

        "content": "Wrexham.com has invited the four North Wales Members of the Senedd to write a monthly column with updates on their work. You can find their updates – along with contributions from the Wrexham and Clwyd South MPs and MSs – here . In this month’s column for Wrexham.com, Welsh Labour MS Carolyn Thomas writes: A rain-drenched Rishi Sunak announcing a UK General Election to the tune of ‘Things Can Only Get Better’ being blared out of a speaker by a protestor summed up the mood of the country after nearly a decade and a half of Conservative governments. The last fourteen years have been characterised by a programme of grinding austerity and vicious cuts to public services. The few services that have survived are too often teetering on the brink of collapse because of deliberate underfunding. There is little doubt that the UK is a far poorer country as a direct result of austerity policies. Even many of the economists, who after the 2008 financial crisis, suggested austerity was the only option, now accept that this was an incorrect diagnosis which brought with it deadly consequences. The results of those policies are impossible to escape – the worst fall in living standards since records began, real terms wage cuts for workers, the NHS struggling, a demoralised public sector workforce, a housing market which is out of control, food prices and mortgages through the roof, local authorities declaring bankruptcy, and more food banks than branches of McDonalds. By contrast, and despite significant funding restraints caused by Westminster cuts, Wales has continued to lead the way in showing that progressive politics and collaboration achieves tangible results. We’ve seen a groundbreaking trial of Universal Basic Income, the extension of universal free school meals for primary school children, active intervention in the housing crisis by tackling the growth in second homes, and the Real Living Wage for social care workers. Across the country, the National Health Service, local government, housing, social care, and public transport are desperate for an end to real-terms cuts in funding. These are the building blocks of Britain. Investment in those building blocks leads to a healthier, happier, better educated, and better connected society – all of which is the basis for economic stability. The general election on July the 4th provides an opportunity to change course, to reject the politics of austerity and cuts, and to start building a country that is fit for both the present, and for the challenges of the future.

        "content": "Search engine behemoth, Google is set to take some market share from tech giant MIcrosoft with its latest move to acquire marketing software company Hubspot. According to reports, Google ‘s parent compnay Alphabet’s acquisition of the $30 billion-rated company is a component of its ambition to take on Microsoft in the market for cloud applications. In a research note seen by Reuters, Cowen analyst Derrick Wood stated, “It does appear that Google has aspirations to try to take market share from Microsoft in the productivity suite, and they can use HubSpot to bundle applications together for clients.” READ ALSO: Google risks EU sanctions for failing to respond to legally binding request Alphabet and HupSpot are continuing their talks, according to sources familiar with the situation cited by Bloomberg, although no deal has been finalized as of yet. Reuters reported last month that Alphabet was having talks about a takeover with investment bankers from Morgan Stanley (MS). It was mentioned that this would be Alphabet’s largest acquisition to date if the deal went through. The news was released concurrently with HubSpot’s first-quarter diluted earnings per share of 12 cents. Analysts had been expecting a defeat. Better than anticipated, revenue rose by 23.1% on an annual basis to $617.4 million. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "The United National Party (UNP) has proposed to postpone Sri Lanka’s two upcoming elections by at least two years. UNP general secretary Palitha Range Bandara made this observation while attending a press conference in Colombo today (28). “Now we have to save the country from this bankruptcy and rebuild the country’s economy,” the former parliamentarian said. He stated that Sri Lanka has an agreement in place with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and if the said agreement is violated the country will regress back to how it was two years back. “So, do we want to knowingly go back to that point and get ruined? Or else do we reach a common agreement and postpone both these elections for two years?” “The President is not greedy to stay on. We are the ones asking,” he said, adding that funds should not be wasted by going for a general election at this time. “Postpone them both for two years. These issues can be resolved within those two years and afterwards elections can be held,” Range Bandara added.",

According to the USGBC (U.S. Green Building Council) report, green buildings can reduce carbon emissions by 34% and consume 25% less energy than conventional buildings. For instance, in 2021, according to the annual ranking report from the US Green Building Council (USGBC), China is ranked first with 1,077 certified LEED projects that reduced carbon emissions, followed by Canada with 205 LEED projects and India with 146 LEED projects. It has now become essential for commercial construction companies to give priority to sustainable design and construction techniques to utilise our planet's finite resources in a sensible way. Encouraging sustainable business practises is an important reason for building green in most countries, for the conservation of energy and protection of natural resources. Moreover, increased concerns about global warming resulted in sustainable and eco-friendly activities, which increased the demand for the growth of nonresidential green buildings market. Customise This Report As Per Your Requirements - https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/Customise?id=3979&type=smp Prominent Trend - Implementation Of Living Roofs Or Green Roofs Living roofs, or green roofs, are increasingly being implemented in green buildings. A green roof is a roof of a building that is covered with vegetation and soil, or a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. Green roofs last longer when compared to conventional roofs. They also reduce energy costs with natural insulation, reduce temperatures (heat and cold) by absorbing and trapping them, reduce storm water runoff, filter pollutants and carbon dioxide out of the air, and increase wildlife habitat in built-up areas. It is believed that to reduce the ambient temperature of the city by 2%, 8% of the roofs in the city must be greener. In the USA, around 25 cities have some sort of programme to encourage green roofs, and in Portland, Ore., it is mandatory to have vegetation cover 100% of the roofs on buildings in the central city over 20,000 square feet (with some exceptions). Therefore, green roofs are an emerging trend in the nonresidential green buildings market.

Victory for Express campaign as Devon village finally connected to broadband [INSIGHT] The village of Northleigh in Devon was recently hooked up to superfast broadband (Image: JONATHAN BUCKMASTER) It comes after the Daily Express launched a Get Britain Connected crusade to assist forgotten or ignored communities. The work is part of Openreach’s £15billion project to upgrade the broadband infrastructure. It wants to make gigabit tech available to 25 million homes and businesses by the end of 2026, including 6.2 million in rural areas. Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said: “We’re on track and on-budget to make this life-changing broadband technology available to 25 million homes and businesses. “We plan to build right across the UK, from cities and towns to far-flung farms and island communities. “Ultimately, we’ll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there’s a supportive political and regulatory environment. “Over time, we’ve learnt to deliver predictably, consistently and at a rapid pace – despite this being a hugely complex national engineering project. “That gives us confidence to be even clearer about our build plans and we want to be as transparent as possible about where and when we’re building. “Today we’re publishing more detail than ever about the places we’re building in now, and the communities we’ll be upgrading next.” READ MORE: ' We were quoted £115,000 for broadband — our nine-year battle to get connected' [EXCLUSIVE] Trending Kieran Wines, Openreach’s director for the East of England, added: “This is a huge infrastructure success story across the region. No company is building faster or further in Europe, that we’re aware of. “We won’t be stopping either. We plan to build even further across the region, to more cities and towns, and our most rural communities. “And our engineers, of which 3,000 live in the region, are doing this at a rapid pace – despite this being a hugely complex engineering project.” He urged people to use Openreach’s online fibre checker to find about local work.

Data from EarthCARE – which stands for Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer – could help in mitigating the threats posed by global warming, experts say. It is the brainchild of Professor Anthony Illingworth, from the University of Reading, who first conceived the idea more than 30 years ago. The project was adopted by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2004, and later became a joint mission with the Japanese space agency, Jaxa. It is scheduled for launch no earlier than May 28 on a Falcon 9 rocket. Prof Illingworth, who is professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Reading, said it is a “humbling and thrilling experience to be part of something so significant”. He said the EarthCARE data will help policymakers “make more informed decisions about how to mitigate and adapt to the challenges posed by a warming world”. Clouds play a vital role in controlling the temperature of the planet by reflecting sunlight back out to space and trapping heat. But little is known about how it drives the Earth’s climate system. The three-year mission, which cost more than 800 million euros (£680 million), is expected to provide answers. The UK Space Agency (UKSA) contributed around 120 million euros (£102 million) in funding towards the mission, over a period of 20 years. The satellite weighs just over two tonnes (2,200kg) and measures a little over 17m (56ft) in length.

        "description": "Written by Charlie McCloskey, Director of Events and Customer Experience at BWUH Ltd The 2017 Terrorist Attack at the Manchester Arena changed the lives of individuals, families, and communities forever, not least the live events community. As an event professional what has stuck with me since is that the concert goers had simply expected to [...]",
        "content": "The Manchester Arena event became a needed catalyst for change in public safety. It has brought about the intended introduction of Terrorism (Protection of Premises) Bill during the current parliamentary session. Poignantly, it’s also known as Martyn’s Law, in memory of Martyn Hett, one of 22 Manchester Arena victims. The law addresses that the threat picture in the public realm is real, complex, evolving, and enduring. It aims to raise security standards throughout the UK and will require all venues, regardless of capacity, to have necessary but proportionate procedures in place for managing threats to public safety. It’s a collective, coordinated approach that infinitely enhances venue knowledge and preparedness to raise the safety bar permanently. The Protect UK Conference was recently hosted at ICC Belfast, bringing together security experts, policymakers, and members of the events industry, to discuss the proposed legislation. Presented by TINYg, the world’s largest, free to use Counter Terrorism Information network, and the Department for Business and Trade, we were incredibly proud to host the event as it was an opportunity to show that our organisation stands united in advancing Martyn’s Law. Alongside others, we pledged to do our utmost to ensure no more lives are lost due to security vulnerabilities. As the operator of Northern Ireland’s only purpose-built conference centre, and two of the city’s best attended entertainment venues, Waterfront Hall and Ulster Hall, we wholly understand the importance of safety. Whilst our venues may be very different in terms of heritage, design, and event offering, the prioritisation of safety, security and emergency preparedness is evident across all three. And whilst extensive and proactive groundwork is already underway to assess our venues in detail, we have already made additional enhancements in the last six years, signalling just how profound an impact the 22 May 2017 had on the industry. We were shortlisted in Safety and Health Excellence (SHE) Awards 2024 for our project, ‘Operation Fallout’, which included a mock strategic emergency exercise to test the joint response to a range of incidents and emergency scenarios at Ulster Hall. This simulation modelled real-life scenarios and enhanced our teams’ readiness to manage emergency response procedures, improve the building’s infrastructure and our operational systems. In recent years, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver safe and secure events such as CYBER UK, Northern Ireland Investment Summit as well as Festival of Remembrance, amongst our entertainment schedule, all further testified by ICC Belfast becoming the only conference venue in the UK and Ireland to be awarded ‘gold’ at the Eventex Awards 2024. At its core, Martyn’s Law is about keeping people safe in their communities by bringing greater alignment amongst the operators of public venues and their safety partners including local authorities and emergency services. However, its introduction requires ongoing support and commitment from businesses. I urge our venues here in Northern Ireland to view it as a positive step forward, and a change that empowers us to protect our patrons, staff and delivery partners, so that people can safely enjoy our towns, cities and communities, today, tomorrow and beyond.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress leader Derek O'Brien on Tuesday said the outgoing Lok Sabha has many \"dubious firsts\", and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of turning Parliament into a \"deep, dark chamber\". In a post on X, the Parliamentary Party Leader of the TMC in Rajya Sabha also said that this was the first time that no deputy speaker was appointed, and the prime minister did not answer a single question. \"Mr Narendra Modi, since you are in my city today, care to tell us all why you have mocked Parliament and turned it into a deep dark chamber,\" he said. \"Goodbye to the 17th Lok Sabha. This was a Lok Sabha of many dubious firsts,\" he said. \"In terms of number of sittings, this was the least productive Lok Sabha (lowest days worked) since 1952. No Deputy Speaker was appointed for its entirety,\" he said. The 17th Lok Sabha had the lowest number of sittings among the Lok Sabhas that had a full term of five years. According to data compiled by think-tank PRS Legislative Research, the 17th Lok Sabha had 272 sittings altogether over its five year tenure from 2019-2024. The 16th Lok Sabha had 331 sittings, while the 15th and 14th Lok Sabha under the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government had 332 and 356 sittings respectively. The 13th Lok Sabha had 356 sittings. \"The prime minister did not answer a single question on the floor of the House...Not a single notice by a member of the opposition was accepted for discussion (Rule 267) in Rajya Sabha,\" he stated. \"An MP from the treasury was permitted to use communal slurs on the floor of the House...\" he said in an apparent reference to BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri who was accused of using a communal slur in the Lok Sabha. Referring to the security breach in Parliament, he said, \"First-ever Security Breach Inside Lok Sabha... 146 MPs from the opposition were suspended for demanding a discussion about the breach\". In a major security breach on December 13, 2023, two persons -- Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D -- jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs. Around the same time, two other accused -- Amol Shinde and Neelam Devi -- also sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting \"tanashahi nahi chalegi\" outside Parliament premises. Following the breach, 100 MPs were suspended in the Lok Sabha, and 46 MPs were suspended in Rajya Sabha for protesting and disrupting the proceedings as they demanded a discussion on the breach. \"About 300 questions by opposition MPs were deleted,\" he added. As the MPs were suspended, about 264 questions raised by the suspended Opposition MPs were deleted from the list of queries in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha during the session. According to a report of the PRS, since December 14, when the first batch of MPs were suspended, till the end of the Winter Session, 12 percent of the questions were cancelled in Lok Sabha and 13 percent in Rajya Sabha. As part of the campaigning in the last phase of Lok Sabha polls, Modi will hold a mega roadshow in Kolkata on Tuesday. Two seats of Kolkata Uttar and Kolkata Dakshin will be voting in the seventh phase on June 1.",

        "description": "Justice Sanjeev Kumar heard multiple petitions from local contractors who were denied permission to participate in government tenders due to alleged familial ties to militants or separatistsThe post Contractors having separatist relatives can’t be barred from govt tenders: J&K High Court appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "The Jammu & Kashmir High Court has ruled in favor of contractors previously delisted for being relatives of militants and separatists, allowing them to participate in the tendering process, The Hindu reported on Tuesday. The court quashed an order from the Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, issued on March 15, 2023. Justice Sanjeev Kumar heard multiple petitions from local contractors who were denied permission to participate in government tenders due to alleged familial ties to militants or separatists. The judge found merit in these petitions and quashed the communication from the department. He directed that the petitioners be permitted to participate in the tendering process. The court noted that the competent authority had not proposed to cancel or refuse to renew the contractors’ registration certificates. The decision to debar them was based solely on the involvement of one or more relatives in anti-national activities in the early 1990s or later. The newspaper quoted Justice Kumar as saying that this was not a valid ground to deprive the petitioners of their right to enter contracts with the government for public works. The Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj had barred several local contractors from the tendering process based on a report from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The CID report indicated that close relatives of the petitioners had been involved in subversive activities. Some of these relatives had been dead for decades. Justice Kumar ruled that the communication violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and their right to livelihood under Article 21. He emphasized that in a democracy governed by the rule of law, no authority could subvert constitutional provisions. Referring to the 2010 rehabilitation policy for former militants who crossed into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Justice Kumar stated that the court could not remain a mute spectator to such violations of citizens’ fundamental rights. The policy aimed to facilitate the return of former militants who had given up insurgent activities and sought to reintegrate into mainstream society. Justice Kumar questioned the rationale behind the communication issued by the then commissioner/secretary, noting that the contractors were barred on the basis of tenuous connections to relatives involved in anti-national activities many years ago. He pointed out that many of these relatives had either died or surrendered to become law-abiding citizens. The court deemed the matter serious and ordered a copy of the judgment to be placed before the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for departmental action against the concerned commissioner/secretary. The Chief Secretary is to submit a report on the action taken within two months. The case is listed for July 29, 2024. Official figures indicate that over 212 people returned from PoK through Nepal and other routes between 2010 and 2012 under the 2010 rehabilitation policy.",

        "description": "APEC Climate Centre predicts the weather event during Sept-Nov 2024",
        "content": "By Subramani Ra Mancombu Comments READ LATER Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has said the “La Nina” watch declared by it a couple of weeks ago does not guarantee that the weather event that results in widespread rains in Asia, particularly India, will develop. In its climate driver update on Tuesday, the Australian weather agency said four of seven models suggest sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are likely to remain at neutral ENSO levels, with the remaining three models showing SSTs cooling to La Niña levels from August. “The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is currently neutral. However, the Bureau’s ENSO Outlook is at La Niña Watch, due to some early signs that an event might form in the Pacific Ocean later in 2024,” it said. But the “La Niña Watch does not guarantee that a La Niña will develop”. “There is about an equal chance of neutral ENSO conditions in the same outlook period,” BoM said. However, in its outlook for June-November 2023, the APEC Climate Centre issued a “La Niña Watch”. It said the index is expected to be -0.1°C in June 2024 and gradually decrease to -1.1°C in November 2024. “The probability for ENSO neutral conditions is expected to be 52 per cent for June – August 2024 and then decrease. Meanwhile, the chance for La Niña conditions is expected to gradually increase and then become dominant (~57%) for September – November 2024,” it said. The APEC Climate Centre has predicted - in line with the India Meteorological Department forecast - an enhanced probability for above-normal precipitation for the western Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, India, the Bay of Bengal and Indonesia. Meanwhile, the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), an arm of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in its weekly update that El Nino, which emerged in June 2023, is transitioning toward ENSO-neutral. “A transition from El Niño to ENSO-neutral is likely next month. La Niña may develop in June-August 2024 (49% chance) or July-September (69% chance),” CPC said. The CPC view contrasts the Bureau of Meteorology, which said in April that drought-bearing El Nino had ended. The US weather agency said since mid-March 2024, below-average SSTs had emerged in the eastern Pacific and expanded slightly westward. BoM said SSTs in the central Pacific have been steadily cooling since December 2023. This surface cooling is supported by a significant amount of sub-surface cooling in the central and eastern Pacific. Recent cloud and surface pressure patterns are ENSO-neutral, it said. “Climate models suggest that SSTs in the central tropical Pacific will likely continue to cool over the coming months,” the weather agency said. The Australian weather agency said the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or “Indian Nino” is currently neutral. The most recent 4 weeks have seen the IOD index within neutral thresholds, with the latest week just below the positive IOD threshold (+0.40 °C). Global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have been the warmest on record for each month between April 2023 and April 2024, with May 2024 SSTs on track to exceed May 2023. “The global pattern of warmth is affecting the typical historical global pattern of sea surface temperatures associated with ENSO and IOD. As the current global ocean conditions have not been observed before, historical comparisons based on past ENSO or IOD events may not be reliable,” it said. Comments",

        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif Tuesday invited Chinese firms, especially from the textile sector, to establish plants in Pakistan stressing that the government will provide all possible facilities to Chinese industrialists and investors. \"China is an important partner in Pakistan's economic development,\" PM Shehbaz said while chairing a high-level review meeting regarding increasing cooperation between the two nations in various fields. Terming Beijing as a key partner of Islamabad in economic development, the premier expressed intention to boost bilateral cooperation in agriculture, information technology (IT) and energy sectors and increase exports of Pakistani products to China. Speaking at the huddle, also attended by Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and other senior officials, the prime minister said that the government is ardently preparing for the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \"Gwadar port will be made a logistics hub with Chinese cooperation [...] the establishment of Agriculture Demonstration Zones will be an important project in the next phase of CPEC,\" he said. Underscoring that China can help Pakistan in setting up a strategy for increasing its exports, the PM also directed relevant ministries to prepare new projects aimed at enhancing Pakistan-China cooperation as well as undertake measures to promote business to business ties. The review meeting comes as PM Shehbaz is set to undertake his maiden visit to China in the second week of June in response to President Xi Jinping's invitation. Foolproof security for Chinese nationals On the issue of safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said that foolproof security will be provided to Chinese nationals and that a comprehensive security plan has already been chalked up in this regard. The prime minister's remarks come after Beijing, on Monday, reaffirmed its commitment to continue working with Pakistani authorities to strengthen security cooperation and ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel. Speaking at a press conference Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that Beijing will continue supporting Islamabad in the investigation of the Dasu attack to hunt down and punish the perpetrators of the terrorist attack. The spokesperson's comment came after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held a joint press conference with National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Necta) officials on the issue of Dasu suicide attack which saw at least six people, including five Chinese nationals, being killed after a suicide bomber rammed into their vehicle in Bisham. During the presser, the minister called on Afghanistan to hand over the militants involved in the deadly attack. \"[Pakistan has formally] requested the interim government in Afghanistan to arrest the leadership of [banned] TTP,\" he said. Meanwhile, Necta head Tahir Rai revealed that said that the explosive-laden vehicle that had hit the bus carrying the Chinese nationals reached Pakistan via Afghanistan. The official revealed that 11 suspects have been arrested in this case so far. Owing to the fatal attack, the federal cabinet has approved the Economic Coordination Committee's (ECC) decision regarding the disbursement of $2.58 million as part of the compensation package for the families of the Chinese nationals killed in the Dasu attack.",

Corstorphine Fair chairman Forbes Howie wants to see as many people as possible at the fair having fun and hopefully enjoying some sunshine. He said: “I hope everyone has great fun on a cracking day out. And hopefully the sun shines and all the local community groups make lots of money. “The whole event gives me great satisfaction. At this moment I’m really stressed, but when I see hordes of people having a great time on Saturday, that’s why I go through two weeks of hell!” Advertisement Advertisement Edinburgh’s largest community-run event will, like any other outdoor ‘summer’ event in Scotland, be dependent on the weather . The latest forecast for Saturday in Corstorphine by the Met Office predicts sunny intervals in the morning with the temperature at 14C and light winds of 6mph and gusts of 14mph. Cloud is expected in the afternoon when the temperature will climb to 17C at 4pm. Sunny intervals are then due to return at 7pm. The only possibility of rain forecast is a 10 per cent chance between 1pm and 4pm. Forbes explained how the fair is paid for by kind donations. He said: “Although entry is free to the park, we to try to put the onus on people donating a pound or two at the gates. And we give out free programmes. “They don’t need to donate but we have signs up saying please donate, as that will pay for the 2026 fair. Advertisement Advertisement “It costs about £20,000 to hold the event, when we have paid for the marquee, toilets, market traders licence and other licences. It all adds up. “We are a non-profit organisation. We give away any money we make to local groups and charities.” Corstorphine Fair started in its current guise in 1986, organised by the local community council. With this year’s event the 19th modern Corstorphine Fair. Previous community fairs have been held in the area, including the Corstorphine Round Table Fair in the 1950s and 60s, with singer Andy Stewart a star guest in 1960. In 1662 James Lord Forrester asked the Scottish Parliament to allow him to hold fairs in the village and was permitted to have a fair four times a year. He would probably have used the land we now know as St Margaret’s Park for part of his fairs.",

        "content": "Forget fancy dinners or grand romantic gestures. Local actor-presenter-DJ Mark Lee believes the greatest gift he can give his homemaker wife of more than two decades is financial security. The 55-year-old and Ms Catherine Ng, 51, celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary on May 27. The couple have three children – Calista, 15, Maksonn, 12, and Calynn, 10. “It is an ability if a husband makes money for his wife to spend,” Lee, who has his own production house King Kong Media Production, said in an interview with Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao. “It gives the family a sense of security so that the wife can run the household with peace of mind.” Lee and Ms Ng manage their own finances, but she controls the purse strings and he has no issue allowing her to buy whatever she wants. “She can spend my money, but she didn’t even buy a brand-name bag after having children, as she has spent all the money on them,” he said. Barbie Hsu’s ex-husband Wang Xiaofei weds again The couple booked a karaoke venue on May 25 to celebrate the special occasion, with about 30 friends and relatives in attendance, including actress Xiang Yun, actor Nick Teo and host-actress Ke Le. A post shared by 向云Xiang Yun's Official Account (@xiang_yun_) Lee, who starred in the comedy film Money No Enough 3 (2024), added: “To be honest, what a woman wants is a sense of security if she loves her husband. This sense of security is not just about not philandering, but also about finances, so that she doesn’t have to worry about things like daily necessities and growing old.” Being in the entertainment industry, which has its fair share of temptations, Lee said he reassures Ms Ng by being frank with her. “I may have a fun and playful personality, but I tease the girls only in front of my wife, and she also knows that I have no ulterior motive in treating them nicely,” he said. Lee added he is not interested in cheating. “I’m tired enough and don’t want to have any trouble in this area,” he said. “One has to lie if he goes astray, but men have bad memories and are exposed easily.” He said couples can sometimes understand each other and themselves through quarrels. “Sometimes, we think we are right, but we will find that it’s not necessarily true after quarrelling,” he said. “There will definitely be arguments, but I hope we can learn to understand each other’s feelings and thoughts, and then discuss them together. It’s a never-ending learning process as there will be new challenges in every phase of a marriage.” A post shared by Catherine Ng Ai Ling (@catng1313)",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Closing arguments in Donald Trump ‘s historic hush money trial are set to begin Tuesday morning, giving prosecutors and defense attorneys one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin. Jurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. At are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump’s then-lawyer, were falsely logged as “legal expenses” to hide the true nature of the transactions. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He pleaded not guilty to , charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. Closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday. The case is the first of Trump’s four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It’s unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election. Currently: — Here’s at Donald Trump’s hush money trial — As Trump’s hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators to get inside — Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? — Trump hush money case: A timeline of — Key players: Who’s who at Trump’s — Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to Here’s the latest: WHAT MUST BE PROVED FOR A CONVICTION? With closing arguments in Donald Trump’s hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them — deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he’s charged with. To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with . Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven’t proved Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. New York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump’s case and will not be considered by jurors. A SEAT IN COURT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS PROVES ALLURING FOR SOME For many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life. For others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump’s hush money trial ahead of Tuesday’s closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw — including professional line sitters with pup tents — for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal. Though most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump’s entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public. The former president’s Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners. WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK Closing arguments in Donald Trump’s hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony. Following the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president’s guilt or innocence. Jurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.",

        "content": "Yesterday, we honored those who gave the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe. My family is so fortunate that my dad and brother returned home safely. We still have family holidays and birthday celebrations, but for too many families that’s not the case. As the chair of the Assembly Military and Veteran Affairs Committee, it is also my responsibility to guard the interests of veterans in California, those who returned to us, though not necessarily in full health, so I want to take some time to report on the work we are doing in the Legislature to support California veterans. Having fought for our country, veterans deserve legislative champions who will fight for them, listen to them, and take their needs and priorities as seriously as they have taken their duty to their country. It has been a priority for me to take on taxation of military pensions and reform of the veterans’ property tax exemption. California is the last state in the union to provide no relief on the taxation of military retirees’ pensions. We have pushed this issue further forward than it has ever gone before, and will return next year with a renewed effort. The California Constitution provides property tax exemptions to homeowners, generally, but also to veteran homeowners, but the veterans’ exemption is hopelessly out-of-date, and even then is less than the exemption available to all homeowners. I have been working with my Senate counterpart, Sen. Bob Archuleta, D-Pico Rivera, to amend the state Constitution to make the veterans’ property tax exemption worthwhile. It will require voters’ approval, but I am confident it would pass. The bond act approved by voters in March included about $1 billion to build housing for veterans and their families at risk of homelessness. Since 2014, we’ve built thousands of units for veterans at risk of homelessness, and while homelessness overall has been on the rise, we have reduced homelessness among veterans by a substantial amount, and this allows us to build on that success. We are also implementing the California Veterans Health Initiative, a grant-funded pilot program to increase access to mental health services for veterans and their families. Last week was also the deadline for bills to move from the Assembly to the Senate, and there are three bills that are on their way to the Senate in support of our veterans and military personnel: Increasing Transparency at CalVet (Assembly Bill 1908) This bill will improve government transparency and performance by requiring the California Department of Veterans Affairs to report to the Legislature annually with a summary of the major findings of its internal audits, restoring a requirement that existed before the department’s inspector general was eliminated in 2004. Reservist Financial Support (AB 1854) This legislation gives more time for reservists to apply for deferment of payment and interest on certain debts, such as credit cards, vehicle loans, mortgages and more. These are protections already extended to reservists under state law, but members of the Guard and Reserve are often called to active duty on very short notice, and sometimes don’t learn of the protections the law provides until it is too late to take advantage of them. Deputy Secretary of Minority and Underrepresented Veteran Affairs (AB 1994) This bill would make permanent the recently created position of deputy secretary of minority and underrepresented veterans affairs, to ensure that those veterans who are already battling uphill for adequate representation have an advocate at the highest levels within CalVet. In our first year in the Assembly, we also brought a dedicated veteran services officer to Santa Clarita, something veterans in our community have been asking to have for years. After touring the SCV Veterans Center in 2022, I met with Jeff Stabile, a local veteran leader, about what veterans in our community needed. That’s when he told me about the need for a VSO locally, which is why we immediately got to work and delivered this important resource within just one week. A VSO is necessary for veterans to process paperwork in order to receive VA benefits, among other services they provide, and Santa Clarita had been without a dedicated one for a long time. Now, veterans in the area don’t have to travel outside of the area for this necessity. As we honor those who lost their lives in service of our country, let’s also stay committed to fighting for the resources our veterans and military families need to thrive. Pilar Schiavo, D-Chatsworth, represents the 40th Assembly District, which includes most of the Santa Clarita Valley in addition to the northwest San Fernando Valley. “Democratic Voices” appears Tuesdays and rotates among local Democrats.",

        "content": "Dare To Love Me Episode 5 Recap & Spoilers: Is Lee Yoo-Young Jealous of the New Woman in Kim Myung-Soo’s Life? By aired on May 27, 2024, on KBS 2TV. The unique rom-com drama stars and . While Myung-Soo plays Shin Yoon-Bok, portrays Kim Hong-Do. Yoon-Bok is a 21st-century MZ but believes in Confucian values because of his upbringing. On the other hand, Hong-Do is a modern woman who continuously struggles at work. The storyline revolves around these two characters with contrasting personalities and how love blooms between them. So far, their friendship has brought them closer than before. Hong-Do has also started to feel something for Yoon-Bok, but is it love? Meanwhile, a woman visits Yoon-Bok, and it seems Hong-Do is jealous of her. Who is the mysterious woman? Dare to Love Me episode 5: A mysterious woman visits Kim Myung-Soo Dare to Love Me episode 5 begins with an introduction of a mysterious woman who addresses Yoon-Bok informally. She says she wants to live with him; this proposal somewhat makes Shin Yoon-Bok ( ) and Kim Hong-Do uncomfortable. However, Yoon-Bok takes the woman inside his house and starts to behave rudely. He says he would like to see her gone until he returns. In the meantime, Hong-Do starts to wonder if she is Yoon-Bok’s ex-girlfriend who has returned to rekindle their relationship. She becomes too desperate to know the truth behind their bond. Later that night, she takes a plate full of fried chicken to Yoon-Bok’s house. Meanwhile, upon Yoon-Bok’s return, he sees that the woman has prepared a meal for him. In a flashback, it is shown that the woman was once a teenage girl who left a young Yoon-Bok along with their mother. This means she is his elder sister, Shin Yi-Bok. However, Hong-Do doesn’t know that. When she comes with the platter, she imagines all the stuff she shouldn’t have and hurts her own feelings. Meanwhile, Camille goes to Seonsang village to meet her old flame after 46 years. When Hong-Do comes up with Camille’s proposal to open the village for her show, he politely rejects it. Now, she visits the village looking absolutely gorgeous herself and demands it, but again gets rejected. She further hatches a plan that will unfold in the next episode. On the other hand, Hong-Do and Yi-Bok bond over beer after knowing who Yi-Bok ( ) is. However, it seems she is hiding her real identity when she says she is unemployed. In one of the scenes, she talks to one of the detectives and says that no one knows that she is an undercover cop, not even Yoon-Bok. While returning from work, Yoon-Bok sees an ice cream shop and reminisces about the time he spent with Hong-Do. He buys ice cream and reaches Hong-Do’s house. As he is about to knock on the door, she opens it, and they collide, falling on each other. Hong-Do’s heart flutters, proving it is love after all, at least from his side.

        "content": "Jennifer Lopez was scared after her face was stolen for artificial intelligence scams. The 54-year-old actress – who plays the title role in new Netflix sci-fi film ‘Atlas’, which explores the issues with AI – admitted she has struggled with the way technology has advanced, particularly when it comes to being in the public eye. Speaking to Variety, she recalled adverts “selling skincare that I know nothing about” by using manipulated photos of her own face with “wrinkles”. She added: “It’s really scary. Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.” She acknowledged that AI does have some advantages too, and urged people to be “open” to the benefits as well as the negative side. SHe said: “I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities. “These movies that are talking about AI — especially this one — do a really good job of showing both sides.” When it comes to ‘Atlas’, J-Lo – who plays a data analyst using AI to save the earth from an evil robot played by Simu Liu – pointed to the way both sides of the argument are shown on screen. She explained: “I think this movie does a good job of showing how AI could go incredibly wrong, and this is how it could go really right.” Jennifer recently admitted she is “worried” about the sudden rise of AI in real life, while she also discussed shooting some of the more intense scenes in the movie. She told Extra: “I am. I’m worried about that. I think it’s a scary thing and we have to kind of be careful about it and really think about where it’s going. “I thought it would be me, by myself, do the takes, be so fast, don’t have to worry about anybody else not remembering their lines... First day, you’re falling through the planets. It’s all going crazy. “Now, your leg’s broke... It was so high-intensity every day, and without having another actor kind of to give you half the energy, it’s just all you. I was exhausted. I would leave the ‘Atlas’ set limping.” 0 SHARES Share Tweet",

        "content": "The blond maniac accused of stabbing six people and suspected of killing another is a “weirdo” obsessed with working out and his looks, neighbors told The Post. Jared Ravizza, 26 — who allegedly stabbed four girls watching the movie “IF” at the theater and another two people at a McDonalds over the weekend — adopted his signature toned, tanned and blond flowing locks during Covid, three of his former Agawam, Mass. neighbors told The Post Monday. “Jared’s a weirdo,” one neighbor said. Adding that Jared and his father, psychologist Jason Ravizza, are “different, that’s for sure.” Jason is a mental health counselor with 35 years’ experience who works with children, teens and adults for a range of issues including ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, depression, low self-worth, low self-esteem and autism, according to an online profile . The father-son duo “were very close” and “huge into fitness” and would go on long walks and sunbathe together, the man said. They both grew their hair out and dyed it blond and “eventually you couldn’t tell father and son apart from a distance,” the neighbor recalled. The man recalled the two Ravizzas about two years ago abruptly “up and left” Jared’s mom, Kim. The man said he hadn’t seen either of them since Jason mysteriously showed back up at the house about a week ago, the man said. And the neighbor said the son “was standoffish” and “was never friendly” and would just look at him if he said hello to him. A second neighbor told The Post the dad was a school counselor who would pump dumbbells while walking around the neighborhood wearing a weighted vest, adding that “Jared and Jason got very bizarre.” “A drastic change took place during COVID,” the second neighbor said. “I don’t know what happened inside the house.” The Ravizza son and father suddenly started to look “like they should be living in California or Hawaii — not Massachusetts.” And a third neighbor said he also hadn’t seen the pair — whom he described as “close” — for roughly two years until Jason’s recent re-appearance. “Jared was always tanning,” the third man said. “He looked like a Californian surfer. He was a bit orange. He was obviously using something to tan himself.” And the dad would “talk up” Jared to the third neighbor “saying he’s a YouTuber and was dating a model,” the man said. After seeing more recent photos of Jared, the third neighbor noted he “looks more feminine now.” Jared appeared to be undergoing an identity change in recent months, describing himself as”she” on Instagram and adopting a more feminine look. Court papers also reveal he also officially changed his name, removing his father’s last name. The son had also been arrested in April by West Tilsbury Police on Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. — where he was then living — for allegedly attacking his dad and trashing his home, the Boston Globe reported, citing court records . Jared was forced to undergo a mental health evaluation but was eventually released from the local hospital, the outlet reported. At the time of the alleged attack, Jason told cops his son “had just had a mental break and attacked him,” the report said. The case was sent to pretrial diversion and a session is scheduled for Jared in November. Jared is facing charges of assault with intent to murder and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, among others, according to the Plymouth County District Attorney’s office. The Connecticut State Police have also said he’s a suspect in a murder investigation at a home in Deep River in the state after cops found a body there Saturday afternoon. Cops issued an alert warning the suspect was “armed and dangerous” and was carrying a 10-inch knife but then later confirmed a suspect had been arrested in the Bay State. The Saturday attacks — which were said to be unprovoked — began at the Braintree AMC theatre, when Jared attack the four girls ages, ranging 9 to 17, authorities say. After, Jared fled in a Porsche SUV driving 30 miles to Plymouth, Mass. where he then slashed two employees at a McDonald’s at a rest-stop on Route 3, officials allege. The victims were all treated for their injuries at local hospitals, but none of their injuries were deemed life-threatening. Jared took off again and totaled the car in a fiery crash in Sandwich, Mass., while being chased by state police who had been put on alert for his vehicle. He was taken into custody and is also being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, authorities say. Jared is slated to be arraigned in Plymouth District Court Tuesday.",

An Israeli airstrike killed at least 45 Palestinians and wounded dozens more - many of them women and children - on Sunday night when it hit an area of the southern Gaza Strip city which was meant to be a 'safe area' for those displaced by the war. Horrific footage from the scene showed people desperately fleeing burning tents and one man holding aloft a child whose head had been decapitated in the blast. Hundreds gathered outside Sydney Town Hall on Tuesday evening to attend an 'emergency rally' organised by the Palestine Action Group.

'Israel has committed another horrific massacre in Gaza, this time bombing displaced Palestinians who were sheltering in tents at Tal as-Sultan in Rafah, in an area designated by Israel as a \"safe area\" which would not be targeted,' rally organisers wrote. 'Over 35 have been killed, mostly women and children, with many burned alive.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted the civilian deaths were a 'tragic accident'.

It has caused international outrage.

On Monday, the White House condemned the scenes in Rafah. 'The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,' a spokesperson for President Joe Biden 's National Security Council said. 'Israel has a right to go after Hamas , and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. 'But as we've been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.' Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted 'tragic mistake' after an Israeli strike in Rafah has allegedly killed 45 people including displaced people who burned alive in tents French President Emmanuel Macron said he was 'outraged' over Israel's latest attacks. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,' he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. 'International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,' Baerbock said. As Israel has expanded its military onslaught of Rafah in recent weeks in an attempt to root out the last of the Hamas militants taking refuge in the city, more than 800,000 Palestinians have fled the city, deepening the humanitarian crisis inside Gaza.

        "description": "The new visitor charge could come into force from January 2025",
        "content": "Plans have been unveiled to introduce a visitor charge in Chester that would raise more than £1 million a year to reinvest in new events and festivals, improved services and the promotion of the city as a tourist destination to business and leisure visitors at home and abroad. Often referred to as a 'tourist tax', the new scheme would see guests staying in 27 Chester hotels pay a £2 plus VAT charge per room, per night. Tourism and business leaders behind the charge say that while visitor numbers are growing in the city, they are yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels and public funding for tourism promotion has also declined. The aim of the charge is to generate the investment needed to attract more visitors to stay in the city’s hotels, enjoy its attractions, and spend in shops, restaurants, bars and cafes. This in turn would create more jobs in the city. READ: Inside Chester Zoo's world-renowned gastropub once home to lions and chimpanzees The Oakfield, situated within the grounds of Chester Zoo, was once home to lions, chimpanzees and parrots - and has now been transformed into one of the world's most acclaimed gastropubs READ: Chester Races reveals 'evolution' plans as it looks to 'replace ageing buildings' The first phase of the proposed development work - set to run until 2039 - has been unveiled Chester hoteliers will be invited to vote on the proposed visitor charge - set out in a detailed, five-year business plan - from June 14 and July 11. If the majority vote in favour, a new Accommodation Business Improvement District (ABID) would be established with the charge introduced from January 2025. The Chester ABID plan follows the success of a similar scheme in Manchester. The ABID proposal is led by Destination Chester, a network of the city’s attractions and businesses, alongside the existing Chester City Centre Business Improvement District, and the Chester Hospitality Association. They are working with Cheshire West and Chester Council and tourism body Marketing Cheshire on the ABID proposal and ballot process. Colin Potts, Chair of Destination Chester, said: \"The Chester Accommodation BID offers the potential for a game-changing investment in our city’s visitor economy, that would allow us to build on and improve the incredible tourism offer we already provide. \"It brings together our hotels and other tourism businesses to create an ambitious long-term plan that will provide new resources to encourage more overnight visitors and longer stays – and at no cost to our businesses. \"Our visitor economy continues to recover after a few difficult years, but we are competing for attention in a hugely challenging market, nationally and internationally. This approach and funding could energise that recovery and bring a massive boost to our hotels, attractions and employers across the city.\" Carl Critchlow, Chief Executive of the Chester Business Improvement District, added: \"This exciting plan would allow us to fund new events, festivals and cultural activity for visitors to enjoy, alongside investing in improved seating, signage and maintenance to make our city centre more welcoming. We welcome a huge amount of day visitors to the city but encouraging more people, for instance to stay for the weekend, would offer a big boost to our shops, restaurants and cafes, and the night-time economy. \"Many UK cities are working on similar plans and will soon have extra money to spend on promoting and supporting tourism. It is vital that Chester does not get left behind.\" Steven Hesketh, Chair of the Chester Hospitality Association, believes its \"critical\" that hotels, attractions and wider businesses join forces to promote the city. \"We need to fund that work and in the current climate, the ABID is the only game in town,\" he said. \"That is why we have talked to our hotels and others to shape an exciting plan with clear benefits for businesses and residents alike. And we will be learning from the experience of cities including Manchester where an accommodation BID has already proved very successful.\" Andrew Stokes OBE, England Director, VisitEngland, added: \"VisitEngland has worked with Marketing Cheshire and its capable and enthusiastic team for a number of years. Delivering an ABID for Chester would significantly amplify the work of the partnership and provide the investment needed to grow the destination’s visitor economy. \"Through this ABID, we look forward to being able to feature Chester more effectively in VisitBritain’s international travel trade work programme and marketing campaigns as well as working with you to ensure the city can benefit from more business events, raising Chester’s profile both nationally and internationally.\" The Business Plan is available to read at chesterbid.co.uk/abid NEWSLETTER: Sign up for CheshireLive email direct to your inbox here",

Twomey told me the federal parliament could admit new states to the Commonwealth under section 121 of the constitution, “imposing such terms and conditions, including with respect to representation in either house of parliament, as it thinks fit.” “In addition, section 124 requires the ‘consent of the parliament’ of an affected state,” she says. “So both parliaments must consent, and the use of the term ‘parliament’ indicates that this needs to be done by legislation.” Loading One of the major problems, Twomey says, is that a new state has never been created in post-federation Australia. “This means that we have no court precedents to rely upon,” she says. “... The constitution guarantees the original states, being those that joined at the time of federation, equal Senate representation and a minimum of five seats in the House of Representatives, regardless of their population. “If a state were to be divided in half or cut into thirds, there could be a dispute as to which of the resulting states was the ‘original’ state, with guaranteed rights, or whether all parts would lose those rights. Loading “For example, if Queensland was carved up into three states, could it really be claimed that one of those three parts was the ‘original state’?” Ultimately, Miles was right last week. For all our differences – and there are many – Queensland is better together. But that’s not for southerners to decide. If north Queensland voters want to cut ties with Brisbane, then south Queensland shouldn’t stand in their way. I just suspect they’d be smarter than that.

        "content": "A drunk Cardiff City fan whose antics with a traffic cone caused Bristol City fans to be kept in the stadium after last season’s Severnside Derby has been banned from attending matches for three years. Declan Thomas was arrested after the game in Cardiff in late October last year after he was at the front of a large group of Cardiff supporters trying to get at the Bristol City fans leaving the away end of the Cardiff City Stadium. Police have released bodycam video recordings of a small part of what Thomas, 21, was doing - the video shows him picking up a traffic cone and swinging it at police. An officer said the police hope the banning order and suspended jail sentence Thomas received will ‘send a message’ to other football fans. Read next: 'Rock hard football' as legends watch the most important school match in Bristol Read more: The moment Sir Geoff Hurst joined Bristol City's walking football team Thomas, from Heol Derw in Ebbw Vale, was arrested for the disturbance on Sloper Road, which had been temporarily closed, as is routine for the end of the match, to allow fans to leave the stadium. Bristol City fans are normally held in the stadium or the stadium area for a short time after the game, but police said Thomas’ ‘drunken and aggressive behaviour’ meant there was ‘a delay in lifting the cordon, inconveniencing hundreds of fans and the wider community’. The 21-year-old pleaded guilty to affray at Cardiff Magistrate Court and was sentenced earlier this month. He was given a 14-month jail sentence, which was suspended for two years. He must also complete 150 hours of unpaid work, abstain from alcohol for 120 days and pay £337 costs and a victims’ surcharge. Looking for Bristol Court & Crime top stories in one place? Sign up for our newsletter here . Thomas was issued with a three-year Football Banning Order, which means he must not enter any football stadium in the UK, and when international matches are being played abroad - Wales away games - he must report to a police station and surrender his passport. “The overwhelming majority of people who attend the Cardiff City Stadium behave responsibly and enjoy a safe experience,” said PC Christian Evans, from South Wales Police. “But whenever there is evidence of football-related disorder we always pursue those responsible in order that appropriate action is taken. “I hope this court results sends out a clear message that similar behaviour will not be tolerated at the Cardiff City Stadium.”",

        "content": "SINGAPORE/BANGKOK – A week since she was taken to a Bangkok hospital after extreme turbulence rocked the Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight she was on, dental hygienist Karen Archer just wants “to get well and go home”. The 64-year-old Briton, who cracked three small spinal bones in the ordeal that hit Flight SQ321, was on her way from London to meet a friend for a five-day holiday in Singapore. Ms Archer is unsure what treatment she will need in the coming weeks, but she told The Straits Times on May 28 that doctors hope to remove her neck and body brace sometime in July and get her ready to fly home. The thought of returning home is also uppermost on the minds of Malaysian Eva Khoo’s injured family members. The Kuala Lumpur-based event specialist had travelled to Bangkok, where SQ321 made an emergency landing, soon after hearing that her brother and sister-in-law, and their extended family, were hurt. While their conditions have stabilised and they are now in regular wards, Ms Khoo, 47, said the thought of getting on a plane to Malaysia is unsettling them. Plane involved in SQ321 incident returns to Singapore “They want to go home, but they need time to overcome the phobia of flying. It’s not a small thing,” she said on May 27. SQ321 – one of SIA’s four daily services from London to Singapore – was cruising high above the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar on the afternoon of May 21. The jet had completed more than three-quarters of its 13-hour journey from the British capital, and a meal service was under way. Until then, the flight had been, in a passenger’s words, “quite smooth”. But, in an instant, everything changed. For more than a minute, the wide-body aircraft with 211 passengers and 18 crew members found itself in the grip of extreme turbulence, sending unrestrained passengers airborne as the plane was swept into rapid climbs and drops. The mayhem left a chaotic cabin in its wake, claiming the life of a 73-year-old British man, who was said to have suffered a heart attack, and injuring dozens more. It was SIA’s first fatal aviation accident since the SQ006 crash in Taiwan in 2000, which killed 83. A week after the ordeal forced the Boeing 777-300ER to divert to Bangkok, 34 passengers remain hospitalised in the Thai capital. All injured crew members had returned to Singapore as at May 27. As the passengers and crew come to terms with the harrowing experience, investigators are poring over data from the jet’s cockpit voice and flight data recorders to try to stitch together what happened. The SIA plane, a 16-year-old workhorse, is back at Changi Airport. It was cleared to leave Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport five days after the incident, which hogged headlines around the world for days. The flight For 62 seconds, the twin-aisle jet climbed and dropped rapidly, beginning at 3.49pm (Singapore time) on May 21, just over 10 hours after it left London’s Heathrow Airport. In this brief moment, the plane climbed from its cruising altitude of 37,000 feet to 37,400 feet, then sank rapidly to 36,975 feet before settling back onto its cruising altitude, based on data from flight-tracking site Flightradar24. Its data is derived from a global network of ground-based receivers, satellites and radars that receive flight data from aircraft transponders. The data showed that the plane first attained a climb rate of 1,664 feet per minute (fpm) – or 507m per minute, double the height of the 52-storey Capital Tower in Singapore – before descending at 1,536fpm six seconds later. It rapidly returned to a climb rate of about 900fpm three seconds later, then dropped at 1,536fpm after another 20 seconds. Passengers who were not strapped in reported being flung against the ceiling of the cabin, while others awoke on the floor to a scene of pandemonium: cries and blood, as well as a wrecked cabin, with panels dangling from the ceiling, and luggage, meal trays and food strewn about. Crew members, some of whom were seen bleeding and burnt by hot beverages, were not spared the brunt. Apart from 41 Singaporeans on board, the other 170 passengers were from 16 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and the UK. The aftermath A little under an hour after the severe turbulence struck, SQ321 touched down in Bangkok at 4.45pm (Singapore time). It was met quickly by emergency staff who dispatched the injured to hospitals. In the hours that followed, an SIA team as well as investigators from Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) reached Bangkok to help the passengers and search for answers. In Singapore, there were emotional scenes at Changi Airport early the next morning, as anxious family members were reunited with their loved ones. They were among the first batch of 143 passengers and crew flown from Bangkok to Singapore on a relief SIA flight. Meanwhile, condolences from government leaders streamed in for the family of the passenger who died. Musical theatre director Geoff Kitchen and his wife had been on their way to a six-week holiday, with plans to stop in Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and Australia. The airline’s chief executive Goh Choon Phong publicly apologised for the traumatic experience that everyone on board had gone through. The incident also swiftly forced a change in SIA’s turbulence protocols. On May 23, the airline confirmed that in-flight meal services will be suspended when the seat-belt sign is turned on. Cabin crew will also return to their seats with their seat belts fastened, as the airline adopts a more cautious approach. Its past practice was to suspend only the serving of hot drinks in turbulent conditions. The extent of the injuries wrought by the turbulence has become clearer in the days after the incident. Many had serious injuries, involving the spinal cord, brain and skull, as well as bone and muscle. A crew member had to undergo spinal surgery after injuring his head and back, while Ms Khoo’s pregnant sister-in-law was flung onto an adjacent seat, fracturing her back. At Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok, where most of the injured passengers have been hospitalised, SIA staff were tight-lipped when approached by reporters. For Ms Khoo’s loved ones, the long-term impact of their injuries is unclear. It is likely that they will have to continue receiving treatment back in Malaysia, said Ms Khoo, whose brother still has trouble walking. Mr Khoo Boo Leong, 38, was flung from his seat, hitting the overhead luggage compartment before falling onto the aisle. He was treated in intensive care before being moved into a normal ward. Beyond the physical injuries caused by the turbulence, the mental trauma may linger among the injured long after the event, with recovery potentially lasting years, psychologists said. While SIA has received plaudits for its management of the crisis and its regular updates, its response was not without hiccups. The carrier had to apologise to an injured couple after an Australian man lamented a lack of information from the airline. The man, whose wife needed a medical evacuation, said the initial absence of information included whether he would be able to make an insurance claim. Mr Goh, SIA’s chief, later met him and other passengers. Ms Khoo, too, said the issue of compensation is up in the air. Her brother and sister-in-law, who work in sales, would likely not be able to work for a few months. Doctors have also advised his sister-in-law’s father, who owns a frozen-food business, to stop strenuous activity for at least six months post-recovery, she said. “We’re still unclear on the compensation part,” she added. News agency Reuters reported that injured passengers would likely be eligible for compensation, although the sum each receives could vary widely, even for identical injuries, because of a global treaty. Spotlight on turbulence The extreme turbulence that rocked SQ321 has focused global attention on the phenomenon, which is common on flights but rarely happens on this magnitude. Five days after the incident, a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Ireland hit turbulence that reportedly lasted less than 20 seconds during food and drinks service. Twelve people on the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner were hurt. Turbulence is caused by irregular airflow motions, and can be triggered by a variety of factors, including storms and strong air currents such as jet streams. Views on what could have caused SQ321 to be hit by such extreme turbulence are divided. Some aviation experts suggested it was “clear air turbulence”, which happens without warning and is brought on by changes in wind speed, air temperature or pressure over short distances. Others said fast-building thunderstorms near the aircraft’s flight path could have been a contributory factor. This is not the first time turbulence on SIA flights has led to serious injury. ST’s checks of the public records showed there were six other instances in the past two decades investigated by the TSIB and its forerunner, the Air Accident Investigation Bureau. All six accidents, which happened between June 2004 and January 2019, involved wide-body aircraft. The resulting injuries included rib cage, thigh bone, foot and wrist fractures. It is an indication that even on big planes, such as the Boeing 777 or the double-deck Airbus A380, sudden turbulence can cause serious injury if passengers or crew members are not buckled up or are hit by flying debris. Nevertheless, people’s emotional reaction to the SQ321 incident – magnified by the media attention – does change their perception of the risk and leads them to think these cases are more common than they are, said current affairs website The Conversation. Injuries from turbulence remain extremely rare, and it is still much riskier to travel by car or motorcycle. It could, however, be months before investigators release their full findings into what caused the pandemonium on SQ321. The TSIB released its final reports on the past six turbulence-related accidents anywhere between 81⁄2 months and nearly 21⁄2 years after they happened, though most were made public within 19 months.",

        "description": "The Celtics return to the finals two years after losing to the Golden State Warriors as they search for their first NBA title since 2008.",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics clinched the Eastern Conference championship on Monday with a 105-102 win over the Indiana Pacers, sweeping the series 4-0 and booking a spot in the NBA Finals. The Celtics will face the winner of the Western Conference Finals, where the Dallas Mavericks hold a 3-0 lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of Tuesday's game four. The Celtics win in Indianapolis was their seventh straight in the post-season but they left it late against a Pacers team again without injured star guard Tyrese Haliburton. Jaylen Brown once again proved decisive. He hit a step-through to level at 102-102 with 2:40 left in the fourth, then superbly rose to block Andrew Nembhard at the rim. With 45 seconds remaining Brown found Derrick White in the corner who sank the three-point jumper that ultimately clinched the game -- and the series. Nembhard, who had 24 points, 10 assists and six rebounds for the Pacers, missed a three-pointer with 33 seconds left which would have tied the game. Brown led Boston's scoring with 29 points and Jayson Tatum had 26 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists. The Celtics return to the finals two years after losing to the Golden State Warriors as they search for their first NBA title since 2008. \"It's been nothing but a grind, we haven't skipped no steps all season,\" said Brown, named the Eastern Conference Finals MVP after averaging almost 30 points through the series. \"We've got a bunch of great guys in this locker room, tough guys. Our coaching staff has been great, front office great and now we want to take the next step,\" he added. Boston have gone 12-2 throughout the post-season as they beat the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and the Pacers to reach their 23rd NBA Finals in franchise history. Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla paid tribute to his team. \"Look at all the talent, look at the players that we have. It's really all about them, they let us coach them. They allow us to push them, they listen to us and they set the temperature of the organization every single day,\" he said. \"As a coach, the greatest gift you can have is a group of guys that trust you and that allow you to coach them,\" he added. Pacers upbeat in defeat It was the third time in the four series games that Indiana had lost after holding leads or being tied in the final minute of a game. The Pacers had led by nine with 8:28 left in the fourth but without the influential Haliburton they were unable to see the game out. \"An amazing season, a magical season. The level of fight was just tremendous all the way through this,\" said Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle. \"Circumstance never fazed them one way or the other. \"They were in this to win every possession that they could and in any game that they could, and so a lot of respect to our players and just how they conducted themselves in this series,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things accomplished this year. Expectations will be raised for next year, which is good,\" added Carlisle.",

        "content": "Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan called on Manileños to take extra precaution against the new variant of Covid-19 called \"FLiRT\" and to follow the basic health protocols. According to the mayor, the city has recently registered 10 cases, bringing the total number of Covid-19 cases in the city to 28. Lacuna-Pangan cited that many of her friends have elderly loved ones who are currently confined in various hospitals after being infected with the new variant. She said it would no longer be difficult to revert to the said health practices once again, citing how everyone had been used to the \"new normal\" protocols like wearing of face masks when in crowded areas, washing or sanitizing hands and distancing from crowds, especially from those manifesting flu-like symptoms. The mayor also emphasized the need to take the necessary precautions to ensure safety against the new variant. She reminded the public that the vaccines injected during the pandemic are not meant to address the new Covid variant. She added that the efficacy of the vaccines taken at the height of the pandemic have already waned in the passing of time. \"Unti-unti na namang tumataas ang bilang ng mga nagkakaron ng Covid sa ating lungsod (The number of people with Covid in our city is gradually increasing),\" the mayor said. In cautioning the residents, the mayor also cited news reports that Singapore recorded at least 25,000 new cases in just a week. \"Wala pa pong bagong bakuna na ibinibigay laban dito kaya mag-ingat tayong lahat, especially for those who belong to the high-risk groups like the very young and seniors, the immuno-compromised, the PWDs, those who are pregnant and those already with symptoms (There is no new vaccine given against it yet so let's all be careful, especially for those who belong to the high-risk groups like the very young and seniors, the immuno-compromised, the PWDs, those who are pregnant and those already with symptoms),\" Lacuna-Pangan said. \"Mag-ingat po kayo at tandaan n'yo, wala na tayong available na vaccine against Covid at kahit me available, hindi ito ang tamang vaccine panlaban sa bagong variant ng Covid (Be careful and remember, we no longer have available vaccine against Covid and even if it is available, it is not the right vaccine against the new variant of Covid),\" she added.",

        "content": "Labour faces left-wing fury as it's revealed race row probe into Diane Abbott was 'completed FIVE MONTHS ago' but veteran MP still doesn't know if she can be an election candidate - as Keir Starmer 'parachutes allies into ultra-safe seats' By Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Published: 11:02 BST, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 11:11 BST, 28 May 2024 e-mail 24 View comments Sir Keir Starmer is facing fury after it emerged a race row probe into Diane Abbott ended months ago - but she still hasn't been told if she can be a Labour candidate. Ms Abbott, who has been MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington since 1987, has had the Labour whip withdrawn for more than a year. She was suspended amid an investigation into her comments about Jewish people in a letter to the Observer newspaper in April last year. According to BBC Newsnight , that investigation was completed in December last year with Ms Abbott given a formal warning over her conduct. She was also reportedly required to complete an 'antisemitism awareness course'. But a source close to Ms Abbott said she is still yet to be told whether she can stand as a Labour candidate in her north London constituency at the general election. Supporters of the veteran MP on Labour's left-wing hit out at the 'outrageous' treatment of Ms Abbott by Sir Keir and party bosses. It also came amid a row over claims Sir Keir is lining up key allies to a string of safe seats after six current Labour MPs announced last-minute retirements. Last week, ex-Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - an ally of Ms Abbott - confirmed he will run as an independent candidate after being barred from standing for the party. Sir Keir Starmer is facing fury after it emerged a race row probe into Diane Abbott ended months ago - but she still hasn't been told if she can be a Labour candidate Supporters of the veteran MP on Labour's left-wing hit out at the 'outrageous' treatment of Ms Abbott by Sir Keir and party bosses Ms Abbott issued a swift apology for her remarks in April last year, after she suggested Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience 'prejudice' but are not 'subject to racism'. She was forced to sit as an independent MP in the House of Commons while a probe was launched into her remarks. The BBC reported that Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) wrote to Ms Abbott in December 2023 saying it had concluded its eight-month inquiry. It issued her with a 'formal warning' for 'engaging in conduct that was in the opinion of the NEC, prejudicial and grossly detrimental to the Labour Party', it was claimed. The NEC also reportedly said it expected Ms Abbott to undertake an 'online, e-learning module', which she is said to have completed in February. Sir Keir last week refused to be drawn on on whether Ms Abbott would be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington. 'The NEC will be coming to decisions on the final list of candidates in due course, so you'll see that when the decisions are taken,' the Labour leader said on Saturday. Labour told BBC Newsnight that it does not comment on disciplinary cases. The revelation sparked intense anger on Labour's left-wing, with a spokesperson for the Momentum group saying: 'This is outrageous news which confirms the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain's first black woman MP out of Parliament. 'For months we have been told by Keir Starmer that the process is independent and it's nothing to do with him. 'Today's revelation confirms this is another brazen lie from Keir Starmer - the investigation was concluded months ago, Diane remains a Labour member and the whip should already have been restored as a result. 'Starmer's conduct has already been insulting and demeaning to a woman he rightly called a 'trailblazer' - the first step to making amends is to restore the whip and let Diane run as the Labour candidate, as local members wish.' Meanwhile, the Guardian reported that key allies of Sir Keir are expected to be lined up as candidates in a string of safe seats. There has been a last-minute spate of Labour MPs announcing they will stand down from the Commons ahead of the 4 July general election. They include Barbara Keeley, John Cryer, John Spellar, Virendra Sharma, Kevin Brennan and Julie Elliott. Senior Labour figures close to Sir Keir - including NEC members - are tipped to chosen as candidates in the now-vacant seats.

        "content": "JUDE BELLINGHAM really is a man of his word. As a young child, kicking a ball around his hometown Stourbridge, he convinced himself and those around him that, one day, he would grace the grandest stage in European football. It was laughable talk, even for an eye-catching talent that made his Birmingham City senior debut on August 6, 2019 at the age of just 16 years and 38 days. But nearly five years on, that day has come – and no one is laughing – as Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final at Wembley this weekend. It will come as no surprise that Bellingham – who turns 21 next month – will be the main attraction under the arch come Saturday night, draped in that famous Los Blancos strip. His transformation into a global superstar has been nothing short of frightening, as are his numbers from midfield this season: 23 goals in 41 games in all competitions, with 19 coming in LaLiga. England fans have been left drooling over the prospect of seeing their new hero tearing up the Euros in a similar way this summer over in Germany. Yet for now, all eyes are on a prize that Madrid have lifted a record 14 times in their history. It feels only natural to assume a Midlands lad will soon put his stamp on No15, having already lifted the LaLiga and Super Cup trophies this term. Bellingham said: “It is a game [the Champions League final] I have been dreaming of since I started playing football. I always thought I could reach this level and win trophies. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS “I probably never realised it would happen so quickly, and probably didn’t realise the potential of my own game when it came to scoring and creating goals. “But, I understand the opportunity and not many people get to play in a game like this. I don’t want to waste a second and I won’t take it for granted. I will enjoy it. “I have been so fortunate in football and in life to have so many good people around me that have always just wanted me to enjoy the game for how it is and play with freedom. “I have always been taught to dream as big as possible. That still reflects in the way I play now.” Bellingham may be reaching for the stars, but he never forgets where he is from. He added: “I am always in touch with people from Birmingham, people from my past. They are just as excited for it as me. They have been trying to get a few more tickets...” At Madrid’s sun-kissed training ground, Bellingham is standing tall on a small metal platform, looking down at a hungry media pack who are chomping at the bit for every cough and splutter he has to offer. Bellingham’s response is telling. He smiles, cracks a few jokes and waxes lyrical in a way most seasoned pros struggle with. The pack are soon putty in his young hands. It begs the question: how on earth is he like this during one of the biggest weeks of his life and career so far? Bellingham chuckled: “This is a game I have dreamed of all my life, so it would be stupid now to get here and want to hide away from the occasion. “I know how to feel good going into big games. I have been around amazing pros and stolen little things from them. “It’s important to just be me and not worry too much about the emotional side.” In truth, Bellingham was born to deliver in these sorts of moments, but his £88.5million summer switch from Dortmund to the Bernabeu last June has taken him to even greater heights. 1981 Lawrie Cunningham vs Liverpool (L 1-0) Goals: 0 2000 Steve McManaman vs Valencia (W 3-0) Goals: 1 2002 Steve McManaman vs Bayer Leverkusen (W 2-1) Goals: 0 2014 Gareth Bale vs Atletico Madrid (W 4-1) Goals: 1 2016 Gareth Bale vs Atletico Madrid (D 1-1, 5-3 pens) Goals: 0 2017 Gareth Bale vs Juventus (W 4-1) Goals: 0 2018 Gareth Bale vs Liverpool (W 3-1) Goals: 2 He has Madrid’s eyebrow-raising managerial maestro Carlo Ancelotti to thank, the Italian coach pushing the Three Lions star higher up the pitch straight away. Take note, Gareth Southgate . Bellingham said: “From the first day I arrived [Ancelotti] said you’re going to be playing a little bit higher. It was not something I had done so consistently before. “But, I was really excited by the prospect of it, being closer to goal, being free in the top third. In the end, it was a decent decision. He knows what he is doing.” It is fitting that Bellingham gets to face off against his old pals at Dortmund, where he spent three fine years. He received a text from one of those in Jadon Sancho shortly after Real’s semi-final triumph over Bayern Munich, a player he \"respects a lot\". A wall surrounding a training pitch at Madrid’s base reads: “This is Grandeza”, which translates to “greatness”. Should Bellingham climb the Wembley steps and lift the Champions League, that slogan may well apply solely to him.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Closing arguments in Donald Trump 's historic hush money trial are set to begin Tuesday morning, giving prosecutors and defense attorneys one final opportunity to convince the jury of their respective cases before deliberations begin. Jurors will undertake the unprecedented task of deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of felony criminal charges stemming from hush money payments tied to an alleged scheme to buy and bury stories that might wreck Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. At the heart of the charges are reimbursements paid to Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment that was paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels in exchange for not going public with her claim about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors say the payments to Cohen, Trump's then-lawyer, were falsely logged as “legal expenses” to hide the true nature of the transactions. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records , charges which are punishable by up to four years in prison. Closing arguments are expected to last all day Tuesday, with jury deliberations beginning as soon as Wednesday. The case is the first of Trump's four indictments to go to trial as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The other cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It’s unclear whether any of them will reach trial before the November election. Currently: — Here’s what every key witness said at Donald Trump’s hush money trial — As Trump’s hush money trial nears end, would-be spectators camp out for days to get inside — Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms — Trump hush money case: A timeline of key events — Key players: Who’s who at Trump’s hush money criminal trial — Hush money, catch and kill and more: A guide to unique terms used at Trump’s trial Here's the latest: With closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial expected to get underway Tuesday morning, jurors have a weighty task ahead of them — deciding whether to convict the former U.S. president of some, all or none of the 34 felony counts he's charged with. To convict Trump of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors must convince jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that he not only falsified or caused business records to be entered falsely but also did so with intent to commit or conceal another crime . Any verdict must be unanimous. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven’t proved Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. New York also has a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, which requires proving only that a defendant made or caused the false entries, but it is not part of Trump’s case and will not be considered by jurors. For many Americans, Memorial Day weekend was a moment to remember the sacrifices of U.S. military personnel and to unplug from the bustle of daily life. For others, it was a chance to snag a prime spot in line for entry into Donald Trump's hush money trial ahead of Tuesday's closing arguments. Last Friday afternoon saw several people camped out — including professional line sitters with pup tents — for a chance to see the tail end of the historic proceedings up close and personal. Though most of the seats inside the courtroom are reserved for lawyers, members of Trump’s entourage, security personnel and journalists, a few are open to the general public. The former president's Manhattan trial has drawn visitors from all over, including students from local schools and plenty of out-of-towners. Closing arguments in Donald Trump's hush money trial are expected to begin on Tuesday, marking the beginning of the end of the historic proceedings that kicked off in April. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will make their final pitch to jurors, hoping to sway them in one direction or another after more than four weeks of witness testimony. Following the conclusion of closing arguments, which are expected to last all day, Judge Juan M. Merchan will spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president’s guilt or innocence. Jurors could begin deliberations as early as Wednesday.",

        "content": "Paul Menard’s day went from frustration to triumph at the Trans Am Series presented by Pirelli Memorial Day Classic at Lime Rock Park, as he overcame pre-race technical issues to earn his second victory of the season. Menard nearly missed the grid because his car wouldn’t start on the pre-grid, but a recovery by his 3GT team allowed him to keep his fourth-place starting position. From there, raw speed and the troubles of others allowed him to take the lead early in the race and never look back, taking the checkered flag at the Lime Rock SpeedTour. Tomy Drissi (No. 8 Franklin Road Apparel Chevrolet Camaro) started the race from the lead after earning his first pole position with his own team, Drissi Motorsports, in this morning’s qualifying session, just barely beating out three-time champion Chris Dyson (No. 16 GYM WEED Ford Mustang). When the green flag waved, Drissi smoothly pulled ahead of his competitors, while third-place starter Adam Andretti (No. 17 Top Liner/Go Share Chevrolet Camaro) made contact with Dyson in Turn 1, causing Dyson to spin and drop to last in class. Drissi held the lead for the first two laps, with Andretti challenging behind him, but by lap three, Andretti was able to make the pass and take control of the race. Just one lap later, Drissi faded back to third, and Andretti put a wheel off the track, losing momentum and allowing Menard to take over the point position in his No. 3 Menards/Masterforce Tools Ford Mustang. Once Menard got out in front, he flawlessly ticked off the laps, opening a bigger and bigger lead over Andretti. Meanwhile, Dyson was making blazing-fast laps to recover from his spin, and he worked his way up to fourth by lap seven. At a 15-second disadvantage behind the leaders, Dyson chipped away at the gap. On lap 23, he passed Drissi for the third position, and then put Andretti in his sights. Menard continued to dominate out front, but Andretti fell farther behind the leader, while Dyson stalked the second-place driver. Dyson finally caught Andretti on lap 58 of 68, allowing just 10 laps for him to pursue Menard, who was still nearly 10 seconds ahead. Although Dyson was able to cut down Menard’s advantage to six seconds, a stopped car on the track brought out the yellow flag with three laps to go, forcing the race to end under caution and preventing Dyson from making any more forward progress. Menard took the checkered flag, followed by Dyson, Andretti and Drissi. Amy Ruman, who had experienced damage early in the race in her No. 23 McNichols Co. Chevrolet Corvette, finished fifth. “This is a great track; it’s a bucket list track for me,” said Menard. “I am just in awe of the fans here, the crowd. I’ve always heard the Lime Rock crowd was the best. There’s some great road courses in America that we get to go to because of the veterans and our military, who keep us safe. First and foremost, we get to do this and have fun, but we don’t do this without them. I got to meet a gentleman, Chris Ross over here, he’s a veteran Army Ranger. We spent some time together this weekend. There are guys like Chris all across America that live a different life, protecting us. Hats off to everyone at 3GT, they gave me a hell of a race car. On to Pittsburgh to try to do it again.” RESULTS Notes of Interest: XGT The XGT race was a battle between Ricky Sanders (No. 43 BridgeHaul/Bennett/PitBoxes.com Mercedes AMG GT3) and 2023 champion Danny Lowry (No. 42 Bennett/BridgeHaul/PitBoxes.com Mercedes AMG GT3). Sanders had a great start to the race, and in the opening laps, he pulled ahead to a gap that was insurmountable for Lowry without a caution. Sanders led from green flag to checkers, taking his first win of the 2024 season. “That car is just awesome,” said Sanders. “After the first practice when we got in the car, I came in and I said, ‘this is the most awesome car I’ve ever driven.’ And I’ve got to thank Danny [Lowry] for that, because I was used to driving just regular old club-style cars, and Danny has allowed me to run these really nice FIA GT3 spec cars that are just like works of art to drive. I’m really enjoying that. “We wanted to have a better race between the two of us, but I caught a couple of holes on that very first lap and we had such a gap that we never got back together. But maybe on the next one, we’ll be able to run door to door together and see how it comes out. It’s really awesome having the Wreaths Across America people here. Having them here this weekend is just a real honor and I’m glad to be part of that program too.” SGT In SGT, Jenn Krpata in the No. 93 Island Trees Auto Chevrolet Camaro took the green flag leading her class, but Richard Forsythe had an incredibly fast No. 58 GSpeed/Sambuca Restaurant Chevrolet Corvette and was able to pass Krpata by lap seven. Forsythe led Krpata while Kaylee Bryson (No. 02 Logical Systems Inc./Sam Pierce Chevrolet Corvette) struggled in third following a qualifying crash that forced her to start last. Bryson had to retire due to overheating after the race’s halfway point, so it was just Krpata and Forsythe battling for the race win. It appeared that Forsythe would wrap up the victory, but on lap 65, he suddenly lost power, coming to a stop on the racing surface. His misfortune allowed Krpata to make the pass to earn her first-career Trans Am victory, and also forced the race to end under yellow-flag conditions. “This is insane; this is absolutely a dream come true,” said Krpata. “I can’t believe it. You know, we went from regional racing as a father-daughter team to a Trans Am winner. It’s insane. I just had to push and make it through. I actually remember coming here as a kid at four years old. It’s crazy. It’s a weird, weird feeling. We’re coming home, and it’s great to be here. I enjoy the track very much.” GT Joey DaSilva (No. 67 Ave Motorsports Toyota Supra) was the fastest GT qualifier and led the class for every lap of the race. Chris Coffey, who has dominated so far this season in his No. 97 Norwood Auto Italia/Traffic Grafix Maserati MC GT4, appeared to be in a position to challenge DaSilva in the end, but a lapped car in another class made contact with him and interrupted his forward progress. Coffey crossed the finish line second behind DaSilva, while Michael Saia (No. 13 KMC/Rapid Performance Management/Motul Porsche GT3 Cup 997.1) finished third. “The first half of this race, I just tried to kill my tires as much as I possibly could to get away from this guy [Coffey],” said DaSilva. “And of course, halfway through, I start seeing him come down that front straight a little bit closer every time I crossed that finish line. So, I just counted down the laps. My driving coach kept counting them down. I was like ‘Oh no, he’s too close.’ But thankfully, that double yellow came out and solidified everything. “It was a great run, man, thank you guys for having me. Thanks to the vets. Thank you to my parents, my daughter, my son for coming out, my father-in-law, my driving coach Roger Cody, Tony Ave, Ave Motorsports. Thank all of you guys, seriously.”",

        "content": "By Joseph Kithitu NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – In recent months, rains have been ravaging Kenya resulting in devastating floods that swept across the country leaving an indelible mark on the country’s landscape and its people. From the sprawling plains of the Maasai Mara to the bustling streets of Nairobi, the effects of climate change are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. This situation is not unique to Kenya, our neighbours in Tanzania and Burundi have faced a similar situation. As we grapple with these environmental challenges, we must rethink our approach to travel and tourism in the region. Ecotourism, with its emphasis on sustainability and community benefits, offers a path forward that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change while preserving Kenya’s rich natural heritage. The recent floods in Kenya are a stark reminder of our vulnerability to climate change. It has resulted in significant challenges for local and urban communities, disrupted wildlife habitats, and destroyed vital tourism infrastructure. Experts warn that such extreme weather patterns are likely to become more common as global temperatures rise. This not only threatens Kenya’s biodiversity but also its tourism industry, which is a significant component of the economy considering it was rated the best performing sector in Kenya, by the government a few months ago. Ecotourism should be regarded as a critical solution to the challenges affecting tourism sites as a result of the adverse effects of climate change. By focusing on conservation, education, and community engagement, ecotourism ensures that tourism activities do not harm the environment but rather contribute to its preservation. Take, for instance, the Maasai Mara where many establishments were partially or fully submerged. This resulted in disruptions in tourism activities, displaced animals and loss of revenue to the local community managing tourism activities while also protecting wildlife. How can we address the issue? Tourism operators must integrate sustainable practices into their operations. As industry stakeholders, we need to take the lead in supporting and initiating conservation projects. We have an opportunity to implement green practices, such as minimizing carbon footprints and supporting local conservation projects. We can encourage travellers to play a significant role in promoting sustainability by making conscious choices. Opting for eco-friendly lodges, reducing plastic use, and participating in conservation activities are just a few ways they can contribute. At Hemingways Travel we have pioneered this by deploying tools that can calculate the carbon emission activities undertaken by the clients. We have also partnered with accredited bodies for carbon credit offset where organizations can offset their credits through payments or participation in activities that generate carbon credits. Sustainable tourism not only protects the environment but also brings substantial benefits to local communities. It creates jobs, funds education, and healthcare initiatives, and reduces reliance on unsustainable practices such as poaching. For instance, the success of marine conservation efforts in Watamu is largely due to the involvement of local communities in ecotourism activities. As we navigate the challenges posed by climate change, it is clear that sustainable tourism must be at the heart of our response. By embracing ecotourism, we can protect Kenya’s natural treasures, support local communities, and build a resilient future.

        "content": "Loading... Loading... In a recent interview, macro strategist Henrik Zeberg made a striking forecast that Bitcoin BTC/USD could experience a significant surge in value, alongside his prediction of an impending U.S. recession. What Happened : During a discussion on the Bloor Street Capital YouTube channel, Zeberg predicted a substantial rally for Bitcoin, expecting it to soar over 64% from its present value by the third quarter of 2024, The Daily Hodl reported on Tuesday. Zeberg reaffirmed his previous projection of Bitcoin reaching a price range between $110,000 and $115,000, indicating that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of an uptrend that was initiated on May 20. He envisions a pattern of surges and periods of consolidation leading to this price target. Zeberg also shared his outlook on the broader economy, foreseeing a U.S. recession by the end of 2024. He anticipates the recession will begin in the last quarter, with the stock market reaching its peak shortly before, likely in Q3. See Also: Altcoins ‘Entering Textbook Markup’ As Crypto Analyst Predicts Major Rally Why It Matters : Zeberg’s predictions arrive amid a backdrop of varying opinions on Bitcoin’s future. Just days before Zeberg’s interview, another crypto analyst suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1 million within the next 10 to 18 months , emphasizing the nascent stage of Bitcoin’s story. Conversely, another analysis presented a more cautious view, questioning whether Bitcoin had truly escaped the “danger zone” and predicting a potential dip in its value. This contrasting viewpoint underscores the volatile and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading 1.87% lower at $68,146.30, according to Benzinga Pro .

Alana Dredge posted a heartfelt message on her public Instagram page in honour of her tragic partner Oliver White, whose death is being investigated by Surrey Police. His body was discovered the day after two unarmed thieves entered the 247 Kettles store in affluent Richmond in south-west London last Saturday and stole a number of high value watches. Police later confirmed that the victim, from Surrey, was found dead on Sunday evening and his next of kin have been informed. Ms Dredge has now shared on Instagram a picture of herself and her partner on holiday - saying it was 'our last photo together', taken just a fortnight ago. Alana Dredge has posted online tributes to her boyfriend Oliver White after he was found dead on Sunday evening after police were called to Shepperton in Surrey She wrote of loving him 'more than I can put into words', following the tragic news which came a day after he was the victim of a robbery in Richmond, south-west London This was the shocking moment two men put a watch dealer in a chokehold inside his south-west London store before robbing him - the Metropolitan Police is now investigating She wrote: 'My darling boy I can’t believe you're gone. This was our last photo together. This was only 2 weeks ago and now I’ll never see you again. 'The last thing you said to me was I love you. I will cherish you forever, being with you was the best 6 years of my life. I hope you are reading this from up there, I will continue to make you proud.' She described how the pair were saving to buy their first home together as she vowed to 'buy the house you exactly wanted and it'll be your home'. Ms Dredge, whose account describes her as a hair extension specialist, revealed she was still sending WhatsApp messages to Mr White's phone - saying she was 'hoping this is all a nightmare and you'll reply'. She went on to say: 'I don’t know how I’ll do life without you, my whole world has ended. 'My life will never be the same again I can’t explain how much I love you. I will never stop loving you - I’m so numb I can’t cry anymore. 'I have never felt pain like this, you were the only person that could give me comfort like no other and make all my pain go away. 'Now you’re not here I don’t know what I’m going to do. I love you Oliver more than I can put into words.' Surrey Police today said they were called to a property in Shepperton on Sunday shortly after 8.15pm, 'following a report of a concern for safety'. The force added: 'A man in his 20s was sadly pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin are aware and are being supported. 'Enquiries are still ongoing, but his death is not thought to be suspicious.' Alana Dredge shared on Instagram this photograph of herself with boyfriend Oliver White, describing it as their 'last photo together' taken two weeks ago Friends shared messages of support and sympathy in response to her online tribute The incident, which took place in a dealership in the affluent area of Richmond in south-west London on Saturday at about 2.50pm, saw a pair run off with a large collection of watches One worker at Parkshot House, where 247 Kettles is based on the third floor, today told MailOnline of Mr White: 'He was a lovely man and always had time for a chat. Everybody really liked him. ‘We only heard this morning about the robbery and that Oli had died. 'I still can’t believe it. It’s very shocking and has left us very upset. Everybody is talking about it because this is quite a safe, middle-class area and you don’t expect something like this to happen.' Staff at the watch company did not arrive for work on Tuesday morning. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson has said: 'We are aware of the death of a man in Surrey on Sunday, 26 May. This is being investigated by officers from Surrey Police and is not being treated as suspicious at this time. 'The man who died was the victim of a robbery at a jewellers in Richmond on Saturday, 25 May. 'We ask that the privacy of his family is respected at this difficult time.' The robbery, which took place last Saturday at about 2.50pm, involved the pair of thieves running off with a large loot of watches. In the attack, the two men can be seen initially sitting at the other side of the desk to the victim, who appears to be fixing a white watch for them.

The other, wearing blue jeans, a blue and white T-shirt and sunglasses on the top of his head, is stood leaning over the desk while the victim is distracted by the timepiece. The man on his feet then suddenly grabs the dealer by both arms and violently pushes him across the room on his chair into a corner. His accomplice then dashes to a counter in the store and sweeps up a handful of items - all while the other keeps the victim in a chokehold. As the dealer tries to wriggle free, the man with the sunglasses seems to tighten his grasp to make sure he does not escape. The staff member watches on helplessly as the other robber crams the watches into a bag, which is on the back of the man who has him in the headlock. The victim then stops resisting as the rucksack continues to be filled with items from the store's shelves. The pair are initially sitting at the other side of the desk to the victim, who appears to be fixing a white watch for them The man on his feet then suddenly grabs the dealer by both arms and violently pushes him across the room on his chair into a corner As the dealer tries to wriggle free, the man with the sunglasses seems to tighten his grasp to make sure he does not escape The robber even grabs a couple of things to steal from the table, over which the dealer was initially fixing the watch. Throughout, the man with the sunglasses appears to be speaking to the victim while he keeps him in a firm chokehold. The other robber meanwhile keeps piling items into the bag and his accomplice turns his attention away from the dealer and starts speaking to him. Read More Rise of the 'Rolex rippers': How luxury watch thieves operating in London's West End are putting wealthy owners off flaunting their wrist candy - and sending price of secondhand timepieces plummeting The bag-filler then yanks open cabinets and pulls open drawers to grab more watches and add to the loot. At one point, he seems to take more than he can carry and drops an item onto the shop floor. The pair appear to decide that they have taken enough and, after a hand gesture from the man with sunglasses, the other robber takes a handful of zip ties from the rucksack and lays them on the table before the video ends. This comes after it was revealed that a machete-wielding thug who threatened to chop off singer Aled Jones's arm in front of his teenage son unless he 'f***ing* handed over his £17,000 Rolex watch was handed a two-year training and detention order. It forms part of a wider rise of luxury watch muggings in London , which is putting wealthy owners off flaunting their expensive purchases - and may be contributing to collapsing demand for high-end timepieces. High-profile businessman Devin Narang recently used a summit with Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy to warn Indian executives were putting off visiting London due to their fears about falling victim to muggers. The renewable energy entrepreneur raised concerns about watch thefts in upmarket areas. He said in February: 'People are being mugged in the heart of London, in Mayfair - all CEOs in India have had an experience of physical mugging and the police not responding.' London's street crime epidemic last year saw 'theft from a person' offences - which includes stealing watches, handbags and mobile phones - soar by 27 per cent compared to the previous 12 months. Read More Indian chief execs are too scared to visit London in case they are hit by Mayfair Rolex robbers as Britain and New Delhi haggle over post-Brexit trade deal Metropolitan Police figures show there were 72,756 of those crimes reported in the year to 2023, up from 57,468 in 2022. And London's Westminster district - which includes well-heeled Mayfair - saw such crimes leap by an above-average 40 per cent, with 25,650 rather than 18,310. There were more than 300 watches stolen in the West End alone worth a total of nearly £4million in the six months to October 2022. In April that year former British boxing champion Amir Khan was accosted by a gunman who made off with his custom-made £72,000 watch as he left a restaurant in east London. Moped and e-bike gangs have been identified as prolific culprits - while not only watches but also mobile phones are increasingly being seized, including in a brazen raid from a woman near London's Regent's Park last month . Worldwide, the number of watches recorded as lost or stolen has more than tripled over the last 12 months , the Watch Register database revealed last week. New figures from the business showed the value of registered stolen and lost luxury watches has risen to £1.5billion - up by 236 per cent compared to a year ago.

In a statement, the force said: 'The incident happened at around 14.50 on Saturday, 25 May in Kew Road. 'Two men, who were not armed, entered the shop and assaulted a member of staff before stealing a quantity of high value watches. 'Anyone who recognises these two men or has information that could assist police is asked to call 101 or \"X\" @MetCC and quote CAD4555/25May. 'You can also provide information anonymously to the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.'

Pope Francis , 87, was claimed to have said 'there is too much of an air of f*****ry' in the church, translated from Italian, in comments made last week and first circulated by Italian tabloid news website Dasgopia on Monday. Bishops at the meeting were reportedly taken aback by the language the pontiff used to make the statement - the derogatory word 'frociaggine', which roughly translates to f*****ry. Italian news agency Adnkronos, citing sources, reported that the Pope said in the speech: 'Look: there is already an air of f*****ry around that is not good. There is today's culture of homosexuality with respect to those who have a homosexual orientation [who] are better off not being accepted [into the seminary].' The remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera , but represents a huge step back for campaigners after prolonged efforts to reform the church's position on LGBTQ + rights. Pope Francis is pictured during a meeting with the Italian Bishops' Conference at the Vatican The comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference Pope Francis attends a Mass in St Peter's Square for the first World Children's Day on May 26 Remaining silent on the matter, the Pope has not posted on Twitter/X since Monday. The Vatican's Press Bulletin also has not been updated since yesterday, referencing a meeting with a delegation of Buddhist Monks in Thailand in which the Pope called for the building of a 'more inclusive world'. As of Tuesday morning, Vatican News - set up by order of Pope Francis in 2015 with the Secretariat for Communication - reported this morning that the Pope today met with World Children's Day artists and volunteers in Rome. Italian media has quoted the Pope as having said: 'Look, there is already an air of f*****ry going around that isn't good. 'There is a culture today of homosexuality, because of which those with a homosexual orientation are better off not being welcomed [into the seminary]. 'It is very difficult for a boy who has this tendency not to fall [into sin] because they come [to the seminary] thinking that the life of the priest can support them, but then they fall during the work of the ministry.' Some suggested the comments were an honest translation mistake for the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he 'did not know' how offensive the word was. But the allegations could spell a significant step back for the church after years spent shifting its position on LGBTQ+ matters. When asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?' Last year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church. However, the Pope delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject anyone suspected of being homosexual. Political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis's native language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past. He has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support. It widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions. Francesco Lepore, a former priest who is now a gay rights activist, said he was 'stunned' by the comments allegedly made by Francis, who is also known by his birth name Jorge Mario Bergoglio. 'Despite being accustomed by now to the type of direct language on the part of Bergoglio, speaking of 'f*****ry' in the seminaries seems more like a bar and a tavern than a Pontiff,' he told la Repubblica. 'This expression would never have appeared on the lips of Paul VI, John Paul II or Benedict XVI, who also took damning positions towards homosexuality. He added: 'The Pope is right that the number of homosexual seminarians and clerics is very high. But the simplicity of language has nothing to do with vulgarity.' Reports about the pontiff's remarks at the meeting come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere. The Pope was pictured today (right) at a World Children's Day event in Rome Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past The paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.' This, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.' However, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.' Francis's latest remarks seemingly suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether. The Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion. The 2005 Vatican document, released under Pope Benedict XVI and endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called 'gay culture.'' There is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue and the Vatican has not commented.

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE : Tom Bradby , the man most likely to host election night coverage for ITV , is also working with the UK commercial broadcaster to adapt his book Secret Service . The ITV News anchor has teamed with The Last King of Scotland producer Potboiler Productions to reimagine his 2019 espionage thriller. Bradby and screenwriter Jemma Kennedy ( Captain Webb ) are writing the five-part series. Secret Service delves into the long-standing tensions between Russia and the UK, examining Kremlin interference in British politics. The story follows Kate Henderson, head of the Russia desk for British intelligence service MI6, who gathers evidence that a UK politician is possibly a Kremlin asset. Related Stories News British Broadcasting Bosses Band Together To Urge Passing Of Media Bill Before Parliament Is Dissolved For General Election News ITV Set To Make Dozens Of Layoffs When a young woman is brutally murdered with an election looming, Kate races against time to discover the identity of the politician. Her reputation and family are on the line as the clock is ticking. Gail Egan and Andrea Calderwood executive produce Secret Service for Potboiler. The drama, produced in association with All3Media International, was commissioned by ITV’s Polly Hill and Helen Ziegler. Production gets underway next year in London and Malta. Bradby said he hopes the series will be “compelling and enthralling,” adding: “I felt the themes were achingly topical when I wrote the novel – and they have only become more so since.” Egan and Calderwood added: “Tom and Jemma have created a bold and compelling drama that looks behind the curtain at the real world of modern-day spies and the machinations happening in the corridors of power.” Bradby wrote the 2014 ITV drama The Great Fire , while his first novel Shadow Dancer was adapted into a film of the same name starring Andrea Riseborough, Clive Owen, and Gillian Anderson. Bradby is repped by TV agent Valerie Hoskins Associates and literary agent Mark Lucas of The Soho Agency.",

        "description": "Ad Standards, the industry organization that regulates advertisements in Canada, ruled against one of the country's largest pro-fossil fuel advocacy groups for spreading disinformation about the harmful climate impacts of liquified natural gas (LNG), according to a confidential decision.",
        "content": "The industry organization that regulates advertisements in Canada has ruled against one of Canada's largest pro-fossil fuel advocacy groups for spreading disinformation about the harmful climate impacts of liquified natural gas (LNG), according to a confidential decision. Leaked to the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE), the unanimous ruling by Ads Standards found that Canada Action, a non-profit that promotes the oil and gas industry, had \"distorted the true meaning of statements made by professionals or scientific authorities\" and created an \"overall misleading impression\" that LNG is climate-friendly. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * Climate scientists are clear that extracting and burning fossil fuels, including LNG, must stop to prevent exacerbating the climate and pollution crises. Canada Action's bright green ads claiming falsely that “LNG will reduce emissions” have been plastered on buses, billboards and in major newspapers throughout the country for months, primarily in major urban centres in Ontario and B.C. The decision dates to January 30, 2024 but was only made public Tuesday after being leaked to CAPE this month. However, because Ads Standards has no enforcement authority over advertisers and must keep its rulings confidential, Canada Action has flouted the decision and continues to run the campaign despite the ruling. Ads from Canada Action, a non-profit that promotes the #LNG industry, were found to be 'misleading' by Ad Standards Canada, but the ads ran in print and on billboards because the regulator has no enforcement authority, leaked documents reveal. Unlike other ad industry self-regulators like the British Advertising Standards Authority and the National Advertising Division in the U.S., decisions by Canada's Ads Standards are not made public. \"This ruling tells us what we already know, which is that Canada Action is completely greenwashing LNG as something good for the planet and good for us when it's not,\" said CAPE president Melissa Lem. \" The fact that Ads Standards has ruled that they've committed an infraction and that they continue to run these greenwashing ads for months later should be a mark of shame.\" The advertising push comes as B.C. ramps up its LNG, despite warnings from the International Energy Agency that demand for the product is poised to tumble in coming years. Moreover, if B.C. pursues all of the LNG currently planned for the province, the industry would account for about 40 per cent of the province's 2030 carbon budget. LNG extraction – or fracking – also comes with major health impacts , including higher rates of premature birth, asthma flares, childhood leukemia, heart failure, and mortality, according to Margaret McGregor, a doctor and health researcher. This is in addition to the health risks posed by natural gas use and extreme weather – like wildfire smoke and intense heat – exacerbated by the climate crisis. The findings come amidst growing frustration with disinformation efforts by fossil fuel companies. Earlier this year, CAPE and several other environmental and health groups announced they are suing FortisBC , the province's natural gas utility, for misleading ad campaigns. The federal Competition Bureau is also investigating the Pathways Alliance, a coalition of Canada's major oil and gas companies, for misleading advertisements. In Ottawa, NDP MP Charlie Angus last year tabled a private member's bill that would prohibit fossil fuel advertising Canada-wide, similar to measures passed in other countries like France. That proposal generated huge backlash that saw Angus weathering death threats and other insults. The Ads Standards ruling highlights the need for more stringent regulations on fossil fuel greenwashing, Lem said. Canada Action's decision to ignore the ruling and continue running the problematic ads across the country “underlines the fact that the fossil fuel industry is aware of the fact that it's spreading disinformation yet does nothing about it,\" she said. \"It follows decades and decades of the fossil fuel industry continuing to spread disinformation to drive its own profits and tilt policy in its favour.\"",

        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) smartphone shipments in China surged by 52% in April compared to the previous year, continuing the rebound observed in the previous month, according to data from a Chinese government-affiliated research firm. The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) reported that shipments of foreign-branded phones in China rose by 52% in April, reaching 3.495 million units, up from 2.301 million units a year earlier. While the data did not specifically name Apple, the company is the leading foreign phone maker in China's smartphone market, suggesting that the marked increase in foreign-branded shipments is largely due to Apple's performance. The significant rise comes after a weak start to the year in the world's largest smartphone market, where Apple faces growing competition from local high-end rivals like Huawei. In March, Apple's shipments in China increased by 12%, a notable recovery from the first two months of 2024, during which the company saw a 37% drop in sales. The sales momentum may continue in May, driven by Apple's aggressive discounting campaign on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. This price cut, twice as large as the discount offered in February, follows Huawei's introduction of its new high-end smartphone series, the Pura 70, last month, and the launch of the Mate 60 in August.",

Since the beginning of the war, Leumi has significantly expanded the relief program, publishing its own relief program to both business and retail customers from across Israel, with an emphasis on residents of the southern and northern confrontation lines, with the aim of assisting them as much as possible during these complex times. The reliefs to eligible customers included, among others: full exemption from mortgage payments, exemption from loan repayments for retail customers and small businesses, aid funds totaling more than NIS 1.25b. ($340m.), exemption from common current account fees, exemption from charges on current account overdraft and more.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, Barclays (LON: BARC ) updated its stance on DuPont (NYSE: DD ) shares, increasing the price target to $85 from the previous $81 while maintaining an Equalweight rating. The adjustment follows DuPont's announcement of a corporate break-up, which has sparked discussions about the appropriate valuation multiple for the company. The firm noted that the departure of DuPont's CEO, Edward Breen, was seen as sudden, and the anticipated 18 to 24-month timeframe for the break-up process could result in the company's shares remaining relatively stable in the near term. Despite the changes and the potential for debate around the company's valuation, Barclays opted to retain its Equalweight rating on DuPont shares. DuPont, a conglomerate known for its diverse range of products and services, is undergoing significant changes that could influence its stock performance. The break-up of the company is expected to be a complex endeavor, taking up to two years to complete. The price target adjustment by Barclays reflects a modest optimism about DuPont's future financial performance following the restructuring. The target increase suggests that Barclays sees some potential for growth or realignment in DuPont's value post-break-up, despite the near-term uncertainties. InvestingPro Insights As DuPont (NYSE:DD) embarks on its corporate restructuring, the company's financial metrics and strategic maneuvers offer investors a clearer picture of its potential trajectory. According to InvestingPro data, DuPont boasts a solid market capitalization of $33.92 billion and has maintained a steady dividend yield of 1.87%, with a recent dividend growth of 5.56%. This is a testament to the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders, a fact further underscored by its record of 54 consecutive years of dividend payments—an InvestingPro Tip that highlights the firm's reliability in rewarding investors. Another noteworthy InvestingPro Tip is the company's strong performance over the last three months, with a price total return of 16.5%. This reflects the market's positive response to DuPont's strategic decisions, potentially including the planned break-up. Additionally, the fact that DuPont's shares are trading near their 52-week high, at 99.79% of this value, indicates robust investor confidence, aligning with Barclays' increased price target. Given these insights, investors may find value in exploring additional InvestingPro Tips for DuPont, which can be accessed through the InvestingPro platform.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsReddit has come out of the gate strong since its initial public offering in March of this year. And the company is likely just getting started.The post Reddit Stock Alert: The Social Media IPO That’s Defying the Odds appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ) has come out of the gate strong since its initial public offering in March of this year, and Reddit stock still is a serious buy. The online message board and discussion forum company that’s home to the notorious WallStreetBets subreddit, has seen its share price rise 20% since its first day of trading on March 21. Not only did Reddit execute a successful IPO, but in the two months since going public, the company has issued strong quarterly financial results and announced a new strategic partnership that’s likely to power future growth. A Solid IPO Reddit pulled off one of the largest and most successful IPOs since before the Covid-19 pandemic in 2019. Because of strong demand, the company could price its IPO at $34 a share, the top end of the expected range. The stock offering raised $519 million for the company and valued it at $6.5 billion. Reddit sold 15.28 million shares in the IPO offering, while existing shareholders and employees sold another 6.72 million shares. Wall Street was watching the IPO closely not only because of its size, but also because it was the first stock market debut of a social media company since Pinterest (NYSE: PINS ) went public in 2019. Reddit had long delayed its IPO because of the pandemic and subsequent bear market in 2022. Concerns were alleviated as RDDT stock made a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange and, despite some volatility in the first few days, has managed to hold on to its gains. Encouraging Earnings Six weeks after its market debut, Reddit reported its first quarterly financial results as a publicly traded company. The results were so good that they sent Reddit stock up 15% in a single trading day. The company reported a loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 that was expected among analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $243 million, which was far ahead of the $212.8 million expected on Wall Street. The still unprofitable company said its sales rose 48% from a year earlier. Reddit also reported $222.7 million in online advertising revenue for the quarter, up nearly 40% year over year. The company had 82.7 million daily active users at the end of Q1, more than the 76.6 million expected by analysts. Average revenue per user rose 8% to $2.94. Looking ahead , management said they expect revenue of $240 million to $255 million for the current second quarter, topping expectations of $224 million. By all accounts, Reddit’s first print was a home run. Push Into AI Most recently, Reddit has announced a new strategic partnership with privately held artificial intelligence startup company OpenAI . News of the partnership drove Reddit stock up another 11% in one day. The OpenAI deal should attract more users to Reddit’s platform through AI-enhancements. OpenAI has also agreed to become an advertising partner of Reddit and run ads on its message boards. Advertising is important as Reddit generates nearly 100% of its revenue from online ads on its message boards. The partnership also allows Reddit to leverage OpenAI’s technology , including its ChatGPT platform, to build tools and features that will enhance Reddit’s content. The company has said it plans to use AI to attract more eyeballs and build on its more than 80 million daily active users. For its part, OpenAI will use Reddit’s posts to train it artificial intelligence models, including ChatGPT. Buy Reddit Stock It’s still early days. But Reddit has managed to impress with a successful IPO and a strong earnings print. Those are two hurdles that most newly public companies stumble over. Reddit is adapting AI technologies and using them to its advantage. The partnership with OpenAI should provide a tailwind for the company and its share price. For all these reasons, it makes sense to be bullish on the social media concern. Reddit stock is a buy .

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBiotech penny stocks offer the chance to triple your investments and require an appetite for risk in order to capture returns.The post 7 Penny Biotech Stocks to Triple Your Investment appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "One of the oldest maxims in investing is that higher risk produces greater returns. That maxim holds particularly true across penny biotech stocks. Developing therapeutics to cure diseases is a complex business model fraught with the potential to fail at many points. Developmental and regulatory time frames are long, introducing multiple potential points of failure. The capital necessary for research and development is substantial. So on and so forth. The result is that many upstart biotech firms fail to commercialize, taking their equity down in the process. Those firms that make it through and reach commercialization are rewarded with the spoils of success. They pay shareholders handsomely with returns that can turn a small investment into a fortune. The firms discussed below still have reasonable chances of commercialization and the potential to reward investors handsomely. Even if they don’t ultimately reach success, they can still reward investors handsomely as they pass milestones in the development process. FibroGen (FGEN) FibroGen (NASDAQ: FGEN ) continues on the path toward commercialization for multiple drugs, targeting multiple diseases. The firm’s leading candidate drugs include Pamrevlumab, Roxadustat and several other oncology therapeutics. Pamrevlumab is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of a certain form of pancreatic cancer. It is also concurrently being studied in phase 2/3 clinical studies for metastatic pancreatic cancer. Roxadustat is a drug that induces the production of red blood cells and is approved in multiple countries for use in treating anemia in chronic kidney disease populations. A supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) has been submitted in China for the drug. It has been accepted for review by the China Health Authority. One of the more compelling aspects of FibroGen as an investment in financial performance. During the first quarter, revenues approached $56 million, up from $36 million a year earlier. The increased revenues allow the company to slash its net losses from $76.7 million to just below $32 million this quarter. Shares currently trade for $1.30 with a consensus target price of $5 and analyst targets ranging as high as $11. Nuvectis Pharma (NVCT) Nuvectis Pharma (NASDAQ: NVCT ) is another oncology-oriented biotech stock. It’s particularly interesting as a potential investment because while it is in the pre-revenue stages, it is also highly regarded and priced higher than one might expect. Shares currently trade for $6.21, which is quite high for a pre-revenue biotech firm. Those shares have coverage from a single analyst who expects their value to rise to $22 in the future. Investors who look at the company’s financial statements will see that it is basically treading water. NVCT has more than $19 million in liquidity and loses roughly $4 million a quarter on R&D and administrative costs. The reason for optimism surrounding Nuvectis Pharma is simple: Lead candidate drug NXP800 has been granted fast-track designation by the FDA in platinum-resistant ARID1a-mutated ovarian cancer. It’s currently in Phase 1b studies and has the potential to pass through multiple milestones moving forward that, if successful, will reward investors with strong and immediate returns. Relmada Therapeutics (RLMD) Relmada Therapeutics (NASDAQ: RLMD ) is one of many promising late-stage biotech firms developing therapeutics to address diseases of the central nervous system. Those diseases include disorders with high unmet needs including major depressive disorder (MDD), a primary focus of the firm. REL-1017 is one of the company’s lead candidate drugs. The drug is in late-stage development for the treatment of MDD. It is being studied to understand the potential of the drug as a fast-acting, once-daily antidepressant treatment. It is currently being studied in two Phase 3 double placebo-controlled studies. The company also acquired the rights to a psilocybin and derivatives program in 2021. That program has been rebranded as REL-P11 and is being studied for its efficacy in both neurogenesis and in ameliorating the effects of neurodegenerative conditions. Psilocybin and other psychoactive drugs are currently a hot area of research. Although Ralmada Therapeutics is in the pre-revenue stages and shares trade for $3.04, the sole analyst with coverage believes those shares could be worth as much as $25 in the future. Anixa Biosciences (ANIX) Anixa Biosciences (NASDAQ: ANIX ) develops treatments and vaccines to address unmet needs in ovarian cancer and breast cancer. Shares currently trade for less than $3, while the single analyst with coverage believes the stock will rise to $12 in value. The company very recently commenced treatment on the 5th patient in an ovarian cancer CAR-T clinical trial. The company is enrolling patients in its first-in-human trial who were unresponsive to at least two prior therapies. Safety was confirmed in the first three-patient cohort. The company is tripling the dose in patients four and five in order to establish dosage tolerability. The company also recently expanded its partnership with the Cleveland Clinic to develop cancer vaccines. That partnership aims to further the development of vaccines targeting rare and aggressive forms of breast and ovarian cancer. Anixa Biosciences will continue to be an interesting stock for investors, especially in light of strong positive news on multiple fronts. Genenta Science (GNTA) Let’s begin discussing Genenta Science (NASDAQ: GNTA ) stock in relation to its safety as an investment overall. Readers have noticed that multiple recommendations above have only one analyst rating. I don’t have to explain why that introduces a lot of risk overall. The thing I want to note about Genenta Science is that it has two target prices, one at $15 and the other at $25. Thus, the consensus price is $20. Genenta Science shares trade at $3.30. While the company is attractive for its raw return potential, I should also note that there are a lot of unknowns with this company. It is an Italian company and doesn’t provide a lot in the way of information. It’s a lot easier to find updates on domestic companies. The information we do have is a financial report dating from the end of 2023. It simply shows the company is not producing much in the way of revenues. The stock offers so much potential because the company is developing a stem cell platform for the safe treatment of solid tumors. It has demonstrated the potential to reprogram the cells of glioblastoma patients. Affimed (AFMD) Affimed (NASDAQ: AFMD ) continues to develop therapeutics for the treatment of lymphoma, a grouping of blood cancers that originate in the lymphatic system. The stock is interesting for a number of reasons both operational and developmental. The company reduced its workforce by 50% in 2023 in an effort to streamline operations. AFMD is redirecting its resources to three lead candidate programs following the restructuring. That leads me to my next point: The company is doing well from a developmental perspective. Each of those three candidate programs progressed in 2023. Affimed awaits further data readouts from those programs in Q2 and expects dose escalation. That implies current safety and will be used to establish the upper tolerability for those respective programs. As with any penny biotech stock, failure is a distinct possibility. However, Affimed is well regarded and benefits from a consensus target price of $32. It currently trades for just over $4. Lipocine (LPCN) Lipocine (NASDAQ: LPCN ) stock trades for $6.89 but is expected to rise to $33. Like so many other stocks on this list, Lipocine only has coverage from one analyst. That introduces risk to what is already a risky biotech stock. However, that’s the game investors must be willing to play in the risk-fueled world of pharma stock investing. As you may have guessed by the firm’s name, Lipocine does work in the obesity management space. Candidate drug Lpcn2401 is currently in Phase 2 studies and is showing promise in reducing obesity in patients with at least one co-related morbidity. However, the company is also developing treatments outside of the weight loss realm. Those programs span disease areas, including postpartum depression, cirrhosis, essential tremors and testosterone replacement therapy. What’s particularly good about the company is that it actually produced positive net income in the most recent quarter. Lipocine reported $3.5 million in net income in the first quarter, reversing a $3.9 million net loss 12 months prior. On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks : With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.

        "description": "Nothing Ear (a) vs Nothing Ear: Which one to buy in India?",
        "content": "Listen to Story Nothing recently launched two pair of new wireless earphones in India, aimed at different consumers. The Nothing Ear (a) is priced affordably, at Rs 7,999. The Nothing Ear, which is more of a higher-end version, is selling at Rs 11,999. But, the difference between both of them is not very big. The Ear (a) offers the same performance as its more expensive sibling but with a few trade-offs. And what are they? Which one would be the best choice for you? Let's find out. The Nothing Ear (a) has a unique design and its yellow colour model is very attractive. Nothing has always proved that innovative or unique design can do wonders and this stands true for its products. One of the key selling points of Nothing devices is design and the company does a great job at it. The Nothing Ear retains the same old design seen in previous generations, but maintains the semi-transparent look which still looks very appealing. The case of both earbuds is quite compact and can be fitted in small pockets as well. The earphones offer a good fit and they don't fall down from ears while running. There are no touch controls, instead Nothing has given a pinch-to-control feature that works smoothly. The earbuds are IP54 rated. The case of the Ear (a) is IPX2 rated, whereas the Ear version has an IP55 rating. All-in-all, you are getting a good design. Since both them have the same ANC and 11mm drivers, you can expect the same performance on both of them. The earbuds offer a good sound quality experience and those who are looking for a well-balanced output will likely be pleased by the latest set of Nothing earphones. They can deliver detailed audio, leaning towards warmth without overpowering bass or boosting treble. Additionally, not all wireless earphones are able to ace Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), but Nothing earphones are able to cut background noise pretty well. I had no issues with calls well, although there were times when the person on the other end of the call was getting a little muffled sound because I was in a noisy environment. There is also a dual connection feature that lets you connect the earbuds to two devices, which basically means that they can be connected to a laptop or your phone as well. In-ear detection is one of the important features and Nothing has given it. It pauses the music when you take the earphones out of the ears. The battery life of Nothing earphones is exceptional, something that I have noted in my reviews as well. The Nothing Ear (a) has a slightly smaller battery compared to the Ear version. My Ear (a) lasted for around 7-8 days with 3-4 hours of daily usage. The more expensive model managed to offer around 9 days of battery life. This is commendable because I just have to charge it once and it can easily survive for more than a week. The Ear has support for wireless charging, unlike the budget version. The Nothing Ear (a) is a great set of wireless earphones under Rs 8,000 that I would recommend you to buy right away. You are getting the same sound quality with the lower-end model and the only big trade-off is the lack of support for wireless charging that you get with the high-end Nothing Ear. The budget version features a refreshing design; the yellow colour looks very attractive with a semi-transparent look. However, the build quality of the Ear is slightly better and you get a tad longer battery life with it. So, the choice of which one could be a better pair of wireless earbuds depends on a user's requirements. Both are the best audio products in the market.",

        "description": "Pulled between political catastrophe and salvation, voters in high numbers are objectively wrong. It's a huge problem for Biden.",
        "content": "One of the worst things about democracy is the way we talk about it. For instance, politicians love to talk about unity, but our constitutional system was to set up to keep unity at bay, preferring a more adversarial approach, pitting faction and against faction. Checks and balances, separation of powers and the divided authorities between the federal and state governments are predicated on the idea that unity will be rare and temporary. The Constitution places our most cherished liberties on a high shelf, hard to reach during moments of unifying populist passion. The rhetorical mismatch doesn’t just apply to the mechanisms of democracy but also to the culture of democracy. Democratic manners demand that politicians never say the voters are wrong. But competitive elections — essential to any workable definition of democracy — require some voters to be “wrong.” I don’t necessarily mean in their policy preferences (though that’s frequently the case), I just mean elections create winners and losers. And yet, winning politicians, with barely half of the electorate on their side, routinely declare that the “America people have spoken” after every victory. More to the point, voters are often simply wrong about basic facts going into an election. For instance, the Biden campaign is struggling with an electorate that believes the economy is far worse than it is. To be clear, I didn’t say they the economy is good, though that argument can be made . No, President Biden is struggling to convince the electorate that the economy isn’t the worst ever. A recent YouGov survey asked voters to say which decade, starting in the 1930s, had the worst economy. A third (32%) said the 2020s, our current decade, is the worst, worse even than the 1930s or 1970s. Only 23% said the ’30s and a mere 5% named the ’70s as the worst. This is, by any objective measure, wrong, spectacularly wrong. Now, there’s a lot of partisan bias at work here. Only 19% of Democrats said ours is the worst decade and 24% did say the 1930s were, but 45% of Republicans believe the 2020s are the worst. Still, when nearly 1 in 5 Democrats wrongly believe things are worse than during the Great Depression, Democrats have got a problem. This is merely one facet of Biden’s “ vibes ” problem. Large numbers of Americans (42%) think the 2020s are the worst decade for crime, which is just wrong . Twenty-eight percent think the 1940s — World War II, duh — had the “most war.” Only 4% named the 1970s and 6% cited the 2000s — when America fought, respectively, the Vietnam war and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan. But 19% said the current decade had the “most war” — and we’re not at war, though events in Ukraine and Gaza do make the times seem bellicose. From scientific breakthroughs to family unhappiness to racial inequality, lots of Americans just think things have never been worse. Now, subjectively, there are perfectly valid arguments that things are not going well or that they can or should be going better. But we’re talking about objective judgments here, and objectively huge numbers of Americans are objectively wrong. And in fairness to them, I suspect many people don’t think they’re making objective judgments. When people say, “I’m having the worst day — or decade — ever!” they’re not necessarily being literal. They’re making a vibes declaration. This is obviously a huge problem for Joe Biden. Thanks in part to the ravages of inflation and high interest rates and in part to his own shortcomings, he can’t change minds about the economy. But the causality works both ways. Economic realities contribute to negative attitudes and negative attitudes shape how the economy is perceived. And on many fronts, particularly race, Biden is fueling those negative attitudes (see his commencement address at Morehouse College ). But that explanation is insufficient. Democracy depends on the promise of incremental, cumulative, progress. James Madison didn’t want polls to be the measure of the voters’ mood, but elections. Which is why we have them constantly, at every level of government. Democracy, for Madison, isn’t about unity or agreement, but about argument and disagreement, and constant self-correction. Thanks to that vision, we’ve made enormous strides. But now, both parties wallow in catastrophism and presentism. Donald Trump — who has the historical memory of a goldfish — falsely screeches that things have never been worse. Yet as cartoonish as his rhetoric is, he’s making a right-wing version of a common left-wing argument. Indeed, every four years, partisans insist that this is the “most important election ever” and that catastrophe or salvation is on the ballot. Relentlessly crying wolf has fueled the mess we’ve found ourselves in, and perhaps the mess to come. After all, when you constantly tell people we’re in an existential crisis, the vibes can create the reality, whether it’s warranted by the facts or not. @jonahdispatch",

        "content": "A new nightclub has opened its doors underneath a shopping centre in Bristol city centre. The Underground - located underneath the Galleries shopping centre - has already hosted a couple of events this month. Back in February, an application was submitted to Bristol City Council to start running late-night events at the Galleries from April . And now events have started to be held at the \"unique industrial space beneath the streets of central Bristol\", as the venue is described on Instagram . A \"Rumble in the Jungle\" night was held on May 4, followed by another event on May 5. To enter the club, party-goers have to go down the ramp under the bridge on Fairfax Street. READ MORE: Redundant cyclepath could be removed next to M49 ‘ghost junction’ One of the application to the council reads: \"Premises license, incorporating the sale of alcohol and playing of live and recorded, amplified music within private premises on selected dates from 16/04/2024 onwards. \"The premises will operate as an event space for the following licensable activities applied for: \"Sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises: 12-5am. Live music: 12-5am. \"Recorded music: 12-5am. Late night refreshment: 12-5am.\" The hours of operation were stated as 12pm-5am, and 9pm-5am, respectively. The applicants are named as Frankie Mann of The Galleries, and Bris-Tek Events of 25 Union Gallery in Broadmead. Alfresco Disco is also behind the new venue. The company - which has been running for more than 15 years - is known for running events in quarries, warehouses, boxing gyms, old magistrates' courts, woods and under railway arches. Back in February 2022 Frankie Mann, who is a DJ/Promoter and the director of Alfresco Disco, was granted permission to host a dance music party at a secret location in East Bristol , for thousands of revellers. However, this was only done so after the organisers scaled back the closing time from 4am to midnight.",

        "content": "Labour leader Keir Starmer in the recent local elections (Photo: flickr/Keir Starmer) Keir Starmer may have his eyes firmly fixed on election victory but behind him lie a trail of broken promises, crumbled pledges and hastily taken U-turns. He clawed his way to the top of the Labour Party by vowing to enact a slew of measures around taxing the rich, nationalising public services and delivering justice for ordinary people. Yet he has spent the last four years smashing through any initial attempts to challenge the Tories’ rotten rule. Starmer has consistently broken with any notion of defending workers’ rights, action on climate catastrophe and abolishing the Tories’ cruel benefits system. He has effectively taken a sledgehammer to the ten promises put forward in his 2020 election campaign, brought together under the slogan “another future is possible”. Each broken promise isn’t a momentary lapse of judgement—it is a deliberate act to set his party out as one that will rule to protect corporate and imperialist interests. For instance, in 2020, Starmer said he’d back a Green New Deal which would pour investment into environmental infrastructure and jobs. Yet last year he told the fossil fuel industry it could continue to drill into the North Sea “for decades to come”. Getting her excuses in early, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, claimed a Labour government couldn’t afford the Green New Deal now as the Tories have “crashed the economy”. This backpedalling serves to reassure nervous banks and businesses that a Labour government is a safe pair of hands for capitalism. And recently Starmer is ramping up the racist rhetoric about the importance of guarding British borders. He promised to be more effective at deporting migrants than the Tories are. One of Starmer’s six key pledges , released earlier this month, is a promise to launch a border security command to stop small boat crossings. This vicious attack is about entering into the political theatre of anti‐migrant rhetoric. Keir Starmer’s support for Israeli genocide in Gaza is his greatest crime. He infamously supported war crimes when he said “Israel does have that right” to cut off water and power to the people of Gaza. In February, fearing a revolt by dozens of his own MPs, he pressured house of commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle to prevent a vote on an amendment calling for an unconditional ceasefire. At every turn he has backed Israel and confined any criticism of Binyamin Netanyahu to the limits set by United States president Joe Biden. When the pressure from below became too great, Starmer started speaking of a ceasefire. But it was always conditional on Hamas surrendering. Starmer told a meeting last week that recognition of a Palestinian state could happen only as “part of a process” of peace talks involving Israel. Labour’s shadow Middle East minister, Wayne David, expanded on Starmer’s remarks to explain that Israel would have a veto. A two-state solution would only ever come to “fruition in a way which is acceptable to the state of Israel. That is the way to bring about peace,” he said. Backing for imperialism is central before the generals, spymasters and the ruling class will back a potential prime minister. Israel, which plays such an important role for the West in theMiddle East, is a central test. Starmer, who leads the self-proclaimed “party of Nato”, has passed the challenge set by the imperialists. One area of Starmer’s leadership where there hasn’t been backsliding is in ousting the Labour left. He has pursued the remnants of left activists and leadership around Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer wasted no time in forcing the left into humiliated submission. In October 2020, just six months into his leadership, Starmer suspended Corbyn as a Labour MP for saying that the scale of the antisemitism crisis within the party had been “dramatically overstated”. It was a hammer blow to the hundreds of thousands of new members that had joined the party during Corbyn’s premiership. Starmer has utilised every arm of the party to turn it from left toward right. For instance, the national executive council (NEC) voted in July 2021 to ban Labour members who had been part of a number of left wing groups. And the NEC repeatedly pushed back on members who have come up against the pro-business, pro-war and anti‐worker rhetoric of Starmer’s Labour. Yet despite driving the party further to the right, Starmer is proud of the changes made under his leadership. In February 2023 he crowed, “The Labour Party is unrecognisable from 2019, and it will never go back. “If you don’t like the changes that we’ve made, I say, the door is open, and you can leave.” Bringing in national service will be a joke to many Labour is no way out of the recent disgraceful governments We need a lot more of this during the election Back Corbyn, keep up fight for Palestine",

        "content": "Trips to Spain are expected to hit record highs this year despite locals staging angry anti-tourism protests as Majorcan woman who heckled Brits pleads with holidaymakers: 'If you want to help us, don't come' By Perkin Amalaraj and Natalia Penza Published: 05:47 EDT, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 06:09 EDT, 28 May 2024 e-mail 5 View comments Spain is set to welcome a record number of visitors for the second year in a row, despite a massive surge in anti-tourism protestors across the country. Travel agency Destina reported that it already has 54% more bookings for Spain this year than in 2023's summer months. Tourists from Portugal, Germany and Italy are heading to Spain in droves, with each nation seeing an increase of 70%, 48% and 36% respectively. But the agency's data shows Brits have largely eschewed Spain, with bookings from the UK specifically falling by 15%. Data from the UN's tourism agency showed the country welcomes 85million visitors, double the native population, last year. This number is 13million more than the previous year. British tourists watch the coronation of Britain's King Charles and Queen Camilla on TV screens in a pub, in Benidorm Protesters hold a banner reading 'Mallorca is not for sale' during a demonstration A demonstrator holds a sign that reads 'rebels with out a house' Read More Newly erected terrace of Majorca beach club that collapsed and killed four people last week 'was illegal and unlicensed' While tourism makes up around 13% of Spain's GDP, furious locals in travel hotspots have been protesting tourism in their regions, leaving holidaymakers feeling intimidated. An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital Palma and headed for Weyler Square on Saturday, where holidaymakers were out in force for dinner and drinks. Polly Taylor, who was dining with three friends, said that she initially had no idea what the crowd were doing until they started to come closer to the restaurant as armed police began to show up on the scene. 'It was like a storm was coming but we didn't know what the storm was about....then the noise from the protestors just got louder and louder and we were swamped with them', Taylor said. Eventually, as the small group with whistles and drums began to get louder and louder, a Majorcan who was dining nearby attempted to engage with the agitators. The group responded by blowing whistles in his face and taunting him, Taylor said. Demonstrators take part in a performance depicting a tourist and a Mallorcan in traditional costume during a demonstration to protest against the massification of tourism and housing prices Protesters hold signs reading 'For rent and I can't pay' during a demonstration to protest against the massification of tourism Read More Fury over £60-a-day charge to use sunbeds in Palma: Outcry in Majorca over huge price to use beach facilities The intimidating atmosphere continued as Taylor said the noticed signs reading: 'Go home tourists'. 'At that point, between the sea of people and..., it felt very intimidating to the point we discussed trying to leave and get out in case it turned nasty. We eventually managed to move into the restaurant to get off the street before any trouble could start'. One protestor walked through the dining area on the street while 'clapping and shouting'. The Londoner said that she asked her waiter what the protest was about but he said that he didn't know. 'Clearly he did, but he seemed embarrassed,' she added. Now, Taylor said that she won't be visiting Majorca again. 'I will take my money elsewhere until they sort this all out. I understand their cause, being priced out of their own country owing to tourism, but they were targeting the wrong people.' People take part in a protest against mass tourism and gentrification in the island ahead of summer season in Palma de Mallorca, Bilbao locals were shocked after seeing a large-handwritten anti-tourist sign over a bus-stop billboard offering cheap flights to the Balearic Islands 'They never to target their government and the huge holiday companies. We were simply contributing to their economy by holidaying for a few days,' Taylor said.

She shocked locals in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao by putting up a large-handwritten sign over a bus-stop billboard offering cheap flights to the Balearic Islands from just 19 Euros (£16) to enjoy the region's 'rhythm and waves' which read: 'The Balearic Islands are very overcrowded. 'If you want to help us don't come for the time being. We will welcome you back again if we manage to reverse this situation of unsustainable tourism.' She added referencing the price of accommodation on islands like Majorca and Ibiza which protestors against the current tourism model have linked to Airbnb-style holiday rentals: 'Flights at 19 euros, rents at 1,900 euros' before signing off her message as 'Una Mallorquina' - English for 'A Majorcan woman.' She wrote on X, formerly Twitter, where she posted the photo of her protest: 'I couldn't leave Bilbao...without complaining and thanking a city that wishes us the best in this cause.'

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Nigerian govt demands review of practice, procedure of ECOWAS court Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Nigerian govt demands review of practice, procedure of ECOWAS court Published on May 28, 2024 By Matthew Atungwu The Federal Government has called on the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS Judicial Council to institute a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to avoid conflicts with national courts. Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who made this call, said the review should make the court realize its envisioned potential as a respectable regional court. Addressing the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the ECOWAS Judicial Council in Abuja, Fagbemi said the council should also provide a credible network for the promotion of uniform rules of practice and procedure in the administration of justice in order to reduce conflict of laws in the region. According to him, the ECOWAS Judicial Council stands in a proper position to work towards the promotion of rule of law and democratic governance, which have come under intense pressure in recent times. He also added that as the ECOWAS bloc continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind. He said the challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the West African states are identical in terms of judicial autonomy, provision of funding and infrastructural facilities for the courts, among others. In the same vein, he said member states also share the challenges confronting the region in terms of economy, migration, integration, insecurity, enforcement of fundamental rights. The AGF enjoined the ECOWAS Judicial Council to utilize the regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to address the issues in order to achieve greater independence of the judiciary and a more prosperous and safer sub-region. Speaking earlier, the chairman of the ECOWAS Judicial Council and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, said the council was working towards ensuring a just and equitable society. He charged member states to work towards safeguarding the principles of justice, upholding the rule of law, and advancing the cause of peace and prosperity. On his part, the President of the Community Court of Justice, Eward Amoako Asante, restated the commitment of ECOWAS Judicial Council to upholding the principles of justice, equity and the rule of law within the ECOWAS Community.

        "content": "Esha Deol made her debut in the industry in 2002 with 'Koi Mere Dil Se Puche'. Just before her, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Ameesha Patel had also made their debut. Kareena starrerd alongside Abhishek Bachchan in 'Refugee' while Ameesha was seen in 'Kaho Naa..Pyaar Hai' alongside Hrithik Roshan . A while ago, Ameesha had said in an interview that during those times star kids were snatching away all the roles. She had said during a chat with Bollywood Hungama, \"When I entered the film industry, I only had film actors’ kids or producers’ kids enter with me, it was Kareena Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, Tushar Kapoor, Esha Deol, Fardeen Khan , you name it, you turn your head and it was a film family third generation person coming in.\" She further added that, she was an outsider and was considered a snob and a bitch on the sets because she did not gossip, she rather chose to read. Hence, the industry kids would grab all the movies. Esha Deol has now reacted to Ameesha's remark and rather, she has a contradicting story. Esha said during a chat with India Today, \"My thoughts are very different. I think we were all very busy with our own lot of what we were given. I’ve had some wonderful friendships with the girls back then, and I think no one snatched anyone’s role to my knowledge.\" She further added, \"Everyone was very friendly, all the girls, even the men very friendly, very warm, it was really nice. I think we were all doing so much work and had so much to do. It is not that any one of us was sitting without work.\" Esha was recently seen celebrating 20 years of her film 'Yuva' directed by Mani Ratnam, which saw her alongside Ajay Devgn, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Rani Mukerji and Kareena.",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Wall Street looks set for a sleepy but positive start to a shortened week after Monday's Memorial Day break, with the consumer back in focus in May updates later today. S&P500 futures were higher again ahead of Tuesday's open after the cash index eked out its fifth straight weekly gain last week - the longest such streak since early February. U.S. consumer confidence is expected to have cooled a touch this month in the Conference Board's monthly survey due later today, although the big release of the week is clearly Friday's PCE inflation gauge. Even though Federal Reserve interest rate expectations have receded to little more than one cut over the remainder of the year, broader financial conditions captured by the Chicago Fed index are at their easiest since November 2021 - four months before the Fed began its tightening campaign. This leaves the Fed with an ongoing conundrum as to whether its restrictive monetary policy has been enough to drag inflation durably back to its 2% target as economic growth keeps humming. Annual core PCE inflation is expected to have held at 2.8% in April - even if monthly price gains eased a touch to below 0.3%. Although on the hawkish side of the Fed's policymaking council, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Tuesday continued to hold out the possibility of another rate hike if necessary. And if it is not needed, Kashkari said it would take \"many more months of positive inflation data\" to give him confidence enough to ease. Another hawk, Fed board governor Michelle Bowman, even said she would have supported either waiting to start slowing the run-off in the U.S. central bank's balance sheet or a more moderate tapering process than announced earlier this month. Despite all that, and awaiting another heavy week of debt sales, Treasury yields edged lower on Tuesday. Two and five-year notes come under the hammer later in the day. Both stock and bond market volatility gauges remain subdued. Although the U.S. economic surprise index remains in negative territory, it has picked up considerably since last week's punchy May business surveys and the Atlanta Fed's real-time economic growth estimate is tracking 3.5% for the quarter. Oil prices too picked up a touch on Tuesday ahead of Sunday's online meeting of OPEC+ producers, where traders expect 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary production cuts to stay in place. Although U.S. retail gasoline prices have retreated this month, they remain up about 15% for the year to date. Taking a cue from softer Treasury yields, the dollar was down for the third session in a row. The euro nudged higher despite money markets seeing almost a 90% chance the European Central Bank will start its rate cutting cycle as soon as next week - even if more buoyant economic soundings and wage numbers of late have scaled back full-year easing expectations a touch there too. \"Barring a surprise, the first rate cut in June is a done deal, but afterwards we have several degrees of freedom,\" French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau told Monday's edition of Germany's Boersen Zeitung. Supporting the ECB's move to jump the Fed gun, surveys on Tuesday showed euro zone household inflation expectations for the next 12 months edged below 3% in April for the first time since 2021. Overseas stock markets more generally were subdued - mixed in Asia and slightly positive in Europe. Elsewhere, U.S. markets are set for a new dawn of sorts on Tuesday, when the settlement time for U.S. equities, corporate municipal bonds and other securities will be halved to one day, or T+1, following the adoption of a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule. Little disturbance was evident as overseas investors adjusted to the changes. In corporate news, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )'s shares rose 2% ahead of the open on data showing its iPhone sales in China jumped 52% in April from a year earlier as overall smartphone sales in the country increased by more than 25%. Key diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * US May consumer confidence, Dallas Fed's May manufacturing survey, March house prices; Canada April producer prices * German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron speak at Franco-German summit in Schloss Meseberg north of Berlin * Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak; European Central Bank policymaker Klaas Knot and Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann both speak * U.S. Treasury sells 2- and 5-year notes, 3- and 6-month bills (By Mike Dolan, editing by Ed Osmond, mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

It has alleged that he acted in collusion with ministers of AAP-run Delhi Government, AAP leaders and other persons to help private liquor businessmen gain illegal benefits in lieu of kickbacks. New Delhi: A special court on Tuesday reserved its order on whether to take cognisance of a supplementary charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against Delhi Chief Minister and AAM Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal in the excise policy-linked money-laundering case. ED recently filed chargesheet naming Kejriwal, AAP as an accused in money laundering case The ED recently filed a supplementary prosecution complaint (chargesheet) naming Kejriwal and his party AAP as an accused in money laundering case. Special Judge Kaveri Baweja reserved her order after hearing arguments by the ED, which said that there is sufficient evidence against the accused to put them on trial in the case. What are the allegations against Kejriwal? As per the ED, Kejriwal was the “kingpin and key conspirator” of the alleged excise policy scam. It has alleged that he acted in collusion with ministers of AAP-run Delhi Government, AAP leaders and other persons to help private liquor businessmen gain illegal benefits in lieu of kickbacks. It has further said that Kejriwal being the national convenor of AAP was vicariously responsible for the alleged excise policy scam. Kejriwal is currently out on interim bail granted by Supreme Court ED arrested Kejriwal in the money laundering case on March 21 and he is currently out on interim bail till June 1. The Supreme Court granted Kejriwal interim bail for election campaigning in the ongoing Lok Sabha elections on May 10 and directed him to surrender before the authorities on June 2. Kejriwal has moved an application before the apex court seeking a seven-day extension of his interim bail period on medical grounds. A vacation bench on Tuesday said that Kejriwal’s plea seeking extension of interim bail period be placed before the Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud for appropriate directions, as another bench of the court has heard the case and reserved its judgment on the issue. The ED recently also moved an application before the special court seeking extension of judicial custody of Kejriwal after his surrender on June 2 in the money laundering case. ED recently also filed chargesheet naming BRS leader Kavitha as an accused The ED recently also filed a supplementary prosecution complaint naming Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha and four others as an accused in an excise policy-linked money laundering case and the special court has reserved its verdict on whether to take cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet filed by the ED naming Kavitha and others. AAP leader and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is also facing money laundering and corruption charges in cases related to alleged irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-defunct Delhi Excise Policy and is currently lodged in judicial custody. AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh was also arrested in the money laundering case and he is currently out on bail.",

        "content": "Dublin, May 28, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global Biomethane Market: Analysis By Production, By Technology, By Feedstock, By End-Use, By Region Size and Trends with Impact of COVID-19 and Forecast up to 2029\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global biomethane market was valued at US$3.66 billion in 2023. The market value is expected to reach US$5.63 billion by 2029. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approx. 8% during the forecasted period of 2024-2029 as theglobal biomethane market production is expected to reach 18.07 billion cubic meters by 2029. Biomethane is being adopted by cities, corporations, industrial users, and fleet owners to decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors, move towards a circular economy, and respond to ESG concerns. European and North American energy utilities are investing heavily in biomethane to support decarbonization policies and clean energy supplies. New applications, such as the use of biomethane to produce clean hydrogen, are emerging. Hence, the combination of environmental imperatives, policy support, technological innovation, and market demand is expected to drive significant growth in the biomethane market in the forthcoming years. Europe held the major share of the market both in terms of market value and market production. European biomethane production has been further analyzed based on feedstock (Agriculture Residues, Energy Crops, Organic Waste, and Others), end-use (Building, Transport, Power, Industry, and Others), and regions (Germany, France, UK, Denmark, and Rest of Europe). Currently, the EU produces enough biomethane to satisfy approximately 2% of its total natural gas consumption. However, the REPowerEU plan aims to increase this share to 20% by 2030, necessitating a substantial increase in production to over 350 TWh annually. Capacity expansion efforts are already underway, with Europe boasting 1,322 biomethane-producing facilities as of April 2023. Countries like Denmark, Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, and Italy are leading the charge in biomethane production, driven by supportive government initiatives and ambitious renewable energy targets. The expansion of the US biomethane sector is supported by legislative measures such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides fiscal support to biogas for all end-uses and extends credits for alternative fuels in transportation. Additionally, demand for biomethane from non-transportation sectors is expected to drive significant growth, with natural gas utilities and large natural gas users purchasing RNG to decarbonize their supplies and comply with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments. The US's biomethane market production has been further analyzed based on feedstock (Municipal Solid Waste, Agriculture Waste, Food Waste & Waste Water) and end-use (Transport Fuel and Power Generation). China is the major producer of biomethane in the Asia-Pacific region and has the potential to grow further in the coming years. China has adopted its 14th Five-Year-Plan (FYP) on renewable energy, which includes high targets for renewables, including RNG, given its dual carbon strategic goals. Combined with the rural revitalization strategy and the strong focus of China's policy on energy security, the still undeveloped RNG sector is expected to register an accelerated development during the 14th FYP period (2021-2025). The growth would be facilitated by improvement in policy support, better grid access to the network, and the participation of big players in the sector. The Indian biomethane market production has also been analyzed based on the following feedstocks (Agricultural Waste, Pressmud, Municipal Solid Waste, Animal Waste, and Others). Market Segmentation Analysis: By Technology: The anaerobic digestion segment held the highest share of the market, whereas thermal gasification is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. Anaerobic digestion (AD) has historically dominated the biomethane market due to its maturity, scalability, and compatibility with a wide range of organic feedstocks. As technological advancements continue to improve process efficiency, enhance gas yields, and reduce operational costs, the use of anaerobic digestion for biomethane production is poised for continued growth in the forthcoming years. On the other hand, thermal gasification technology has emerged as a promising approach for converting biomass and organic waste into biomethane and other valuable products such as syngas and biochar. Unlike anaerobic digestion, which relies on microbial decomposition, thermal gasification utilizes high temperatures and controlled oxygen levels to convert organic materials into a synthesis gas composed of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane. While thermal gasification with biomethane synthesis is still in the pre-commercial phase, there is significant potential to scale up this technology in the mid to long term. By Feedstock: Municipal solid waste held the highest share of the market, whereas the agriculture segment is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. The utilization of municipal solid waste (MSW) as a feedstock for biomethane production has been on the rise as the increasing global population and urbanization have led to a corresponding surge in waste generation, creating a significant abundance of organic materials suitable for biomethane production. Moreover, landfill diversion policies and regulations aimed at reducing methane emissions from waste decomposition have incentivized the adoption of waste-to-energy technologies such as anaerobic digestion for MSW treatment. On the other hand, as sustainable agriculture practices gain momentum, and policies incentivize renewable energy production from agricultural sources, the utilization of agricultural feedstock for biomethane is poised for significant growth in the forthcoming years. By End-Use: Transport fuel held the highest share of the market and is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. In the transportation sector, biomethane can be utilized as a direct substitute for compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) in vehicles. Its use helps to significantly lower carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants compared to conventional gasoline or diesel. In the past few years, the European transportation sector has also seen a strong increase in demand for biomethane supported by the numerous bio-LNG plants in operation and under construction. To continue this momentum and achieve rapid decarbonization policymakers in Europe would need to adopt a neutral-technology approach. Competitive Landscape: The global biomethane industry is fragmented.In the competitive landscape of the biomethane market, players are adopting various strategies to expand their market share and gain a competitive edge. For instance, on April 25, 2024, TotalEnergies and Vanguard Renewables signed an agreement to create an equally owned joint venture to develop, build and operate Farm Powered renewable natural gas (RNG) projects in the US. TotalEnergies and Vanguard Renewables would advance 10 RNG projects into construction over the next 12 months, with a total annual RNG capacity of 0.8 TWh (2.5 Bcf). On the other hand, on April 25, 2024, Brimex Energy, a joint venture between Mexico-based Grupo Serrano and England-based Farmergy, obtained the first permit in Mexico for the production of biomethane. The permit authorizes the production and storage of biomethane.

        "content": "Tragic father's only moments with his daughter: Man, 23, left in a three-month coma after being attacked on a night out lays next to his baby in heartbreaking snap taken just days before his life support machine was switched off By Freya Barnes Published: 05:55 EDT, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 06:16 EDT, 28 May 2024 e-mail This is the heartbreaking moment a comatose father lays next to the newborn daughter he never got to see - just days before his life support machine was switched off. George Fenlon, 23, was left unconscious in hospital for three months after being attacked on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire, last year. His partner Beth Turner, 23, was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died. While he never regained consciousness, he was able to lay with his daughter in hospital as she was placed in the crook of his arm, with George's devastated mother Melissa capturing the touching moment. Melissa, 53, said: 'Looking back now, I'm not sure how we all got through it, the range of emotions we had to go through was horrendous. 'Beth wanted Clara to meet George and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and she had a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she saw him everyday. George Fenlon, 23, meeting his baby daughter Clara Georgia just days before his life support was switched off George's partner Beth Turner, 23, wanted Clara to meet her father and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and spent a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she could see him everyday 'It was important that she did that because we've got memories, we've got pictures. 'The hospital did a lot, we've also got little prints of Clara's and George's hands together.' Police were called at around 2am on August 15 last year to a report of an assault at The Strand in Blackpool. They found George, a bartender at Revolution Bar, had suffered serious head injuries. He was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital and put on a life support machine but tragically died in hospital on November 22. An inquest opening heard George collapsed and lost consciousness after the attack. A post-mortem found his cause of death was complications of blunt head trauma. George died three months after being attacked on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire Beth was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died Rhys Jones, 26, of Cannock, Staffordshire, has been charged with murder and will stand trial in June. Melissa said of the ordeal: 'We were all in shock, we weren't sure what was happening. 'It was one of his friends who phoned, he said something had happened but no one was sure what. 'Then we heard George had gone to Royal Preston Hospital and we didn't know why but when we got more information, we found out he had a serious head injury so Preston was the best place for him. 'His girlfriend was six or seven months pregnant at that time so we were all just in shock and when we saw him it was pretty horrific.' Six months after his death, Melissa is now hoping to create a lasting legacy for her 'fun-loving' son. While George never regained consciousness, his daughter will at least have pictures with him George as a young boy with his mother Melissa who said she doesn't know how they got through what happened to her son George and his mother Melissa smiling together on the day of her graduation She has organised a fundraising event in July called 'The Fenlon Football Funday' in Stanley Park in the resort, featuring a football tournament and kids entertainment. Melissa said of George: 'He just wanted to make people laugh, he was a fun loving guy and very easy going, nothing really fazed him to be honest. 'Clara's favourite TV show is Teletubbies and he was like a big Teletubby I suppose, just daft and it's sad that Clara will never experience that. 'So the fun day is for Clara and all of George's friends, to keep his memory alive. 'George was just so popular that it'll be nice for the youngsters of Blackpool not to be sad, but instead remember George through Clara. 'If it's a success this year, I'm hoping it will be an annual event. It's just what George was, he was a fun loving guy who loved his football, so it's what George would have wanted - for everyone to have a nice day.' Revolution Bar, where George worked, are continuing the celebrations in the evening and will be creating a cocktail in his name. All proceeds will go towards Elliot's place, a local charity dedicated to supporting young men with their mental health and well being. Melissa added: 'George's friends have been struggling with his loss so the charity just spoke to me, it made sense.'

        "content": "Melons are undeniably one of the most loved summer fruits that are extensively consumed during this season for their cooling and hydrating properties. Loaded with the goodness of vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and fiber, melons make for a perfect summer delight. But do you know pairing melon with certain foods can trigger sudden allergic and metabolic reactions. Well, here are some foods that you must avoid eating with melons at all cost. Melons are packed with essential nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and water, which makes them an ideal summer fruit. Their high water content in melons keep the body hydrated in hot weather, while the vitamins and minerals support overall health and immune function. Melons are low in calories and fat, making them a refreshing and guilt-free snack option during the summer season. Curd: Melons are rich in water content and can dilute stomach acid, potentially interfering with the digestion of curd, which requires acidic conditions for proper digestion. Milk: Similar to yogurt, consuming milk with melons may lead to digestive issues due to the difference in digestion times and acidity levels. Cucumbers: While both melons and cucumbers belong to the same family (Cucurbitaceae), combining them may lead to bloating or gas for some individuals due to similar enzymes and compounds they contain. Bananas: Bananas and melons have different digestion rates, which can cause discomfort or digestive issues when consumed together. High-Protein Foods: Consuming melons with high-protein foods like meat or eggs may lead to digestive discomfort or bloating due to differences in digestion times and enzyme requirements. Acidic Fruits: Avoid combining melons with highly acidic fruits like oranges, lemons, or grapefruits, as this may cause digestive upset or acid reflux in some individuals. Carbonated Drinks: Carbonated beverages can cause bloating and discomfort when combined with melons due to the gas they produce in the stomach. Alcohol: Drinking alcohol with melons can impair digestion and may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort or acid reflux. Spicy Foods: Spicy foods can irritate the stomach lining and may exacerbate digestive issues when consumed with melons, especially for individuals with sensitive stomachs. High-Fat Foods: Avoid combining melons with high-fat foods like fried foods or heavy sauces, as this may slow down digestion and lead to discomfort or bloating.",

        "content": "Hong Kong police arrested six people on Tuesday under the city’s new security law for “posting messages with seditious intention” online. Five women and one man aged between 37 and 65 were arrested Tuesday, said the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force in a statement. One of the women arrested was already on remand at the Tai Lam Centre, a maximum-security women’s prison, the police said. Police investigations revealed that the woman on remand, through the five others, “had been posting messages with seditious intention on an anonymous social media page since April 2024, taking advantage of an upcoming sensitive day,” the statement said. This was done “with the aim to incite hatred towards the Central Government (Beijing), the HKSAR Government and the Judiciary, as well as inciting netizens to organise or take part in unlawful activities at a later stage.” The six people were “suspected of violating section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, which reads ‘Offences in connection with seditious intent’,” the statement said, referring to Hong Kong’s newly enacted law. It would be the first such arrests under the law, commonly referred to as Article 23. Enacted in March, Article 23 includes penalties of up to life imprisonment for five categories of crime including treason, insurrection, espionage, sabotage and external interference. It also expanded the British colonial-era offence of “sedition” to include inciting hatred against China’s Communist Party leadership. The legislation is the city’s second national security law — the first was imposed by Beijing in 2020 after huge, sometimes violent democracy protests were dispelled. Tuesday’s arrests come a week before June 4, the 35th anniversary of when Beijing sent troops into Tiananmen Square to quash appeals for democracy. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "New rules covering debt registration in the Netherlands do not go far enough and thousands of people remain on the official list of debtors, even though they have paid off all they owe, the Dutch privacy watchdog Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens said on Tuesday. The credit registry Bureau Krediet Registratie currently maintains a note next to the names of people who have cleared their debts for five years, and this makes it difficult for them to apply for a new loan or a mortgage, the AP said. “This has led to idiotic situations,” said AP board member Katja Mur. “Perhaps a debt collection agency was brought in because you were late in paying for a Playstation years ago, and now you can’t get a mortgage. This is out of all proportion.” The new rules will reduce the five year notification period to three, but that does not go far enough, Mur said. “The BKR should have nothing on you if you have paid your debts,” she said. “If you have cleared your debts, why should you remain in the register?” Some 10 million names are included in the BKR register, which includes people who have been in the red with their bank and been behind with loan repayments, as well as the size and duration of all loans. A legal industry has sprung up to help people remove their names from the register. “Our experience is that they always say no,” Deepak Thakoerdien from legal advice bureau Dynamiet Nederland told broadcaster NOS. “They only start moving when we threaten them with legal action.” The AP is also concerned that subscriptions to streaming services such as Neflix may also be included in the register, pointing out that the new regulations do not exclude this from happening. Two years ago the BKR said it wanted to include all mortgages in its registers, not just those in arrears. It also wants to add in student debts. The register currently lists arrears of at least three months with banks and mortgage providers, defacto loans for mobile phones and debts with other official credit agencies.",

        "description": "The immigration minister has been under fire over a directive he issued last year that has been linked to several tribunal decisions allowing visa holders to stay despite committing serious crimes.",
        "content": "Home Affairs head Stephanie Foster has admitted her department failed to warn Immigration Minister Andrew Giles about a slew of legal challenges that saw a tribunal allow visa holders to stay in Australia despite committing serious crimes and free a detainee who allegedly went on to commit murder. The departmental secretary made the sensational admission before a parliamentary committee hours after the embattled minister revealed he was reviewing the controversial tribunal decisions and said he had called on his department to explain why he was kept in the dark about the legal challenges. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles faced a barrage of questions over a ministerial direction. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “It is correct that he wasn’t informed,” Foster told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday evening. “We had agreed to a protocol with Minister Giles to bring to his attention cases of a particular nature ... and we did not adequately resource that function, and it was not being done in a timely way, and it has not advised Minister Giles of [those particular cases].” When Coalition senator James Paterson put to her that it was “extraordinary” the department failed to warn Giles, Foster agreed: “It is, senator, and I regret very much that this has happened.” She said she became aware of the issue in the past few days following media coverage, blaming limited resources for the oversight. Foster said the failure was ultimately hers, adding the department was now throwing resources at the issue. Giles has been under fire from the Coalition over a ministerial direction he issued in January last year that has been linked to several decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal preventing foreign criminals with longstanding connections to Australia from being deported. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton asked Giles in parliamentary question time on Tuesday about the case of a New Zealand citizen who was allowed to stay in Australia despite raping his stepdaughter. Government lawyers had unsuccessfully argued for the man’s visa to be revoked. Giles told parliament he had cancelled the man’s visa and it had remained cancelled by Home Affairs until the tribunal overruled his decision. “Now, I believe it is a decision that should still be cancelled, and I advise the House also that I have prioritised a number of cases for urgent cancellation consideration,” Giles said. The government has been under constant attack since November over its handling of the fallout from the High Court’s landmark ruling outlawing indefinite immigration detention. This masthead revealed on Tuesday that almost one in five released detainees had been charged with fresh crimes since the court decision, which prompted questions about when the government would use as-yet-untested preventative detention laws to lock up those at high risk of offending again. The Greens and asylum seeker legal advocates have also accused the government of limiting supports to those sent into the community. Compounding Labor’s immigration woes, Giles faced a barrage of questions in parliament over the tribunal’s interpretation of ministerial direction 99, which says significant weight must be given to a person’s ties to Australia. The ministerial direction was issued on January 23, 2023 to assuage the New Zealand government’s concerns that its citizens were being deported in large numbers even when they had stronger ties to Australia than to New Zealand. Last week, it emerged that the tribunal had in April released former immigration detainee Emmanuel Saki, who was charged with murder the following month. The tribunal reinstated Saki’s visa on March 27, partly due to direction 99. Questioning Foster over the bureaucratic failure, Paterson said, “someone has allegedly been murdered as a result of someone being released following a successful AAT appeal”, adding that normally would have triggered the minister’s intention to re-cancel the visa. Giles told question time he had since re-cancelled Saki’s visa, “and as the matter is before the courts, I will say nothing more”. Giles has also issued a “please explain” to his department, and told parliament a number of cases before the tribunal were not raised with him. “I’ve asked the department for an explanation,” he said. “My department is now looking at all these cases as a priority, and they are all under cancellation consideration. “Direction 99 did not, and does not, decrease the importance placed on expectations such as the ... protection of the community from crime. “This, Speaker, remains unchanged under this government. Community safety remains the highest priority of this government, and I say again, these were decisions made by an independent tribunal.” Home Affairs’ latest visa cancellation statistics show that, as of December 31, there was a significant reduction of visa cancellations on character grounds – particularly for New Zealanders – in the first six months of 2023-24. From 2019-20, when the Coalition deported 939 people on character grounds, numbers have plummeted by roughly 75 per cent post-pandemic, to 244 so far in the 2023-24 financial year. But a department spokesperson said the majority of cancellations were not subject to that ministerial direction. Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan has vowed to scrap direction 99 if the Coalition is returned to government. “When will Andrew Giles stand up and be accountable for his actions? How many visas is he looking at? When will he cancel them? Will he look at all relevant cases since January 23, 2023? Will he rescind ministerial direction 99? If not, why not?” Tehan said in parliament on Tuesday. Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

        "content": "So, what’s the deal with the Roblox Classic Daemonshank ? Originally thought to be a boss drop, this back accessory costs more than an arm and a leg. To enjoy Roblox Classic for a few more hours, head over to the official Roblox website . Need to get some last-minute badge grinding in? Look at our Roblox Classic Clip It walkthrough, our Roblox Classic Thirst Quenchers guide, and our Roblox Classic Bloxxer Secret guide. Roblox Classic Daemonshank Also known as the ‘Glitch Sword’, the Daemonshank is a special sword that’s only available for a limited time. Because of this, it’s deemed as a ‘flex’ to own and wield. However, at what cost? Well, it’s funny you should say that, because it’s quite a big cost. It doesn’t provide anything other than a cosmetic purpose, making it quite redundant. Apart from looking somewhat cool, the Daemonshank weapon, or ‘Glitch Sword’, sets you back 39,999 Robux. In real money terms, that’s a whopping $400 or thereabouts. Prior to the item dropping in the marketplace, players thought that the Glitch Sword/Daemonshank was going to be a boss drop... oh how they were wrong. It would actually be better if it were a boss drop, at least more players would be able to obtain it then. What’s the point, I hear you ask? I agree. This is probably one of the worst examples I’ve seen of a ludicrously expensive item being made available in the Roblox marketplace. I assume it won’t be available once the Classic event ends, so I do wonder how many players will end up buying it between now and then. The Daemonshank is based on the Venomshank accessory, which first came out in 2011, and was limited to 100. I do need to mention a disclaimer: it’s not worth it. The only people who can afford to waste their money on the Daemonshank are content creators. It’s literally just an accessory for your avatar...",
