        "description": "The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found.The post PNG landslide death toll expected to be over 670 appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia – The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found. Serhan Aktoprak, Chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in the South Pacific island nation, said the revised death toll was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by Friday’s landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. “They are estimating that more than 670 people (are) under the soil at the moment,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. Local officials had initially put the death toll on Friday at 100 or more. Only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered by Sunday. Around 250 additional houses have been condemned since the landslide because of still-shifting ground, leaving an estimated 1,250 people homeless, officials said. Crews have given up hope of finding survivors under earth and rubble 6 to 8 metres deep. “People are coming to terms with this so there is a serious level of grieving and mourning,” Aktoprak said. He said the new estimated death toll was “not solid” because it was based on the average size of the region’s families per household. He would not speculate on the possibility that the actual toll could be higher. Relief crews were moving survivors to safer ground on Sunday as tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is rife in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, threatened the rescue effort. Convoys that have transported food, water, and other essential supplies since Saturday to the devastated village 60 kilometres from the provincial capital, Wabag, have faced risks related to tribal fighting in Tambitanis village, about halfway along the route. Papua New Guinea soldiers were providing security for the convoys. Eight locals were killed in a clash between two rival clans on Saturday in a longstanding dispute unrelated to the landslide. Around 30 homes and five retail businesses were burned down in the fighting, local officials said. Aktoprak said he did not expect tribal combatants would target the convoys but noted that opportunistic criminals might take advantage of the mayhem to do so. “This could basically end up in carjacking or robbery,” Aktoprak said. “There is not only concern for the safety and security of the personnel, but also the goods because they may use this chaos as a means to steal.” Australia, a near neighbour and Papua New Guinea’s most generous provider of foreign aid, along with the United States are among governments that have publicly stated their readiness to do more to help responders. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.",

        "description": "\"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. But that season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988. Before his pro career, Walton was a two-time champion at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for legendary coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his unique commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

        "content": "MEXICO CITY – Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality. Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and opposition hopeful Xochitl Galvez, both 61, have dominated the presidential race in the world’s most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people. The only man running, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is trailing far behind with just days left before the vote. “It’s a huge change,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States. “A woman president will be an inspiration for women in every single sector of the economy, politics, society, and culture,” she told AFP. Sheinbaum owes much of her popularity to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a close ally who has an approval rating of more than 60% but is only allowed to serve one term. A former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus. Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots who represents a broad coalition of opposition parties, has 33%. Maynez, 38, of the small Citizens’ Movement party, has just 12%. Mexico’s next president will face an array of challenges, including managing migration, delicate relations with the neighbouring US, and criminal violence that has left more than 450,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing since 2006. Around 30 candidates for local office have been murdered in a wave of electoral violence since last September, in a country where politics, corruption, and crime are closely intertwined. Whoever wins, it will likely be business as usual for the cartels that control swaths of the country and smuggle vast amounts of cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs into the US, experts predict. “They’re not going to change their attitude just because Mexico has a female president,” Correa-Cabrera said. Another major challenge will be Mexico’s complex relationship with the US, particularly if former president Donald Trump is reelected in November, Shifter said. “If he returns to the White House, Trump is expected to double down on his hardline stance on immigration, trade, and drugs – very sensitive issues crucial to the bilateral relationship,” he said. As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors, and myriad local officials. In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested, with nearly 100 million people registered to vote.",

        "content": "Furiosa is currently the talk of the box office- for better or for worse- but fans hoping for an alternate cut akin to Fury Road’s Black and Chrome release have reason to get excited. franchise creator George Miller sat down for a chat with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast to discuss the release of , as well as the past and future of the franchise. During the chat, Miller surprised Horowitz by confirming that an alternate cut of Furiosa was already completed. “We’ve done it already,” Miller revealed. “It’s the last thing I did on this film. I call it tinted black and chrome.” The potential for a black-and-white cut of Furiosa is undoubtedly exciting news for fans of the saga. Mad Max: Fury Road received a critically acclaimed black-and-white cut called Mad Max: Fury Road—The Black and Chrome Edition. Black & Chrome was arguably received better than the original, with many saying the film’s bombastic visuals work even better in stark black-and-white. This makes the second black-and-white cut of a film Miller has done, though the Australian filmmaker isn’t quite sure himself why he’s so fascinated with the desaturated art style. “I’m still trying to demystify why the black and white, for me, has something more elemental to it.” Miller tells Horowitz. “I still can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s not because they look like old black-and-white movies. If we took a picture of ourselves right now, it might be a little more dramatic if it was black and white.” Miller doesn’t offer an update on when or if Furiosa’s alternate cut will be released, but it may not be long. Fury Road’s Black & Chrome cut was released in 2016, a year after the original theatrical run. Given the success of Fury Road’s re-release, Furiosa’s may get a quicker release. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is currently in theaters, but it’s not all positive news. The film has had a shockingly soft opening weekend, charting the in three decades.

        "content": "....Protesters Notify Party Leaders Of Abure’s Suspension Anti-Julius Abure protesters, who were at Labour Party’s headquarters in Abuja to notifying the party leadership of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party, were on Monday attacked. The attack against the protesters were carried out by an angry mob suspected to be thugs loyal to the National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), Abure. The protesters, it was gathered were Labour Party supporters from the Edo State chapter, who were at the party secretariat to demand Abure’s removal. Commotion broke out when the anti- Abure protesters stormed the party headquarters in several vehicles holding placards and chanting solidarity songs. As soon as the protesters stepped out of the vehicles, the suspected thugs loyal to Abure swooped on the vehicles with sticks and other objects forcing the drivers to zoom off. A detachment of armed policemen and operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS), however, intervened when the thugs started throwing stones into the nearby Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, in pursuit of reporters who were convering the fracas. The intervention of the security officials prevented the situation from further degenerating. A police vehicle is currently stationed in between the warring factions. Earlier, leaders of the group of protesters, distributed copies of a letter written to the National Executive Committee (NEC), of the Labour Party by the Edo State Chairman, Com. Ogbaloi K.S.E State Chairman and Secretary, Com. Akhere Frederick, notifying the national body of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party.

        "description": "Google has introduced a new 'Account deletion available' badge on the Play Store as part of a policy requiring developers to offer account deletion options. This badge is already visible in some app listings, allowing users to request account and data deletion.",
        "content": "Google has started adding a new “Account deletion available” to some apps on the Play Store. Last year, Google introduced a new Play Store policy where developers of any app that allows users to create an account also need to provide the option to delete it (both in-app and online). The company announced that these data deletion practices would appear in Play Store listings early this year. According to a report by Android Authority, this new badge has already started showing the Data Safety section of some app listings for a few testers. Apps that will include this new badge will allow users to submit a request to the developer to delete the account and the data associated with the same. Google has been asking developers to include information about app account deletion in their Play Store listings since December 2023. The company has also announced that developers need to comply with the new policy by May 31 or face penalties like app removal. The company’s data deletion policy mandates that developers offer data and account deletion options both within their apps and online. This will ensure that users don’t have to reinstall an app to delete their data or account. Developers also need to disclose if they need to retain certain data for legitimate reasons, such as regulatory compliance. As the enforcement deadline approaches and data deletion badges start showing for some apps, developers should not expect any further extensions. Meanwhile, for the first time in over eight years, Google has increased the maximum price of an app in the Play Store. Announced at Google I/O 2024, developers can now price their apps up to $999.99. However, it is unlikely that many apps will reach this new price ceiling.",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 18:53, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:16, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A young Manchester United fan got the surprise of his life, when he came face-to-face with his favourite player's family at Saturday's FA Cup Final. The Red Devils put a disappointing season behind them at Wembley by impressively dispatching of Premier League champions and rivals Manchester City and winning the FA Cup. First half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were enough to see United lift their thirteenth FA Cup and secure European football for next season. Yet, United's victory may not have been the best part of one young fan's FA Cup Final day, after a heartwarming meeting with the match winner's family on the Wembley escalator. In a video shared on social media, it shows the fan wearing the shirt of Mainoo, only to be standing in front of both the Man United midfielder's father and brother. Dad and son are shocked to learn that they are standing with Kobbie Mainoo's family The little fan proceeds to stop eating his crisps to shake the hand of Mainoo's father The Man United midfielder was the club's FA Cup match winner in their 2-1 win over Man City The moment occurred as father and son were travelling down one of Wembley's escalators, and the boy was asked if the player on the back of his shirt was his favourite player. Once the child turns round, the voice behind the camera reveals that Mainoo is his son, much to the total amazement of the father and his son. They are the introduced to the England star's big brother, who can be heard laughing at the response after revealing they are Mainoo's family. The interaction immediately sees the dad ask his lad to 'say hello', at which point he stops eating his crisps, wipes his hands on his jeans and shakes the hand of Mainoo's father. Mainoo rounded off a well-worked Man United mood to put United on their way to victory i It would have been a proud day for Mainoo's father and brother, as they witnessed a sublime performance from the teenage sensation. The midfielder was on hand to finish off a sweeping United move in the first half, putting the finishing touch to Bruno Fernandes' no-look pass to put the Red Devils 2-0 up. The goal proved to be the difference after Jeremy Doku's last consolation, and Mainoo was rewarded by being named man of the match.

        "content": "Shocking moment Leeds United fans brawl with Southampton supporters after their team's 1-0 loss at Wembley in the Championship play-off final By Arthur Parashar Published: 13:53 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:28 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments This is the shocking moment Leeds United and Southampton fans clashed in ugly scenes at Wembley Stadium after the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Just moments after Southampton secured their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory, a mass brawl broke out between the two sets of fans as they spilled out on to Wembley Way. The riled up supporters were filmed fighting as they exited the iconic stadium and walked towards Wembley Park Tube Station at about 7pm. It was clear tensions were running high in the aftermath of what is regarded as football's most lucrative fixture. Adam Armstrong's strike secured a tense victory for Southampton and crucially earned them an unparalleled £180million payday. In the video, a pair of fans are seen coming to blows as others watch on in shock. One of the men tries to throw a punch but does not make a connection as the rival fan ducks out of the way. The video starts with one fan trying to land a massive punch on a rival but the supporter is able to evade contact In ugly scenes, a football fan was kicked to the floor and left cowering as supporters closed in on him The fan in white was seen trying to calm things down but another tussle broke out beside him The pair then run towards another tussle which has broken out beside them. This time, another fan is dragged to the ground and struck while trapped on the floor. Another group of lads then come over to intervene by dragging the attacker away and punching him in the stomach. Other witnesses - including women - attempted to stop the brawls between the fans seen wearing club colours. One said: 'Stop, stop, stop. Don't do it.' But moments later, another fan strolls up to a rival supporter and punches him in the back of the head. He then sets his sights on another fan and kicks them to the ground. As he is falling to the ground, a second attacker kicks him again, leaving him sprawled out on the floor covering his head for protection. The man filming the 39-second video said: 'This is Wembley for you man? 'F***ing hell mate.' Southampton's Adam Armstrong (right) celebrates after scoring the all-important goal at Wembley Southampton fans, some with their tops off, go wild at Wembley after the Saints were promoted to the Premier League Southampton's captain Jack Stephens holds the trophy aloft after the play-off final on Sunday One onlooker shouts: 'Grow up.' The mood between the two sets of fans could not have been more different after the game. Southampton fans were celebrating after returning to the Premier League following their relegation from the top flight last season. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a Southampton fan, congratulated the Saints after they secured promotion. Following the victory, Mr Sunak wrote on X: 'We're back' before adding three 'clapping hands' emojis. Leeds United will now remain in the Championship next season after narrowly missing out on a lucrative promotion. The ugly brawl came just 24 hours after Manchester United and Manchester City fans clashed in the streets of London ahead of the FA Cup final on Saturday. Rival Manchester United and Manchester City fans brawled in the street in Harrow, London ahead of Saturday afternoon's FA Cup final at Wembley One shirtless supporter was left sprawled out in the road after fighting with a rival fan Dozens of fans piled in, with kicks and punches thrown and bottles smashed on the road The scrap spilled over the road at a bus stop in Harrow ahead of the Wembley showpiece Video footage posted on X showed a group clashing near a bus stop in Station Road, Harrow in the lead-up to the Wembley match, which United went on to triumph in 2-1. One shirtless fan was seen grappling on the floor at a bus stop with traffic at a standstill before more men pile in. Kicks and punches were thrown - and bottles thrown - during the shocking scenes in the hours ahead of the eagerly-anticipated final. Chants of 'United, United' can be heard in the background during the scrap which continued right across the road as horrified shoppers watched on. The Met Police has been approached for comment.

The seven-time Super Bowl winner played the role of doting dad Monday as he took his two youngest children, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11, for a spin out on the water. The former quarterback, 46, shared a video on Instagram of the trio's activities as they made a splash, while Post Malone and Morgan Wallen 's summer hit, 'I had some help,' plays in the background. A shirtless Brady could be seen driving a speedboat at the start of the clip before he later donned a life vest to test his watersport skills.

'You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!,' Brady captioned the post. The New England Patriots legend also shares an older son, Jack, 16, with ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, 53, but the budding high school football player didn't appear to be in the clip. The Memorial Day bonding session comes two weeks after Brady admitted that he had some regrets over participating in his Netflix roast. Brady was roasted by a number of high-profile figures - including stand-up comedians, celebrities and ex-teammates - in a live Netflix show earlier this month. A lot of the ruthless material contained jokes about his divorce from Bundchen after 13 years of marriage, which he has admitted didn't go down too well back at home. He revealed that some of the quips 'affected' his kids during an episode of 'The Pivot' with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder. 'I loved when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,' he said. 'I didn't like the way they affected my kids.

'It makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you're naïve.' The former quarterback's children weren't the only ones upset with the roast with Bundchen said to be furious about being the source of the relentless taunting. According to People , B undchen was left fuming at the jokes about her and Brady's former marriage during the special, saying she 'was deeply disappointed by the disrespectful portrayal of her family on Sunday evening's roast show'. 'As always, [Bundchen's] priority is to support her children who were affected by the irresponsible content that was broadcasted,' the insider went on.

Brady and Bundchen divorced on October 28, 2022, after 13 years of marriage. Meanwhile, Moynahan shared several cryptic social media messages after Brady was roasted for infamously dumping her while she was pregnant with Jack.

        "description": "The Big Bang Theory left fans with a sour taste on how Penny’s storyline ended compared to her overall character growht in the sitcom.",
        "content": "It’s been several years since the finale of The Big Bang Theory, but fans still can’t get over how the series decided to end Penny’s storyline compared to the series. Throughout the sitcom, , free-spirited, and knew what she wanted. It was no surprise that she fell in love with Leonard and their relationship continued up until the final season. But the finale flipped the script with Penny’s overall stance on not having kids. In “The Procreation Calculation,” Penny tells Leonard she has no desire to have kids, which upsets . She also doesn’t have a problem with him being a sperm donor for Zack. But as the finale approaches, her mindset changes, and she ends up pregnant. Yet, after all of these years, fans still don’t take to this storyline very well. On Reddit, a fan on how the sitcom built up Penny’s strong stance on not having kids, only to chuck it away in the finale. “Anyone else find it odd that they spent a good amount of time establishing Penny simply didn’t want to have children, and then in the finale, she becomes pregnant and all we get for her motivation is Leonard saying ‘yeh well now she does’ – kind of a missed opportunity there to even explore penny’s decision making,” they explained. “Seems weird they did devote a lot of time to Penny not wanting children to then just have Leonard speak for her. Literally, she says nothing about why she decided on having a child.” Another fan was angered by the fact that Penny’s pregnancy storyline wasn’t the first instance in The Big Bang Theory. Bernadette also didn’t want kids but then changed her mind. The same thing happened to Penny. It wasn’t only fans who felt the use of the storyline wasn’t well done. Kaley Cuoco, the actress who played the character, once expressed that . A fan on Reddit explained that the sitcom creators did recognize the rushed storyline. Related: “The writers acknowledge this in the tell-all book. Ultimately what happened was they were trying to fulfill Leonard’s line from episode 1 about them having beautiful and smart babies. But they acknowledged they rushed it and her being pregnant was an ‘unearned’ moment in the show,” they chimed in. In the finale, Sheldon is giving his Nobel Peace Prize speech. He recounts how Leonard said he and Penny would have beautiful and smart children the first day they met. Sheldon’s change of heart causes Penny to shed a tear.

        "content": "AMBALA: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) Ambala seat candidate Advocate Gurpreet Singh violated the secrecy of the election process by posting a video while voting at EVM compartment on his Facebook. Haryana voted on May 25 in the sixth phase of 18th Lok Sabha elections . The video was posted on Election Day on May 25 at 15:31 pm. The video was posted from a Facebook account named Advocate Sardar Gurpreet Singh Sahota, with display photo of INLD Ambala candidate. In his video post, Gurpreet Singh wrote, “ .” (Ambala is going to make history! With their son Gupreet) It is seen in the video of 17 seconds that a person approaches EVM machine keeping the mobile camera on video recording mode and records the video while vote is being polled to INLD candidate Gupreet Singh at second number on the list on machine. The person who recorded the video shows pressing the EVM button to cast vote in front of Gurpreet Singh’s photo, INLD election symbol spectacles and the display of the same on the VVPAT machine. As per the time of the posting the video, Gurpreet Singh committed the violation of the fair and transparent elections, while the election process was ongoing (7 am to 6 pm). However, during the round of several polling booths in Ambala, it was observed that the district police administration had made tight security arrangements and the voters were asked to deposit their phones at the entrance. However, in the case of an INLD candidate, it seems, a voter managed to enter the polling booth with a mobile and recorded the video of the election process. The bar code number visible on the VVPAT machine recorded in the video is “BVTEQ30053”, which can probably help the administration to identify the polling booth. The video was shared with Ambala returning officer-cum-deputy commissioner (DC) Shaleen, however, the response is yet awaited. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in similar cases of violation of election secrecy, Ambala police had booked Vikram Singh and Vivek Chaudhary of Lalana village, spokesperson of Jannayak Janata Party, under Section 136 of the Representation of the People Act and Section 171-F (punishment for undue influence or impersonation at an election), and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code at Ambala Sadar police station.",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch that sees its turret spinning out of control while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 18:52, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:08, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. The Russian T-90 tank was seen spinning out of control due to a bug dubbed 'spinning turret syndrome' Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s (pictured) before it malfunctioned Another piece of footage captured the moment another T-90 began spinning out of control The machine crashed into a tree which stopped the rotating However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. The impressive T-90 has been hit with an embarrassing bug where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls The T-90 tank is a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world' Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

The 35-year-old Hot Man actor got candid about his work stating how he “ruined” a take as he watched a rough cut for the first time. In his appearance on the Therapuss with Jake Shane podcast, Powell revealed he \"puked in the bushes\" after seeing his performance as the famous astronaut, John Glenn, in Hidden Figures , a 2016 historical drama. \"I remember watching Hidden Figures for the first time on the Fox lot ... and this was before all the effects were done, the music was in, the sound design ... and I literally left the movie and I puked in the bushes,\" Powell said on the podcast. Appreciating his movie stars, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, he continued, \"I was like, 'All these women put in these great performances,' and it's like, the legacy of these women. I was like, 'I literally ruined this movie.'\" Glen Powell how the rough cut took a toll, saying, \"It does get in your own head. People forget that when you're watching the rough cut of a movie, it's probably like watching the footage of yourself that you're having to edit, right? So you sit there and you're like, 'I hate myself.'\"",

        "content": "Identifying the best growth stocks for patient investors is a worthy cause. These stocks are typically characterized by their potential to grow at an above-average rate compared to the broader market. While growth stocks can offer enticing long-term growth prospects, it’s crucial to remember that true growth takes time and patience. Moreover, it’s essential to evaluate factors such as revenue growth, profit margins, and cash flows to position these companies for future success. For investors willing to adopt a long-term perspective, growth stocks can be a rewarding addition to a diversified portfolio. Let’s discover the three best growth stocks for patient investors to snap up in May! Dollarama (DOL) Dollarama (TSE: DOL.TO ), a Canadian discount retailer, has carved a niche by offering a wide range of products at competitive prices. The company has thrived since the pandemic as consumers battle inflation and higher interest rates. One of the key factors contributing to Dollarama’s success is its sufficient supply chain management and low prices. The company’s direct sourcing model allows it to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers, ensuring competitive prices for its consumers. Furthermore, over the last decade, the company has offered a more comprehensive range of products, allowing it to compete with big box retailers and grocery stores. In FY24 , Dollarama saw record revenue of $5.86 billion. Comparable sales grew 12.6%, driven by strong operations execution. Additionally, EPS increased 29% YOY to $3.56 per share, with FCF and net income surpassing $1 billion for the first time. Their business model and the compelling, valuable proposition are resonating with customers. This makes DOL stock one of the top growth stocks for patient investors in 2024. Emcor Group (EME) Emcor Group (NYSE: EME ) is a leading provider of mechanical and electrical construction services in a market with significant growth potential. Its expertise in these vital services makes it one of the most compelling growth stocks for patient investors to buy now. Emcor Group has been on an absolute tear over the last five years. The stock has significantly outperformed the broader market, rising 394% as compared to the S&P 500’s 101%. Investors anticipate growth to continue, driven by strong demand for infrastructure projects in the healthcare and technology sectors. Moreover, the company’s growing revenue, earnings, and cash flows are another positive sign for the future. In FY23 , revenue increased 13.6% YOY to $12.58 billion. EPS skyrocketed 64.7% YOY to a record $13.3 per share while generating $711 million in FCF. Management has also initiated strong forward guidance for the 2024 fiscal year. Emcor’s acquisition strategy is working, expanding its geographical reach and enhancing its long-term growth prospects. Comfort Systems USA (FIX) Comfort Systems USA (NYSE: FIX ) is revving up for another strong year in 2024. Their expertise in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) services makes them well-positioned to benefit from the rise in global infrastructure spending. Comfort Systems started off as an extremely small company that only started to hit its stride during the pandemic. The company has seen an acceleration in revenue growth and profitability as demand for HVAC services has increased substantially. Thankfully, their expertise in the fragmented HVAC market and strong brand reputation have led to repeat business. This is something that the company prides itself on, and its focus on energy-efficient HVAC solutions gives it a competitive advantage. In the 2023 fiscal year , revenue increased 26% YOY to $5.2 billion. EPS swelled 32% YOY to $9.02 per share as strong operational execution drove profitability. As demand for sustainable HVAC services continues to increase, FIX stock remains one of the best growth stocks for patient investors to buy in May.

        "content": "CUSTOMERS are reacting to self-checkout being removed in busy locations, leaving many to wait in long lines for exorbitant times. Target , which recently put in place a strict 10 items or less policy for self-checkout , has recently decided to pull the plug on that experience in one of its most populated locations in the country . Target in Emeryville, California - which serves a majority of the East Bay area , announced early this week that they were removing access to self-checkout altogether, citing a massive increase over the past few years in shoplifting . This is the only nearby Target, for many shoppers in the Oakland area, with the nearest locations being in Albany, Alameda, and Berkeley. Some shoppers, as expected, were not happy with the change and are worried that this will further impact their experience in the store. \"Target be like: we want the checkout experience to be 4 times longer,\" commented one user under the news on X, formerly Twitter. \"Still only gonna have 2 registers open at peak times,\" wrote another. \"We all know damn well there’s still gonna only be one single register open anyway,\" someone else complained . Although there are no official numbers available for this specific Target, the chain did report an overall increase of theft by 120% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same time a year prior. One customer commented that \"the honor system doesn’t work in Emeryville.\" But another user responded that he believes \"the honor system doesn't work in America, period.\" Another suggested that corporations like Target \"have lost their honor.\" \"Why should we be expected to maintain ours?,\" he asks in the post. One person joked that maybe if people keep stealing, it would actually create more available jobs in retail. But others disagreed. \"Nah,\" one replied , \"they’ll still have 2 people running registers while 30 people wait in line.\" Over the last two years, Target cut over 35,000 jobs , or almost 8% of its total national workforce, according to company records. This cut has resulted in a major downsizing in the number of available cashiers in any location Since this change, customers have been complaining all over social media about being forced to wait in long lines with even longer wait times, frustrating those who may only have a few items in the absence of self-checkout. The chain also announced this month that prices of over 5,000 everyday items would be lowered in the store. This decision has led many customers to speculate on social media that Target has been actively price gouging. \"Alternative headline: Target confesses to blatantly price gouging millions of consumers, no penalties expected,\" one viral post said . \"Target was price gouging you to hell while claiming inflation pressure and lost a s**t ton of customers,\" another post read. \"So they’ll return prices to normal and pretend they’re giving you a deal.\" Target has not responded to the U.S. Sun's request for comment.",

        "content": "THANE: Following the announcement of Abhijit Panse as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate for the Konkan Graduate Constituency , Panse launched a scathing critique of the BJP, accusing the party of failing to deliver constructive projects for graduates. The MNS's decision to field Panse against the BJP is expected to escalate the political contest in the region. The BJP is preparing to field Niranjan Davkhare, the current Member of Legislative Council (MLC), for the same seat. This move by MNS leader Raj Thackeray is seen as a strategic effort to bolster the party's presence in the region and challenge the BJP's dominance. Panse alleged that no significant projects benefiting graduates have been undertaken in the last 12 years. He criticised the BJP for the constituency's lack of development and announced that, rather than a traditional manifesto, the MNS would present a detailed, job-oriented manifesto tailored to the specific needs of the constituency. When asked about the potential for supporting the BJP in this election, Panse stressed that the MNS follows Raj Thackeray's directives. He noted that any decisions regarding alliances would be made by Thackeray himself. MNS Thane Palghar District President Avinash Jadhav confirmed that there have been no discussions between the MNS and the BJP regarding this election.",

The 37-year-old Spaniard lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev at the French Open and afterwards said his priority was the Olympics back in Paris. Asked if he would play Wimbledon, an event he has won twice, he replied: 'Looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but for me now looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having Olympics again on clay. 'I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with my team. I need to analyze so many facts. 'But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay, no? Rafael Nadal has admitted he may skip Wimbledon this year to avoid transitioning to grass Nadal, 37, was knocked out of the French Open after losing to Alex Zverev in the first round The all-time great says he is being wary of overexertion after suffering numerous injuries 'Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.' Nadal has won two Wimbledon titles among his tally of 22 Grand Slams, having triumphed in 2008 and 2010. He last competed in SW19 in 2022. After reaching the semi-finals, Nadal was forced to withdraw from his match against Nick Kyrgios due to an untimely injury and has not returned since. His latest announcement may mean that Nadal's storied career at Wimbledon is over - with the all-time legend admitting he may be in the midst of his final year on tour. Speaking after his defeat by Zverev, Nadal told the crowd: 'I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you. If it is, I have enjoyed it.

        "description": "Southampton clinched promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year exile as Adam Armstrong sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday.The post Southampton sink Leeds, return to PL appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "LONDON – Southampton clinched promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year exile as Adam Armstrong sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Armstrong’s first-half strike at Wembley ensured Southampton erased the bitter taste of last year’s relegation from the top-flight with an immediate return. Victory in football’s single richest match will give Southampton an estimated $178 million windfall due to the increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue for clubs who reach the Premier League. Financial experts Deloitte say Southampton could eventually bank £305 million if they avoid relegation next season. While the cash prize is a huge bonus, it is the prestige of competing with Manchester City and Arsenal, rather than second-tier minnows like Plymouth and Oxford, that fuelled Southampton’s hunger to regain their Premier League status after a year in purgatory. Southampton, whose only major honour is the 1976 FA Cup, had spent 11 years in the Premier League prior to their relegation. In their first ever play-off final, Southampton made it three wins over Leeds this term despite finishing three points behind the Elland Road club in the regular season. Saints boss Russell Martin has become widely admired for his purist passing principles and this was the 38-year-old’s crowning glory. Martin was managing in League One with Milton Keynes Dons just three years ago, but he has transformed Southampton in his first season in charge, to such an extent that they boasted more possession than any team in Europe’s top five leagues this season. “I’m so pleased for the board because I was not an exciting appointment for them. I finished 10th at Swansea, but we had a really clear way of doing things at MK (Dons) and here, so for them to take me on was really brave,” Martin said. “The team have been so brave. I’m really grateful and proud of them. They deserve it.” Securing promotion at Leeds boss Daniel Farke’s expense was a sweet moment for Martin after his Norwich contract was terminated by the German during their time together at Carrow Road in 2018. Defeat was a bitter blow for Farke and Leeds, who were relegated alongside Southampton last season. On the 35th anniversary of the death of their legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds were well below their best in the club’s fourth play-off final loss. After losing their grip on an automatic promotion place that went instead to Ipswich, the three-time English champions remain without a win at Wembley since 1992. Leeds made a fast start but Southampton weathered the storm and snatched the lead in the 24th minute. Armstrong had scored twice in the play-off semi-final win over West Brom and the striker showcased his predatory instincts again with his 24th goal this season. Cleverly eluding the Leeds offside trap with a well-timed run, Armstrong met Will Smallbone’s pass with a superb strike into the far corner from 12 yards. Leeds were rocked and Armstrong nearly struck again from another instinctive shot from Smallbone’s quick free-kick, but this time Illan Meslier was able to parry his close-range effort. Early in the second half, Leeds defender Joe Rodon embarked on a rampaging run that looked certain to end in a goal until Taylor Harwood-Bellis threw himself into a last-ditch block. Leeds pushed hard for an equaliser, but Daniel James’ blast cannoned back off the bar before the winger was denied by Alex McCarthy’s stoppage-time save as Southampton celebrated their return to the promised land.",

(AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis) ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail , their lawyers said Monday. A judge in the southern town of Nafplio on Tuesday is expected to hear a legal appeal for their release, the lawyers told a press conference in Athens. “The decision for their detention is not legal, and has no justification,” said Effie Dousi, one of the lawyers. The nine men were among the 104 survivors of an overcrowded fishing trawler that sank in international waters off southwestern Greece on June 14, 2023, en route from Libya to Italy. A total 82 bodies were recovered, but hundreds more people are feared lost in one of the worst migrant shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. Greek authorities accused the nine of being among the trawler’s crew — something the defense denied — and brought criminal charges against them including for people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. But last week a judge in the southern city of Kalamata dismissed the case after a prosecutor argued that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the trawler sank outside its waters. Greece’s coast guard was widely criticized for failing to prevent the sinking, despite having a vessel close by, and some survivors claimed the trawler foundered after the coast guard tried to tow it. The coast guard strongly denied that. A separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the coast guard’s actions is still underway. Dousi said the nine, who have applied for asylum in Greece, had already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and should now be at liberty. “These are survivors of a shipwreck,” she said, adding that if the Nafplio court rules against their release, the nine will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers said the Egyptians are being held in police cells in Nafplio and Athens, and in a migrant detention center in Corinth, southern Greece. They said police ordered their administrative detention because they have no given address in Greece, lack identity papers and allegedly pose a flight risk. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

        "content": "A female American soldier was found murdered inside a locked bedroom in her apartment off the Army base where she served. The body of Private First Class Katia Duenas-Aguilar, 23, was discovered in her residence in Clarksville, Tennessee, by her friend, WTVF reported. Clarkesville detectives who responded to the residence near the border with Kentucky on May 18 ruled her death a homicide. Duenas-Aguilar was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade. ‘We are stunned by the death of Pfc Duenas-Aguilar,’ 101st Airborne Division spokesman Lt Col Tony Hoefler told Military.com . ‘In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with Army and local investigative authorities on this matter.’ Duenas-Aguilar, of Mesquite, Texas, was the single mother of a four-year-old boy. She shared the apartment with another person and was the only victim, police said. ‘We want to know what happened, who did it and we want to make sure that person or people are brought to justice,’ stated her family, according to CBS News . On Saturday, Duenas-Aguilar’s family begged for the public’s help and along with the League of United Latin American Citizens announced a doubling of the reward amount to $55,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Duenas-Aguilar joined the US Army in 2018 and received her training at Fort Eisenhower. She was awarded two Army Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon. ‘We want to believe that it’s a nightmare that we can wake up and she will still be there,’ Ruiz-Aguilar said. Duenas-Aguilar’ death comes after after three US Marines were found dead inside a parked car at a gas station near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina where they were stationed.

Walton, survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris, was a two-time NBA champion, winning one title with the Portland Trail Blazers and another with the Boston Celtics . He is also one of the greatest college basketball players of all time, winning three consecutive national college player of the year awards between 1972 and 1974 and two NCAA titles with the UCLA Bruins. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, both on the court and off. After retiring, Walton overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 and being named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time in 2009. NBA hall of fame center Bill Walton has died at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer Walton is survived by his wife Lori (above) and his four sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris Walton was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers and won his first NBA championship in Oregon Walton (far right) with Celtics teammates Danny Ainge, Rick Carlisle and Larry Bird in 1986 Walton (left) overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 'Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. 'As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. 'Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. 'But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. 'I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. 'As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.' His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Walton's NBA career lasted only 468 games because he struggled with chronic foot injuries NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Walton 'was truly one of a kind' in an emotional statement Walton was selected with the No. 1 pic in the 1974 NBA draft, and won his first NBA Championship with the Trail Blazers three years later. After struggling with those foot problems, Walton's career took off again when he signed with the Celtics in 1985 for two seasons. Alongside Larry Bird, Walton collected his second NBA Championship in 1986. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. 'Bill Walton,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, 'was truly one of a kind.' 'It ́s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA ́s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,' UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. 'Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it ́s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. 'As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. 'For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It ́s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.' More to follow.

        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, has urged members of the National Assembly not pass the Bill mandating the country to revert to the old National Anthem through legislative fiat. LEADERSHIP reports both chambers of the National Assembly had last week expeditiously pass a Bill for an Act to revert to the old Nigeria’s National Anthem – ‘Nigeria, We Hail Thee..’ But, Fagbemi warned that such an important Bill on the national anthem should not be done by legislative fiat. Speaking at the public hearing on the Bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters in Abuja on Monday, AGF Fagbemi warned that the issue of National Anthem should not be treated with legislative fiat without giving Nigerians a say. He said as commendable as the move by both chambers of the National Assembly may be, on enacting law on the National Anthem or replacing the current one with the old one, Nigerians must be carried along for their required “buy-in”. The AGF said: “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” In his submission at the public hearing, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to mere change of national anthem. The Minister, who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem being advocated by the lawmakers, do not make a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it,” he said. Also cautioning the National Assembly on the expeditious passage of the Bill into law, renowned lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots” anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” version, which the country started with at independence in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978, does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace its National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past. Other stakeholders in their submissions spoke in preference for the old National Anthem against the current one.",

Swann was put against Something in his place, with Navarro taking Swann’s place against Laredo Kid. In an interview with Fightful ), Navarro spoke about his last minute appearance on the show. He said: “ Oh man, it was great. I mean, originally, you know, I wasn’t even supposed to be a part of that man. I wasn’t going to go. I wrestled Ali. Ali kind of was like, oh, maybe you should come. I was like, oh, maybe, you know, I wrestle like a lot that weekend too. Like I have like a show that following Saturday and the Sunday as well. So I was like, oh, you know, maybe, you know, I’m tired. Cause I’ve been on the go since the last week of February. So like my body, you know, it’s catching up. I’m feeling it. I wanted to be, I want to be a hundred percent for Super Strong Style. You know, I knew it was the pay-per-view that day. So I was like, ah, you know, most of the time it’s pay-per-view. There’s a high chance you’re not doing anything. You know what I mean? Unless you’re doing like a backstage thing. But I know it kind of at this point, it’s kind of hard to make me do a backstage thing with my hair. We showed up late. We showed up late, you know, because we were just going to watch and see everybody. We left to get food for two hours. I walked back in and they’re telling me, get your stuff. You’re wrestling Laredo in the main event of the countdown. I’m like, I just ain’t doing it. I wish somebody told me. But, like, that’s that, like, hey, man, something told me to bring my gear anyway. You should always bring your gear. And I just brought it just because. I mean, I would have never expected wrestling on the pay-per-view that day. Never, never, never. But I had to be ready. The doors are opening in an hour. You know, card’s subject to change. They said it on commentary. You never know. I was there. I was ready. Put my stuff on. Let’s go. I’m fighting for a title. I’ll add another one. Let’s go. I’ll take it. ”",

The Made For You crooner, In a heartfelt post on his Instagram page on Thursday, expressed gratitude to God for his recovery. Banky W thanked his wife, family, friends, and pastors for their unwavering support and prayers, as well as his medical team, Dr. Onyewu and Dr. Adenuga, for their expertise and care. Sharing a video he wrote, “Christ 4 – Cancer Tumors 0 “Sometimes, your faith in God will not prevent the storms from coming... but it will carry you through them. Faith won’t always stop you from hurting, but it will help you heal, and it will help you deal. “God never said the weapons wouldn’t form, He promised that they wouldn’t prosper. He never said the enemy wouldn’t come... He promised that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God would raise a standard against him. “Posting this testimony to encourage anyone out there who is going through a challenge. It might seem bigger than you, but greater is He that is in you than anything you will face in this world. “Grateful for my wife, family, friends, and Pastors for their love, prayers, and support. Thanking God for my health and trusting that this latest victory is final in Jesus’ name. “Appreciating the gifted hands and minds of my doctors, Dr. Onyewu of the Center for Advanced Specialty Surgery, and Dr. Adenuga of Euracare and the teams that support them. “We have the victory yet again. Now and forever, in Jesus’ name. “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” – Romans 8:28′′",

        "content": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract with the club after taking them into next season’s Champions League. The 52-year-old Spaniard has turned Villa around since arriving from Villarreal in October 2022 with the club sitting 17th in the Premier League. Emery led them to seventh place in his first season in charge and fourth in this campaign. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club,” said Emery, whose existing deal still had another three years to run. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. “We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams,” he said. Emery also took Villa, the 1982 European Cup champions, to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season in their first European campaign for 13 years. The club’s Chairman Nassef Sawiris said, “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core, and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Aston Villa undoubtedly want to bolster their squad this summer after the superb achievement of reaching the Champions League – but the news that manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract means they have already captured the most vital signature of all. Emery extended his current deal until 2027 in April but this was always with the intention of a longer-term extension once the season finished. Villa have wasted no time in tying up their inspirational manager for the future. The Spaniard has overseen a stunning rejuvenation of Villa since succeeding the sacked Steven Gerrard in October 2022. Emery’s new contract is a sign of ambition from Villa’s owners but also an indication of the faith he has in them, in partnership with his long-time associate, Villa’s president of football operations Monchi. The fact that Emery has taken them into the Champions League was beyond fans’ most optimistic expectations this season. Emery has put Villa ahead of schedule but there will be no complaints as they mix with the Champions League big names for the first time. They will feel confident of making an impact under a manager with such pedigree in the European environment, one who already has four second-tier Europa League titles to his name. He has already assumed hero status at Villa Park and it will be a source of joy to everyone at the club that Emery has now signed up until 2029.",

        "description": "Minister of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker has been accused of a “lack of effort” after a leaked memo from Conservative Campaign Headquarters appeared to criticise his decision to continue his holiday in Greece during parliamentary recess.",
        "content": "Mr Baker, who is the MP for Wycombe, has been Northern Ireland Minister since September 2022. His name was just one of several listed in a leaked memo obtained by The Times, which criticised several Tory MPs and their activities following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s snap election announcement last week. Mr Baker is currently in Greece where he told the Daily Mirror he will be doing his “campaign work”. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” The memo said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign in the election announcement. Cheadle MP Mary Robinson was also referred to as being “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo revealed and that the seat of veterans’ minister Johnny Mercer “had an issue” with the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.” The criticism of MPs comes as Mr Baker revealed the decision to create a mandatory national service policy from the PM which has been widely criticised and mocked “I don’t like to be pedantic but a government policy would have been developed by ministers on the advice of officials and collectively agreed,” he posted on X, formerly Twitter, in response to an opinion piece written by the Belfast Telegraph’s Allison Morris. “I would have had a say on behalf of [Northern Ireland]. But this proposal was developed by a political adviser or advisers and sprung on candidates, some of whom are relevant ministers.” He later defended his remarks in a post on his website writing he is standing for his constituents in Wycombe: “I am for liberty under the rule of law and Parliamentary democracy. \"History has proven time and time again that liberty under law – not compulsion and planning – is the surest road to peace and prosperity.”",

        "content": "What your BELLY BUTTON reveals about your health, according to experts READ MORE: Doctors warn why you should clean inside your belly button By Emily Joshu Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 18:39, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:55, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Most of us probably don't give our belly button a second thought. However, this small fold of skin could be a host for infections , cysts, and even hernias, experts suggest. Dr Dan Baumgardt, a neuroscientist and physiologist at the University of Bristol in the UK, wrote for The Conversation that the belly button - known medically as the navel - 'has more depth to it than just a few millimeters.' The belly button is a remnant of the umbilical cord, which connects a fetus to its mother during pregnancy. There are many variations, but the two main groups are 'outies' and 'innies.' Roughly 10 percent of people around the world have an outie, meaning their belly button is protruding, while the remainder have an innie. Most people have an 'innie,' belly button, meaning that the flap of skin folds in rather than protrouding out While the belly button has no function after birth, subtle changes to the way it appears could be an indicator that something is wrong with our health. One of these, Dr Baumgardt notes, is an umbilical hernia, which occurs when part of the intestine bulges through the belly button. This causes swelling or a bulge coming out of the navel. These are usually harmless and mainly affect infants, though they are also the second most common hernia in adults. Being overweight or having multiple pregnancies can increase the risk of adults developing an umbilical hernia. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: health@dailymail.com Advertisement Most of the time, no treatment is needed, though the hernia may need to be surgically removed if it causes pain or blocks the intestine. Dr Baumgardt also pointed to a rare complication called Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, which is named after a nun who discovered that many patients with late-stage cancer had swelling or a nodule near their belly button. This can be a sign that patient's cancer has spread or become more advanced. 'It’s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs,' Dr Baumgardt writes. Another unusual condition of caput medusae, or Medusa's head. Also called a palm tree sign, this is a network of painless, swollen veins around the belly button. From a distance, it also looks like a black or blue bruise. This is caused by portal hypertension, which is high pressure in the portal vein. The portal vein carried blood to the liver from the intestines, gall bladder, pancreas, and spleen. The liver then processes nutrients in the blood and sends it to the heart. Medusa's head (left) and Sister Mary Joseph nodule (right) are two rare conditions that form in or around the belly button Medusa's head on its own is not a disease, though it is usually a sign of liver scarring, also called cirrhosis. The scarring makes it harder for blood to flow through the liver's veins, causing it to build up in the portal vein and flow to nearby veins near the belly button. This enlarges those blood vessels into a Medusa-like pattern. The belly button can also harbor infections, especially if you have an innie. This fold can trap moisture and debris, and warm environments like this are prime environments for bacteria to grow. Signs of an infection in the belly button include redness, pain, swelling, foul smell, and pus or other fluids leaking out.

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "description": "Additional Public Order Policing units are being deployed in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha to bolster existing crime combatting efforts.",
        "content": "In a significant move to enhance law enforcement in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha in the Eastern Cape , additional Public Order Policing (POP) units are being deployed to bolster existing crime combatting efforts. This initiative was highlighted during a send-off parade in Harrismith, where the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS), General Fannie Masemola, addressed over 700 POP officers. Maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections General Masemola emphasised the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections. He tasked the officers with preventing and combating criminal activities while ensuring that South Africans can exercise their right to vote in peace. “We are sending you off to maintain law and order. No disruptions and acts of criminality should take place under your watch. We are sending you out there to protect the constitutional right of South Africans and the integrity of the election process,” said General Masemola. Aim of the police deployment in these regions The deployment aims to enhance the capacity of the current law enforcement presence in these regions. This comes in response to recent tensions in Mthatha , where roadblocks have been a significant issue. General Masemola confirmed that police forces have been fully mobilised to address these challenges, and five individuals have been arrested for attempting to block roads leading to Mthatha Airport. Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili, Co-chair of the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS), also participated in the send-off parade. She urged the officers to perform their duties within the legal framework, underscoring the importance of lawful conduct during these operations. Earlier reports indicated a tense situation in Mthatha, which caused several roads to be closed. At around 9:00, five suspects were arrested following an altercation where shots were fired at POP and Mthatha Vispol members. Two suspects were injured, and two firearms were confiscated. Authorities have opened cases of attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms for further investigation. According to Jacaranda FM , by Monday afternoon, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said that he had asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to send the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to Mthatha to help maintain order and restore calm. Additionally, Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nomthetheleli Mene issued a stern warning against the circulation of videos and messages inciting unrest. “Such actions are not only irresponsible but also illegal. We will take strict action against anyone found to be engaging in activities that threaten the safety and security of the public and the integrity of the election process,” she stated.",

        "content": "In the run-up to the final adoption of Georgia’s “foreign agents” law, the United States prepared to on members of the Georgian Dream party responsible for promoting it and obstructing the country’s Euro-Atlantic integration. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department that it was introducing a new visa restriction policy against a wide range of Georgian officials and their family members, as well as those who participated in the use of violence against protesters on the streets of Tbilisi. The visa restrictions are only the first stage of sanctions pressure on sub-sanctioned persons, which is typically followed by freezing of assets in U.S. jurisdictions and restrictions on financial transactions. Each of these measures requires additional explanation, if only because some representatives of the Georgian Dream claim that and even ask to be in the “honorary register of patriots,” apparently believing that they will cause only minor harm to them and their families. In order to understand the effect of sanctions, it would be useful for the members of Georgian Dream to refer to the long experience of Russian individuals on the sanctions lists. This measure applies to property and property rights, including cash, securities, interests in companies and other property located in the U.S. jurisdiction. This means that a house, apartment, car, or business asset located in the U.S., as well as a current account, deposit, or bank card opened in a U.S. bank, may be subject to the freeze. For example, shortly after the U.K. froze the assets of Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Fridman, he that he did not know how to pay for even small expenses, such as cleaning his house abroad. Another sanctioned Russian billionaire, Pyotr Aven, he did not understand how to survive because “everything we have built over 30 years is now completely destroyed.” The American jurisdiction has a much broader scope than the British one, so a person caught under the asset freeze can say goodbye to his financial assets and property located in Western countries, as well as forget about the possibility of building and developing any business there. This ban not only prevents the sanctioned person from entering the United States, but also results in the suspension of visas issued to family members, for example to study at a U.S. university. For example, if a visa ban is imposed on Irakli Garibashvili, the chairman of Georgian Dream, it is likely that he will not be able to visit his son who is studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Since this measure will also apply to his family members, it is likely that Garibashvili’s son will also be forced to suspend his studies there. It should be noted separately that if visas are banned for such Georgian Dream deputies as Aluda Gudushauri, Beka Odisharia or Irakli Chikovani, their US-born and US-citizen children will be directly affected by the very harsh US sanctions legislation, which provides for criminal liability for violations of the sanctions regime. The deputies themselves and their families will no longer be able to visit the United States, even for tourism. In the context of visa restrictions, it will be useful for Georgian Dream members to familiarize themselves with the experience of another Russian oligarch and billionaire, Oleg Deripaska. Although he was subject to US sanctions in 2018, he nevertheless to circumvent them in order to organize the birth of his two children on US territory, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the machinations were exposed, and Deripaska and his associates, including the arrested , were charged with conspiracy to evade sanctions, which carries up to 20 years in prison. It is noteworthy that in 2022, for violating or circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia. It is also worth recalling that last year the USA imposed on four high-ranking and their families, which became the first case of application of the sanctions mechanism in the history of Georgian-American relations. The measure was so painful for the ruling party that some members of Georgian Dream the U.S. decision and even categorically demanded that it be lifted. At the same time, the parliamentary majority, despite its confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Georgian judiciary, prevented the establishment of a temporary investigative commission to investigate corruption in the judiciary. This measure denies a sanctioned person access to a significant part of the international financial system. For example, he/she cannot use bank cards that use the U.S. payment systems Visa or Mastercard are blocked, and his/her ability to conduct banking and financial transactions in U.S. dollars is suspended. In addition, because Georgia does not have its own payment system, such as Russia’s MIR or China’s UnionPay, the sanctioned person will not be able to use Visa or Mastercard bank cards, even those issued by Georgian banks, and will face restrictions on accessing bank assets and conducting transactions in Georgia itself. The painfulness of this measure for the Georgian authorities can be judged by the scandalous story of the imposition of in September 2023 against the “Georgian-Russian oligarch”, citizen of Georgia and General of the country . Shortly after the sanctions were imposed against him, the National Bank of Georgia denied Partskhaladze access to accounts and banking operations in the country. The next day, however, the bank’s acting president, Natia Turnava, single-handedly her decision under the alleged pressure from the then-leader of Georgian Dream. Top managers who disagreed with the decision resigned from the bank, and major Georgian commercial banks refused to obey the decision and continued to comply with the sanctions regime. Partskhaladze, in turn, with the assistance of the Georgian Ministry of Justice, expedited the transfer of his Georgian assets (12 properties, including land, residential and commercial premises, and the family church) , after which the Ministry revoked his Georgian citizenship to reduce sanctions risks for Georgia. It is difficult to assess the financial cost of sanctions, as each case is different. One year after the sanctions were imposed, Deripaska his losses at $7.5 billion, while Fridman recently $15.8 billion for the freezing of his assets in Luxembourg. *** Being under US sanctions has another very important consequence: huge majority of Western countries, including EU countries, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan and a number of others, are traditionally US allies. So we can expect them to share data on the activities of sanctioned individuals in their countries with their U.S. counterparts, and possibly seek to add those individuals to their own sanctions lists. Cases of lifting sanctions are isolated, such as the case of banker Oleg Tinkov, who his Russian citizenship, and are possible only when sanctioned individuals clearly distance themselves from the ruling party and go through complicated court procedures. Nevertheless, Georgian Dream seems to have decided that it had calculated all these risks well, and faced with the dilemma of refusing to adopt the law on “foreign agents” and being placed on the U.S. sanctions lists, it chose the latter, hoping to retain its power at the cost of into authoritarianism and Russia’s orbit. However, judging by the of the leaders of Georgian Dream to the position of Georgia’s strategic partners – the EU and the U.S., their comments on the Venice Commission’s remarks and against the European Commissioner Varhely, and other similar actions, the ruling party is calculating its moves by no more than one step ahead.

        "content": "Delhi’s Tis Hazari Court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Delhi Chief Minister’s aide Bibhav Kumar in connection with the alleged assault of Aam Aadmi Party MP Swati Maliwal. The court said that the investigation is at an initial stage and that the chances of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sushil Anuj Tyagi said, “The investigation is still at the nascent stage and the apprehension of influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence cannot be ruled out. Keeping in view the allegations made against the applicant, at this stage, no ground for bail is made out.” “The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days. There seems to be no pre-meditation on the part of the victim as if it would have been so, then the FIR would have been registered on the same day,” ASJ Tyagi said in the order passed on May 27. The court while dismissing the bail plea noted that the victim is a sitting Member of Parliament from the Aam Aadmi Party and as per her allegations, she has been brutally beaten up at the CM’s house by the applicant. The applicant was present at the CM’s house even after his employment was terminated, the court further observed. The investigating agency has also reported that the applicant has formatted his mobile phone and has not provided the password for opening his mobile phone. The CCTV footage collected from the CM’s camp office is also stated to be blank, the court noted in the order. The judge said that it has come on record that the complainant was medically examined on May 16, 2024, at AIIMS Hospital. Her statement under section 164 CrPC was recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. Her version as mentioned in the complaint finds corroboration from the MLC and her statement recorded under section 164 CrPC. The court stated that the applicant (Bibhav Kumar) was joined in the investigation, but as per the investigation officer, he did not cooperate in the investigation and was arrested to prevent him from tampering with crucial evidence. During the arguments, the counsel for the complainant argued that the victim is the sitting MP of the Aam Aadmi Party and earlier also, she has gone to meet the CM and she cannot be termed as a trespasser, rather it was the applicant/accused who was present in the CM office without any authority. It was further contended that no one reported the matter to the police from the CM office and it was the complainant who made the complaint to the police from the spot itself. It was also argued that the magnitude of the injuries was such that they were present even after four days when the medical examination was done. He contended that the complainant has an association with the CM since past nine years and she was brutally assaulted. She went to the police station but due to trauma, she did not lodge a complaint. It was further contended that the applicant made a complaint on May 17, 2024, at 3.34 pm through e-mail when the complainant had already reported the matter to the police. It was also contended that the complainant is receiving threats of death and rape through vulgar messages on social media. It was contended that the applicant is not simply a PA of CM but he is a very influential person with whom the complainant is apprehending danger. It is therefore prayed that bail cannot be granted to the applicant",

        "content": "T he Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and its allies, a group that produces 40% of the world’s crude, wants to keep oil prices high and stable. Lately they have certainly been stable, even if not that high. Despite the recent death of Iran’s president and the escalating war in Gaza, prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, have stayed within $2 of $82 a barrel since the start of May. Part of the reason why OPEC is failing to keep prices high is because its members are failing to keep to their output targets. In March the group’s leaders and Russia extended production cuts, vowing a reduction of 2.2m barrels a day (b/d), or 2% of global supply, until the end of June, on top of 3.7m b/d of previously agreed cuts for 2024. Yet the cartel is now overproducing so much that its daily output in 2024 is little changed from the last quarter of 2023. This will create tensions when members get together to decide their strategy at OPEC ’s ministerial meeting on June 2nd. The mystery matters for global economic growth Politicians must act now to avert the worst Farewell to a financial mystery",

Podcast By Tum Balogun Published: 13:48 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:30 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Chris Sutton believes that 'show pony' Antony has let Erik ten Hag down with his performances for Manchester United . The Brazilian, who had joined his old Ajax boss at Old Trafford for a £85.5million fee in 2022, managed only three goals and two assists in a dismal campaign that also saw him lose his place in the starting line-up. On Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off! podcast, Sutton insisted that the Red Devils winger was the biggest underperformer of the 2023-24 season. '[Antony] actually made me look value for money,' the former Blues striker Sutton joked. 'For the outlay on him, in terms of goals and assists they just simply haven't been there. He is a show pony. That's what he is and I think he's let Erik ten Hag down.' However, Sutton's IAKO co-host Ian Ladyman disagreed and instead opted for Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo as his flop of the campaign. The 22-year-old was at the centre a high-profile tussle between Liverpool and Chelsea last summer before he eventually completed a move to Stamford Bridge for a British record £115million fee. Additionally, Sutton and Ladyman also revealed their choices for the biggest overachievers - which happened to involve two players with Chelsea connections.

However, a lot more went into the shot according to the YouTube star, who revealed he thought of the idea over a year ago. “I’ve been dreaming of that shot for a year,” , sharing a conversation with his boss back in May 2023 where he first suggested the stunt. “Wanted to run this idea by y’all as we approach our next two PLE’s... I pitched this for WrestleMania but apparently had some venue issues.

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "content": "(CNS): A Caymanian woman who worked for a floor covering company has admitted stealing $42,000 from her former employer, Randolph Stanford, using over a dozen forged cheques between November 2021 and March 2022. Samantha Angella McLaughlin has pleaded guilty to 16 charges of theft and forgery and has been bailed until an expected sentencing hearing in July. McLaughlin appeared in Grand Court on Friday and admitted a long list of charges. The crown had accepted a dispute over one cheque she allegedly forged, which reduced the original amount of the theft from $49,000 to $42,000. The court ordered a social inquiry report, and McLaughlin was bailed to appear for her sentencing hearing on 26 July.",

        "description": "At UCLA, Walton was a three-time National Player of the Year. In the NBA, he won the MVP in the 1977-78 season, and was a two-time champion.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. This story will be updated.",

I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said.

(AP Photo/Michael Owen Baker) JUSTICEPHOTO.COM Bill Walton at ROTH Conference Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves.

        "content": "Novak Djokovic was seen walking out of Rafael Nadal’s French Open match against Alexander Zverev on Monday after just the second set. Djokovic was among a number of famous faces on Philippe-Chatrier to see Nadal play Roland-Garros for possibly the last time before he hangs up his racket . The world No.1 Serbian was pictured in the crowd, while fellow tennis stars Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were also in attendance, as was Manchester City’s Rodri. The atmosphere on Philippe-Chatrier was electric with almost everyone there passionately supporting Nadal, who has won 14 French Open men’s singles titles. It was a stark contrast to the hostile reception Djokovic got at last year’s Wimbledon final, with the Serbian loudly booed and goading spectators . Like Nadal and the French Open, Djokovic has become almost synonymous with Wimbledon due to his dominance at the grass-court Grand Slam. But he does not seem to be as loved as his fellow tennis legend and it is possible that Djokovic grew tired with the Nadal love-in as he decided to leave the court. Djokovic is watching too ð #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/vcJAaWQIf9 ‘Djokovic and Swiatek left after the 2nd set,’ @josemorgado posted on X. ‘But Carlos Alcaraz is still here on Chatrier with his dad and agent.’ Djokovic plays his first-round match at the French Open on Tuesday as he faces French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert. The 24-time Grand Slam champion hasn’t been in the best form in the build-up to Roland-Garros and has been coy about his chances of defending his title.

You know, I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are. ‘You know, anything but a title for me is not satisfactory, you know. So it always has been like that. I know, you know, it might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up. ‘In a way, me playing still at this highest level, one of the major reasons is trying to write more history of the sport and win the biggest titles that, you know, Paris is definitely one of them. So that’s why my hopes and goals are always the same, but I have to lower the expectations.’ MORE : Rafael Nadal suffers French Open first-round heartbreak to controversial rival MORE : Enzo Maresca and Kieran McKenna show clubs promoted to Premier League face fight to keep managers MORE : Andy Murray proud of French Open legacy despite ‘issue’ with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic",

With his future at the club beyond June 2025 now uncertain, have reported that the Citizens have earmarked Girona boss Michel as the man to replace their current manager. It has been suggested that the Sky Blues' hierarchy admire the LALIGA coach's tactical prowess, as well as his ability to nurture young talent. It is believed they feel those characteristics are key to helping the club maintain what Guardiola has already put in place. Michel took over at Girona in 2021, and guided them to promotion from the Spanish second tier in his first season. The following campaign, the side finished 10th in LALIGA with 49 points. Most recently, in the 2023/24 season, he led them to a third-place finish with 81 points, four behind Barcelona and 14 behind eventual league winners Real Madrid. While the 48-year-old has reportedly caught the eye of those at the Etihad, there are other candidates who have been shortlisted as potential Guardiola replacements, with the list believed to also include former Brighton & Hove Albion boss Roberto De Zerbi, Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso.",

        "content": "The RAF has grounded a fleet of Spitfire planes after the death of a pilot over the weekend, raising the prospect of the legendary aircraft being absent from the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings next month. Sqn Ldr Mark Long – a Typhoon pilot based at RAF Coningsby – was killed in a crash while flying a Spitfire belonging to the Battle of Britain Memorial Fleet as part of a memorial event. He had been a pilot with the BBMF for the last four years and had been due to take over the event next year. “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” an RAF spokesperson said. The air force announcement raises questions about the legendary single-seat fighter aircraft’s participation in the D-day celebrations. They were due to take part in a national commemorative event in Portsmouth on 5 June to mark 80 years since Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy in northern France, turning the tide of the second world war away from Nazi Germany. It is not known when the RAF’s investigation will be complete or when a decision will be made on whether the vintage planes will fly again. King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders – including Joe Biden, the US president, Emmanual Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor – in Normandy for the memorial celebrations. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The BBMF is a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. A few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six based at RAF Coningsby. Paying tribute to Long, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the Display Air Wing, said on Sunday: “It is with great sorrow that I must confirm the death of Sqn Ldr Mark Long. “Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him.” “An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun.” The Prince and Princess of Wales led tributes to Long, writing on social media: “Our thoughts ... are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C.”",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Laurence Tognetti, Universe Today How can sunlight reflecting off SpaceX's Starlink satellites interfere with ground-based operations? This is what a study recently posted to the arXiv preprint server hopes to address as a pair of researchers investigate how Starlink satellites appear brighter—which the researchers also refer to as flaring—to observers on Earth when the sun is at certain angles, along with discussing past incidents of how this brightness has influenced aerial operations on Earth. This study holds the potential to help spacecraft manufacturers design and develop specific methods to prevent increased brightness levels, which would help alleviate confusion for observers on Earth regarding the source of the brightness and the objects in question. Here, Universe Today discusses this research with Anthony Mallama of the IAU—Center for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies from Satellite Constellation Interference regarding the motivation behind the study, significant results, potential follow-up studies, importance of studying Starlink satellite brightness, and implications for managing satellite constellations in the future. So, what was the motivation behind this study? \"I study the brightness of Starlink satellites under all circumstances,\" Mallama tells Universe Today. \"That includes their operational phase at 550 km [342 mi] altitude, when they are rising from the initial orbit around 300 km [186 mi] to operation height, ordinary flares which occur frequently but have small amplitudes and these extreme flares.\" For the study, the researchers conducted a geometrical analysis of the brightness of Starlink satellites based on the sun's location and angle in the sky. This comes despite SpaceX taking steps to mitigate reflectivity off Starlink satellites, which only decreases reflectivity when the satellites are directly overhead. The study also discussed how reflectivity from Starlink satellites has affected aerial operations, specifically with commercial airline pilots. What were the most significant results from this study? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"This study demonstrated that Starlinks can be exceedingly bright under certain conditions. In one instance they were reported as Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) by pilots on two commercial aircraft.\" Regarding potential follow-up studies, Mallama tells Universe Today, \"I am characterizing the brightness of other satellite constellations including Amazon's Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker/BlueBirds and Planet's Pelicans.\" The study mentions how the UAP incidents occurred in 2022 and was recently discussed in Buettner et al (2024) with the pilots' reporting brightness magnitudes (also called stellar magnitude or apparent magnitude) of -4 to -5. For context, a stellar magnitude of -5 is equivalent to the planet Venus at its brightest, which is known for being observed before sunrise or after sunset periodically throughout the year. The apparent magnitude scale ranges from -30 to 30 with higher numbers corresponding to decreasing brightness. Buettner et al (2024) was recently presented at the 4th IAA Conference on Space Situational Awareness ( ICSSA ). That paper discussed how the incident occurred on August 10, 2022, and was observed by five pilots aboard two separate commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in two photographs obtained by the pilot's cell phones. After analyzing a series of simulations and additional data, the researchers determined these UAPs were Starlink satellites launched earlier that day, which were designated as Starlink Group 4-26. Given this incident, what is the importance of studying Starlink brightness/flaring? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"The importance of studying Starlink brightness is that the satellites interfere with astronomical research if they are brighter than magnitude 7. Furthermore, casual sky watchers, such as amateur astronomers and naturalists, are distracted by those brighter than magnitude 6 because they are visible to the unaided eye.\" This study comes as SpaceX's Starlink constellation continues to grow on a regular basis, with the number of current Starlink satellites in orbit having reached more than 5,600 with almost 6,000 having been launched by SpaceX as of this writing. As noted by both the study and Mallama, sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites causes issues with both aerial operations on Earth and astronomical observing, with Mallama also conducting research on satellite constellation brightness for Amazon, AST SpaceMobile, and Planet Labs. Therefore, with the number of satellites in orbit rapidly increasing due to constellations, what implications could this study have on managing satellite constellations in the future? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"One approach to reducing satellite brightness is to reflect sunlight into space rather than allowing it to scatter diffusively toward observers on the ground. That works very well most of the time. However, there are certain sun-satellite-observer geometries where it fails and observers see a mirror-like reflection of the sun.\" Mallam published a 2023 article with Sky & Telescope discussing how SpaceX's second-generation of Starlink satellites are fainter than their predecessors. Mallama credits his co-author, Richard Cole, as playing a \"crucial role\" in this study, noting how Cole \"predicted the extreme flares based on his numerical model of Starlink satellite brightness.\" How will sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites influence ground operations in the coming years and decades, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this activity? Only time will tell. More information: Anthony Mallama et al, Extreme Flaring of Starlink Satellites, arXiv (2024).

        "content": "MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as ''vital'' in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has ''its own large reserves of uranium.'' Putin, in turn, vowed to ''do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.'' If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "description": "KKR leave Andre Russell in splits with viral BPL interview",
        "content": "Listen to Story KKR all-rounder Andre Russell was left in laughter as the franchise's media team recreated his viral interview after the side's triumph in the Indian Premier Leguae (IPL) 2024 Final over SRH on May 26. After marking an emphatic victory over the Pat Cummins-led SRH, KKR became the second-most successful franchise in the history of the IPL by clinching their third-ever title. During an interaction with the KKR media team, Russell was asked the viral question back from his Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side, Duronto Dhaka's triumph in the 2023 season -\" Final match your perform what happening?\". The video became an instant hit amongst cricket fans around the world in no time. In a video uploaded by KKR's social media handles, the side's media personnel went around the team's stars like Sunil Narine and Russel about their experience of winning the IPL 2024 title. At the end of the video, the two were asked the viral question, which left them comically surprised. In the video from BPL 2023, Russell was left troubled about understanding the question from the interviewer, and that ultimately went on to become a widely used meme all over social media.

However, this was a first IPL final for the 36-year-old, after having missed out on the IPL 2014 final for his side due to an injury. In their IPL 2024 campaign, Russell has often played a pivotal role with both the bat and the ball for KKR and helping them clinch the title. A post shared by Kolkata Knight Riders (@kkriders) A post shared by IPL (@iplt20) Batting usually at number 6 or 7 for KKR, Russell showcased his trademark explosiveness with the bat and scored 222 runs in his 15 appearances throughout IPL 2024. With the ball, Russell had a brilliant season which saw him pick 19 wickets across the season.",

        "description": "Like most people, you may not have given the shape of the soda can a second thought. It turns out there's advanced engineering behind this design.",
        "content": "When it comes to beverage fun facts, perhaps you're familiar with , but do you know why it comes in cylindrical cans? Determining how the packaging was designed for a product is something most consumers probably don't deeply consider. After all, most people who enjoy soda today have never experienced a world in which this package wasn't the primary option (an outcome perhaps in part thanks to ). The soda can's development was in part inspired by why other shapes weren't up for the job. The two other main options — spheres and cuboids (or circles and squares, from a 2D perspective) — each had enough downsides that they were ruled out. Enter the cylinder, which had some of the same strengths as the other two options, along with it's own upsides. For those engineers ideating on how to best sell and serve soda, there seems to have been an evaluation of those three main entries, and understanding how they arrived at the iconic can shape is a little bit of an engineering Goldilocks tale. Considerations and contenders There are many considerations when creating food packaging. From preservation of quality, to convenience (both for producer and consumer), economics of transportation, ease of sale, and of course, aesthetics. The considerations for soda also include the pressure of carbonation (which is different from, say, juice or water). The sphere had some benefits in terms of even distribution of pressure, and a lot less susceptibility to damage thanks to the fact that there were no corners or edges. It also used the least amount of material, which would be good news for the bottom line (making them also lighter and less expensive to transport). The bad news? Well, for one thing, a sphere of liquid isn't going to sit still on the table when you set it down, or stack up beautifully for a grocery store display. Additionally, when filling a shipping box with balls, there's an awful lot of wasted space in between (almost a full 1⁄4 of the box's volume). On the opposite end of the spectrum, consider the cuboid, which can't be beat in terms of packaging (there is literally zero wasted space, as they can stack neatly like building blocks). They're also not going anywhere when you set them down on a table or a store shelf, because the bottom is conveniently flat and stable. Unfortunately, corners, protrusions, and edges are subject to vulnerability. So, another no-go. The clear winner The cylinder? Now that was just right for soda — a hybrid model between the sphere and the cuboid. It reached a happy medium in terms of its ability to be stacked and also packed more efficiently (only about 10% of a shipping package of cylinders will be empty), and lacked the severe vulnerability of the edgy cuboid. Another consideration was ease of production, and in that respect, the cylinder was a clear winner in its quick and innovative process. Of course, there are so many additional awe-inspiring decisions that make the can we know today. It needed a lining that can stand up to carbonic acid (which could corrode the inside walls), the pull-tab that makes it simple for us to open without an extra tool, and the seam that keeps the whole thing stitched together. Soda can engineers didn't rest on their laurels either, they've continued to innovate, improve, and streamline (which is part of ) as technology has become available. The vessel as we know it today is the result of evaluation and compromise, ingenuity and evolution.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "Fans accuse THAT security guard at Cannes Film Festival of chasing '15 minutes of fame' after clashing with Kelly Rowland, Yoona and Massiel Taveras By Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Codie Bullen For Mailonline Published: 18:41 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:56 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail 11 shares 21 View comments Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France , has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women.' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over how the minder was seemingly only 'aggressive with women of color.' Another wrote: 'This lady is a STRAIGHT up HATER... first Kelly Rowland and NOW Massiel Taveras........ she needs to be TERMINATED.' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote. 'It's seems such a coincidence that it is always the same security guard that is giving the same issue. The job does not require them to become the news unless they are doing on purpose... #15Secondsoffame.' Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France, has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet (seen last week in a heated discussion with singer Kelly Ro)wland 'Like seriously why is @Festival_Cannes allowing their crazy security guards to tackle & harass guests like this?' a fourth asked. 'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet.' A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event.' 'This Cannes film festival security guard needs a pay raise asap,' one X user suggested. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos. The K-pop star-turned-actress, 33, was preparing to pose for pictures on the iconic red stairs when she was stopped by the security guard. The incident came just days after the same guard was scolded by Rowland on the red carpet, which the Destiny's Child implied was due to racism while the staffer's colleagues insisted she was 'only doing her job.' Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over seemingly being 'aggressive with women of color' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote.

'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet' Another shared a meme of a priest getting tackled, which they compared to the security guard blocking celebrities from posing Some pointed out that the guard only seemed to be acting 'aggressive with women of color' 'Needs to be fire,' another tweeted A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event' Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before. The Dominican actress was on the red carpet on Saturday afternoon preparing to unfurl a huge gown with a depiction of Jesus on it, but appeared surprised to be stopped by the security guard. Footage of the spat showed Taveras defy instructions and throw the train of her dress down the stairs, before the situation escalated to the actress shoving the female security guard as she walked into the event. In the video of Taveras' confrontation, the actress seemed to plan to unravel her huge train down the steps, but was quickly stopped by the female security guard sticking out her arm. As other staffers helped lay out the dress while Taveras waved to fans, she grew angry as the security guard kept her arm out in front of her posing. The two exchanged a few words on the red carpet as staff pulled the train up the stairs, before Taveras took the end of the dress from another guard and threw it to the floor in frustration. The female security guard kept her arm close to Taveras as she escorted her up the stairs, although it is unclear what the reason was for the guard to tail her so closely. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs When she reached the top of the stairs, Taveras - who was previously crowned Miss Dominican Republic and competed at Miss Universe - struggled to unfurl the train of her dress. This led her to berate the security guard when she tried to step in, throwing her arms up in frustration. After the dress finally disentangled, Taveras waved to her fans - but the female security guard kept her arm across the actress, and appeared to jostle her towards the entrance. That move sparked an angry reaction from Taveras as she shoved the security guard away from her, before sticking up her finger and scowling at her. It is unclear why Taveras was confronted by the security guard, three days after the staffer also raised eyebrows with her spat with Rowland. The singer expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted. She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' However, colleagues of the security guard at the center of the Cannes spotlight insisted to DailyMail.com that she was acting appropriately and was 'only doing her job.' 'She was an usher working under a lot of pressure to keep people on the carpet moving, so as to stop crowds building up,' said a Festival staff veteran, who has been working in the resort every May for 20 years. 'There was no pushing or shoving, or scolding,' he said. 'Security and safety are the priorities, along with keeping to strict timetables set according to contracts – even the celebrities have to stick to the rules. 'Lots of ushers are involved, and they always act professionally and with politeness. 'In this case, the usher was certainly only doing her job – she didn't do anything wrong.' Rowland expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' The usher has not been publicly identified, but she is known to be a local Frenchwoman on a short term contract with the week-long Festival. The source added: 'Suggestions of racism are just ridiculous – visitors, and indeed staff at Cannes come from all kinds of backgrounds, and none are discriminated against.' After footage of Rowland berating the staffer went viral, a lip-reading expert revealed what Kelly really said during the heated interaction with the French woman. Jacqui Press told MailOnline that after the security guard appeared to step on her dress, she apologized and Kelly said: 'It's OK.' However, the security guard then said something else, causing Kelly's change in mood, as she responded: 'Don't talk to me like that.' As the security guard continued to usher her up the stairs, Kelly turned around and repeated the phrase several times.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. ''Bill Walton,'' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, ''was truly one of a kind.'' Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. ''One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,'' Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: ''Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. ''It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. ''As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.'' Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. ''In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,'' Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. ''Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.'' The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a ''Deadhead.'' And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the ''Conference of Champions'' and loved it all the way to the end. ''It doesn't get any better than this,'' he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. ''What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,'' Silver said. ''He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.'' Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "FURTHER CUTS TO interest rates and energy prices are on the cards, according to Finance Minister Michael McGrath. Speaking to reporters at the National Economic Dialogue in Dublin Castle today, the minister said Ireland’s inflation rate is one of the lowest in the Euro area, running at around 2%. “We are likely to be at a turning point in the interest rate cycle. We expect further energy price reductions to be passed through the wholesale level to the retail level. We will see an improvement in living standards for many people. “The vast majority of households in Ireland will see gains in real terms across 2024. So that’s very positive,” he said. His comments come as the chief economist of the European Central Bank Philip Lane has indicated that the ECB should be in a position to begin cutting interest rates from next week. McGrath said there is still a need to be careful in the decisions government makes over the next year, due to the “deep uncertainty” surrounding geopolitical tensions. Speaking about the budget this year, the minister said there will be measures to support households with the cost of living. He said there will be a social welfare package and income tax cuts. He said there should be a move away from one-off cost-of-living measures, given the fall in inflation, and a move towards permanent measures and permanent changes to taxation frameworks. While there has been speculation of the budget being brought forward, perhaps in time for an autumn election, McGrath said today that the budget will be at normal time in October. The minister said in the coming weeks he will bring a memorandum to the government to confirm the date of the budget, stating: “There are no plans to change the budget date from normal periods.”",

        "content": "If Russia attacks one of the NATO countries, this state will have to wait at least two weeks for its allies to come to the rescue. It will all depend on whether the country has a warning of a potential attack and whether its leaders dare to act before the attack. This was stated by the former commander of the US Army in Europe, retired General Ben Hodges in an interview with Romanian television. He criticized some Western leaders who do not want to take any action because of the risk of \"escalation.\" If they show courage, the two weeks could be significantly reduced. \"Assuming we didn't start moving in advance (of a potential attack – Ed.), Romania and all the other countries – Poland, Lithuania, all of them – would have to wait probably two weeks before additional forces arrive,\" Hodges said. At the same time, the American general noted that each country should understand that it would have to be one-on-one with the enemy for about two weeks. This time will be needed to organize the troops of NATO countries, as well as all ground forces in the country under attack. \"The air force will be able to arrive earlier, the naval forces of other countries – Turkey and Bulgaria – could also arrive a little faster,\" he said. As reported by OBOZ.UA, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană said that Russia currently has neither the intention nor the ability to attack any of the bloc's countries. However, Moscow is waging a hybrid war against the West. At the same time, NATO Military Committee Chairman Rob Bauer warned that civilians in the West should prepare for a possible conflict with Russia. He noted that the armed forces are already prepared in case of war. Only verified information on our Telegram channel OBOZ.UA and Viber . Do not fall for fakes!",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 In recent years, the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) market has emerged as a pivotal segment of the global travel and tourism industry. Two major events propelling this growth in China and the Middle East are the Riyadh Travel Fair (RTF) and ITB China. These events have become essential platforms for fostering business connections, showcasing destinations, and promoting the expansion of the MICE sector. Riyadh Travel Fair: Gateway to Middle East’s MICE Market The Riyadh Travel Fair, held annually in Saudi Arabia’s capital, has grown into one of the most significant travel and tourism events in the Middle East. The fair attracts thousands of visitors and exhibitors from across the globe, providing a comprehensive platform for the travel trade industry. For the MICE market, Riyadh Travel Fair offers unparalleled opportunities for networking, business development, and knowledge exchange. RTF’s significance lies in its ability to bring together stakeholders from various segments of the travel industry, including airlines, hospitality groups, travel agencies, and tourism boards. The fair’s focus on the MICE sector is evident through its dedicated pavilions and sessions that address the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in event management and corporate travel. One of the key aspects of Riyadh Travel Fair is its emphasis on showcasing Saudi Arabia as a prime MICE destination. The Saudi Arabian Kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative aims to diversify its economy by boosting tourism, and RTF plays a crucial role in this endeavor. By highlighting state-of-the-art convention centers, luxury hotels, and unique cultural experiences, Riyadh Travel Fair positions Saudi Arabia as a competitive choice for international conferences and exhibitions. ITB China: A Catalyst for China’s MICE Industry ITB China, held annually in Shanghai, is a leading travel trade fair dedicated to the Chinese travel market. It serves as a vital hub for international and domestic exhibitors to connect with Chinese buyers and establish fruitful partnerships. The event’s focus on the MICE sector is particularly noteworthy, as it provides a platform for stakeholders to explore new business opportunities and trends. China’s MICE market has experienced significant growth, driven by the country’s robust economic development and increasing demand for business travel. ITB China capitalizes on this trend by offering a comprehensive program that includes business matchmaking, educational forums, and networking events. These elements are designed to facilitate connections between Chinese and international MICE professionals, fostering collaboration and innovation. One of the standout features of ITB China is its Hosted Buyer Program, which brings high-caliber buyers from around the world to meet with exhibitors. This program ensures that participants have access to decision-makers and influencers in the MICE industry, enhancing the potential for successful business outcomes. Additionally, ITB China’s focus on technology and innovation provides attendees with insights into the latest tools and solutions for optimizing event management and enhancing attendee experiences. Synergizing Growth and Innovation Both the Riyadh Travel Fair and ITB China are instrumental in driving the growth of the MICE market in their respective regions. By providing platforms for networking, knowledge exchange, and business development, these events contribute to the expansion and diversification of the travel trade industry. In the Middle East, RTF supports Saudi Arabia’s vision of becoming a leading MICE destination, attracting international events and boosting tourism. Meanwhile, ITB China plays a crucial role in connecting Chinese MICE professionals with global partners, fostering innovation and growth in the sector. As the MICE market continues to evolve, the collaborative efforts and insights gained from events like RTF and ITB China will be essential in shaping the future of business travel and tourism in the Middle East and China.",

        "content": "The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in partnership with the Kwara State government, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of free Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine against cervical cancer among school children in the state. At the rollout of the HPV vaccine in Ilorin, the state capital, the executive director and chief executive officer of the NPHCDA, Dr. Muyi Aina, said that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. A total of 787 school children were vaccinated at the event. Aina, who was represented by Sheu Hassan, said that the HPV vaccine is a very important vaccine, adding that, “it prevents the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and causes more than 95 per cent of cases of cervical cancer.” He said that all eligible girls between the ages of 9-14 years across 193 wards in the 16 local government areas of Kwara State will be vaccinated against cervical cancer during the five-day programme. “I believe that together, we will achieve the goal of this exercise. At least 80% eligible girls aged 9 to 14 years will be reached during the five days intensification, after which the HPV vaccines will be accessed by our girls through routine immunization services in our PHC facilities. “Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. It is estimated that 604,000 cases with 342,000 deaths occurred globally in 2020, and an estimated 12,075 cases and 7,968 deaths were recorded in Nigeria,” he stated. The NPHCDA boss, who said that the HPV vaccine was free, safe, and effective, urged stakeholders to mobilise family members, friends, and communities to ensure that all eligible girls get vaccinated. “Let me thank and appreciate the Kwara State Government for its support in strengthening PHC in the state. I want to specially thank Her Excellency Professor Olufolake AbdulRazaq for her role in the fight against cervical cancer. “HPV vaccines with corresponding devices and operational funds have been provided to the states to support this exercise. I must thank his Excellency, the governor of Kwara state, for his regular release of counterparts’ funds to support PHC activities, including the HPV introduction. “Your support, that of the Governors Wives forum, wives of LGA chairmen, traditional/religious leaders, Civil Society Organizations, Women groups, media, and other relevant stakeholders remain paramount to the success of the HPVV introduction and other PHC activities. “The NPHCDA remains committed to collaborating with the sub-national levels to strengthen routine immunization and other PHC services for better health for all,” Aina added. In her remarks, the wife of the Kwara State governor, Ambassador Olufolake AbdulRazaq, assured of the efficacy of the vaccine, while she charged stakeholders to dispel negative rumours and misconception against the HPV vaccines. “Today’s event set the tone for an ambitious, inclusive strategy to accelerate eliminating cervical cancer as a public health concern. Elimination is within the reach of all hence we in Kwara are committed to towing this path to ensure that we seize the opportunities that are within our reach now, so that our girls will live free of this disease. “In complementing the efforts that culminated in incorporating the HPV vaccine into the National routine immunization schedule and today’s roll out however, I urge key stakeholders in respective communities to continue to amplify awareness and sensitization on benefits of presenting eligible children for the vaccine. “This no doubt will entail engagements with our communities, traditional and religious institutions to educate, inform, and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the HPV vaccine,” the Kwara State First Lady added.",

        "content": "North Korea launches rocket 'carrying spy satellite' By Claudia Aoraha For Dailymail.Com Published: 18:42 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:44 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail Advertisement Japan issued an alert telling its residents to take cover after North Korea launched a rocket allegedly carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night. The rocket launch came just hours after the country's announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center at 10:44pm on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan 's coast guard about its plans to launch 'a satellite rocket' during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. Kim Jong-Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.

        "content": "The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State in the 2023 election, Chief Timipre Sylva has expressed dissatisfaction with Monday’s Bayelsa Governorship Election Tribunal judgment and expressed his readiness to appeal the ruling. A statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Affairs, Julius Bokoru, said the Minister of State for Petroleum under former President Muhammadu Buhari immediately held a meeting with elders and stakeholders of the party after the judgement. Rising from the meeting, the former Governor of Bayelsa directed his legal team to immediately seek justice at the Court of Appeal. Prior to the judgement, Sylva had accused the tribunal of bias following alleged several infractions observed by his lawyers during the hearing of the case. He subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal demanding the dissolution of the panel and reconstitution of a new one. Sylva said, “We are not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal. But this is just a court of first instance and after meeting with the elders and critical stakeholders of our great party, the APC, we directed our legal team to seek justice for Bayelsa at the Supreme Court.” The governorship candidate assured the people of Bayelsa that the Court of Appeal would surely correct the travesty perpetrated by the tribunal. He declared that the liberation of Bayelsa was close and that “justice was inevitable for the traumatised people of the state,” appealing to them to remain positive, law-abiding and steadfast.",

        "content": "A NORTH Korean rocket carrying its second spy satellite reportedly exploded midair today in a dramatic setback for Kim Jong-un. Footage showed a red, orange and yellow fireball in the night sky soon after the launch that was strongly condemned by the pariah state's neighbours. North Korea's official state news agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket from its main space centre tonight. But it added that the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Japanese TV broadcast apparent footage of a missile exploding showing a huge fiery ball lighting up the sky. Earlier today, residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa were urged to take shelter inside buildings or underground premises as part of a missile alert. The public alerts were withdrawn after it became clear the rocket would not fly over the islands. North Korea had informed its neighbour of an imminent launch of a satellite rocket during a launch window from Monday through June 3. There was a warning of caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon. North Korea had been strongly urged to abandon the launch, which had been predicted by South Korea. South Korea's military later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite at 10:44pm local time. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. The UN bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. However, North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Last November, Kim sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to deal with what he calls US-led military threats. AFTER launching its first successful spy satellite in November, Kim Jong-un declared it a \"new era of space power The November launch drew new sanctions from the US and its allies over fears the satellites are a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. Western powers have slammed North Korea's satellite tests as a violation of the UN's Security Council resolutions, which prohibit the development of North Korea's missile programmes. The UN's ruling - passed with Russia's support - also bans any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology and aerospace. However, Kim has been hellbent on flaunting the rules and pursuing his space programme in a bid to counter what he calls Western military threats. How could the spy satellites be used? In February, US space experts said North Korea's first spy satellite, dubbed the Malligyong-1, was \"alive\" although its capabilities remain unknown. The satellites will likely be unable to provide the North with detailed intelligence but could be useful for spying on things such as troop movements, analysts say. However, North Korea is believed to be developing a larger rocket to launch a more capable satellite. Is Russia helping? After the success of the November launch - after two failed attempts - South Korea said Kim may have overcome technical hurdles with the help of Russia. Russia in September publicly pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites. Many experts expressed doubts, however, that Moscow could have provided game-changing assistance in such a short time. Afterwards, Kim revealed would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two embarrassing failed liftoffs . In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor US and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. Monday's launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It's highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China - its major ally and economic pipeline - is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region.",

        "content": "In preparation for the next phase of the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, former Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has named his Benin Republic team to face Super Eagles, PRIMANEWS Sports Extra reports. Nigeria face South Africa on June 7 at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo before heading to Abidjan’s Stade Felix Houphouet-Boigny three days later for a date with Rohr’s Benin Republic. The Eagles and the Squirrels are in Group C of the World Cup qualifiers and are set to face each other next month. Since taking over the Benin job in February 2023, Rohr has played 10 games, winning just one, drawing four, and losing five. He will however hope to turn the fortune of the team around when he faces his former team and to do that the Franco-German has named his 25-man squad. In the squad are 19 professionals playing at various clubs in Europe and six home-based players drawn from the local league. Nigeria have drawn their first two matches in the series against Zimbabwe and Lesotho, positioning them in third place, trailing behind the leaders Rwanda with four points and South Africa with three points. Acknowledging the qualities of the Eagles squad, Rohr said, “They are only two points behind the group leaders (Rwanda), and that is an advantage they can overturn in the next round. We cannot rule out a team with the quality of the Nigerian team. Every team in the group knows it.” The Eagles last qualified for the global football tournament in Russia in 2018 after they missed out on Qatar 2022 following a play-off defeat to eternal rivals Ghana. The squirrels are expected to leave Cotonou for Abidjan on Monday and train on the same pitch where they will face the Super Eagles. During his time in charge of the Eagles, which spanned five years, Rohr led the team through a total of 64 matches. He guided the Eagles to 35 victories, suffered 13 losses, and endured 16 drawn games. One of the highlight of his time in charge of the Eagles was a third-place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.",

        "description": "Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Carol Clark, Emory University Health authorities are working to gather information on the spread of the H5N1 virus, or bird flu, in U.S. dairy cows—the first confirmation of the virus in cattle. \"We have moved into new territory,\" says Thomas Gillespie, professor and chair of Emory University's Department of Environmental Sciences. The dairy cow infections are simply the latest twist in a global pattern: since 2022, bird flu has been infecting a wide variety of mammals. \"You can find this trend around the world, almost anywhere you look,\" Gillespie says. \"This virus has an extremely broad range of hosts that it is able to infect.\" Gillespie is a disease ecologist, studying how pathogens jump across species in the environment. He is a leader in the \"One Health\" approach—considering the deep connections between the health of people, domesticated animals, wildlife and ecosystems—to build pandemic control and prevention. The avian influenza cases in cows have been mild. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed two human cases connected to the outbreak—one in Texas and one in Michigan. Both cases were mild and involved people who worked on a dairy farm. The pasteurization process kills the H5N1 virus, and the CDC describes the current risk to the general public as \"low.\" The H5N1 virus is known as avian influenza, or bird flu, because birds are its natural reservoir. Wild, migrating birds can spread H5N1 globally. The current version has been circulating since 2020 and has infected a greater diversity of bird species than past lineages. The virus has been reported in birds in the United States since 2022. Poultry producers have culled millions of their animals to try to control the spread of the virus. It has long been known that mammals can become infected with H5N1 when they eat infected birds or are exposed to environments contaminated with the virus. What is unprecedented is the current scale and variety of mammals that have been infected. \"Most of these are likely dead-end cases, where a predator eats an infected bird and gets sick but doesn't spread the virus,\" Gillespie says. He adds, however, that recent die-offs of thousands of elephant seals, sea lions and fur seals in South America caused by bird flu raises concerns about the possibility of mammal-to-mammal transmission. \"Not enough surveillance is done in wildlife to know for sure how the virus is spreading,\" he says. H5N1 has also been reported in foxes, otters, lynx, polecats and badgers in Europe and in raccoon dogs and foxes in Japan. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recorded detections of H5N1 in 200 mammals in the United States since 2022, including a bottlenose dolphin , foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, coyotes, skunks, harbor and gray seals, opossums, squirrels, minks, otters and black and brown bears. Last December, a polar bear on Alaska's North Slope became the first of its species known to die of avian influenza. In 2023, the virus was also been detected for the first time in the Antarctic region—in birds, elephant seals and fur seals—raising fears for the health of the fragile ecosystem. \"Some of the species that are at risk for bird flu are already battling the stressors of climate change and loss of habitat,\" Gillespie says. And each time H5N1 infects a new animal host, it gives the virus a chance to mix with other flu strains and rearrange its genetic material. Accumulating such mutations can change the virus in ways that make it more easily transmissible and more deadly—including to humans. Pigs' immune systems share similarities with humans, making swine especially efficient mixing bowls for viruses that can affect humans. Gillespie cites deforestation and industrialized animal production as major drivers for the risk of pandemics as well as climate change. Forests in tropical regions are rapidly degrading due to cattle ranching and the clearing of land for agricultural crops such as soybeans—which are mainly used as feed for chickens and pigs on industrial farms. \"The resulting cheap meat that we buy does not reflect the true costs to the ecosystems that sustain us,\" Gillespie says. \"If we want to live sustainably, we need to cut down on the amount of animal products that we consume. That will be a win-win for human health and for planetary health.\" Provided by Emory University",

        "content": "As China’s economy continues to spiral downward, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has initiated a significant plan for the government to buy back unsold homes from developers and repurpose them as affordable housing. This measure is apparently aimed at stabilizing housing prices and mitigating the economic impact of falling real estate prices. Funding for this buyback is expected to come from long—or ultra-long-term government bonds. “On May 17, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng announced during a national video conference that local governments in cities with high inventories of new homes can purchase unsold properties at reasonable prices to stabilize housing prices. He stated that these properties would be converted into affordable housing. This announcement follows earlier hints from informed sources who revealed to the Chinese media that the details of this plan were still under discussion and could take several months to finalize. The urgency of the announcement in May is likely due to the poor performance of the property market in the first four months of the year, with sales falling by approximately 47 percent,” he said. According to Mr. Li, affordable housing in China was first introduced in 2007 but was not implemented for a long time. This is because local governments relied heavily on revenue from land sales and real estate taxes, making them reluctant to pursue policies that might undermine these income sources. It wasn’t until 2017 when the CCP leader Xi Jinping emphasized that “housing is for living, not for speculation,” that the policy began to take shape. By 2021, plans were in place to build hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units, but this was still a small fraction compared to the 18 million units sold that year. According to the new affordable housing policy, it focuses primarily on affordable rental housing. From 2021 to 2025, the plan is to build 8.7 million units of affordable rental housing nationwide, with rental units accounting for 80 percent of the total. This is in line with an earlier statement by Cao Jinbiao, director of the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ministry’s Housing Security Department, who noted that from 2021 to 2025, new affordable rental housing should account for 30 percent of the total new housing supply. In major cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, this proportion is expected to reach 40-45 percent or even higher. “China’s economy is deeply intertwined with its real estate sector, which accounts for approximately 30 percent of the country’s GDP. The decline of the real estate industry significantly impacts the overall economy. It even triggered a local government debt crisis,” she said. Ms. Guo went on to say that the CCP’s current measures aim to address these challenges in three main ways: “First, by purchasing houses from developers, the government provides developers with much-needed capital to alleviate financial strains and reduce corporate debt. This also allows buyers of pre-sold properties to receive their homes, easing social tensions that arise from undelivered housing projects. “Second, using purchased properties as collateral. The government can mortgage the bought-back properties to banks to secure loans, addressing the issue of banks having high deposits but low lending. This helps maintain bank profitability and reduces financial pressures. “Third, stabilizing home prices. The government aims to support property market prices through these buybacks, attempting to mitigate the decline in asset values. This is similar to major shareholders repurchasing stock to support stock prices, ultimately hoping to extract more funds from the market in the future.” She believes that while these measures have potential benefits for the economy, there are concerns about their effectiveness. The primary issues are the source of the large funds required for these buybacks and whether these measures can genuinely stabilize housing prices. “The key is the scale of the government buyback,” Ms. Guo said. “Currently, local governments are financially strained and heavily indebted. The central government has pledged an initial 300 billion yuan for this effort, with Suzhou alone requiring 25 billion yuan. This amount is clearly insufficient nationwide.” She calculated the cost of buying back the unsold homes on the market in detail. “China has 7.4 billion square meters of newly constructed housing awaiting sale and 6.7 billion square meters (72 billion square feet) under construction. In the first four months of this year, 2.9 billion square meters were sold. If the government aims to purchase 80 percent of the real estate market’s backlog over a few years at an average price of 9,420 yuan (about $1,300) per square meter, based on Q1 2024 prices, it would need 50 trillion yuan (about $6.9 trillion). This translates to 10 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) annually over five years.” Ms. Guo also cited China’s official financial figures to illustrate her point. “For 2024, the central government’s deficit is 3.34 trillion yuan (about $470 billion), with a local deficit of 720 billion yuan (about $101 billion), ultra-long-term special national bonds at 1 trillion yuan (about $140 billion), and new local government special bonds totaling 3.9 trillion yuan (about $548 billion). The broad money deficit stands at 8.96 trillion yuan (about $1.2 trillion). The funds required for the buyback far exceed the government’s annual deficit. In China, every piece of land is owned by the state, but a so-called “homeowner” has a “land use right” that allows him or her to use the land for 70 years. “This is a premeditated plan by the CCP,” Mr. Hu commented. “When the 70-year lease expires, the property will revert to state ownership, and the resident will be transformed from an owner to a tenant paying rent to the government.” He believes that Xi’s emergence and the current collapse of the real estate sector are not coincidences, as they are the inevitable fate of a communist system.",

        "content": "Travelers move through Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport ahead of Memorial Day on Friday in Atlanta. Mike Stewart/Associated Press ATLANTA — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the Transportation Security Agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airline crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday – 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost.

        "description": "The National Student Financial Aid Scheme plans to begin paying allowances directly into university students’ bank accounts by September as it heads to court to cancel contracts with irregularly appointed direct payment service providers.",
        "content": "The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) plans to begin paying allowances directly into university students’ bank accounts by September as it heads to court to cancel contracts with irregularly appointed direct payment service providers. NSFAS held its first media briefing on Monday since the appointment of administrator Freeman Nomvalo in April by higher education minister Blade Nzimande. Since then, the financial aid scheme has announced a new payment system for technical vocational education and training (TVET) college students to be rolled out at the end of May, due to students not receiving their funds through the appointed service providers. “As it is the end of May, I’m pleased to announce that the payments that are currently being made are directly into students' bank accounts as announced on April 26. We have requested all TVET students who do not have bank accounts to open bank accounts with banks of their choice to avoid delays in the payment of their allowances,” Nomvalo said. NSFAS filed an application to the courts on Friday to terminate its contracts with four payment service providers. This is part of implementing the Werksmans Attorneys report which was commissioned by NSFAS to identify areas needing improvement concerning procurement services and management. The probe followed allegations of irregularities related to the appointment of direct payment service providers, with former NSFAS CEO Andile Nongogo accused of a conflict of interest in awarding the contracts. The report found that Nongogo actively participated in the presentation of proposals by service providers to the bid evaluation committee, which was a violation of NSFAS’ public procurement process. It also revealed that there appeared to be a conflict of interest in the appointment of the four service providers — Ezaga Holdings, Coinvest Africa, Norraco Corporation and Tenet Technologies. Nomvalo said they worked with the Special Investigating Unit in deciding to terminate the contracts. “I am happy to announce that the process to terminate these contracts has commenced with the filing of the necessary court papers on May 24. In the termination of these contracts, NSFAS collaborated with the SIU. Through our lawyers, we have communicated this decision to all the direct payment service providers [on Monday]. Furthermore, we have made significant progress in subjecting all implicated NSFAS employees in the report to appropriate disciplinary action. Where appropriate, we will also consider laying criminal charges,” he said. In the meantime, university students will continue to receive their allowances through the university, as NSFAS had requested the institutions to assist until the end of July. Nomvalo said the rollout was dependent on whether the transition would cause disruptions to academic time, which was a concern raised by universities when he met them on Friday. “We intend to be ready by the end of July, but there may be issues that come into play at that time, which is why we initially said September. What will inform the rollout process in September is the smooth transition that avoids further problems in institutions ... What will guide us is to what extent is the introduction of a new mechanism likely to cause disruptions. If it does cause disruption, we will find ways to make sure it is implemented smoothly.” TimesLIVE",

        "content": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered hundreds of new worlds, with TESS planet candidates now outnumbering the total number of confirmed planets from Kepler. Owing to differences in survey design, TESS continues to provide planets that are better suited for subsequent follow-up studies, including mass measurement through radial velocity (RV) observations, compared to Kepler targets. In this work, we present the TESS-Keck Survey’s (TKS) Mass Catalog: a uniform analysis of all TKS RV survey data which has resulted in mass constraints for 126 planets and candidate signals. This includes 58 mass measurements that have reached ≥5σ precision. We confirm or validate 32 new planets from the TESS mission either by significant mass measurement (15) or statistical validation (17), and we find no evidence of likely false positives among our entire sample. This work also serves as a data release for all previously unpublished TKS survey data, including 9,204 RV measurements and associated activity indicators over our three year survey. We took the opportunity to assess the performance of our survey, and found that we achieved many of our goals including measuring the mass of 38 small (<4R⊕) planets, nearly achieving the TESS mission’s basic science requirement. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the Automated Planet Finder (APF) as survey support and observed meaningful constraints on system parameters due to its more uniform phase coverage. Finally, we compared our measured masses to those predicted by commonly used mass-radius relations and investigated evidence of systematic bias. Alex S. Polanski, Jack Lubin, Corey beard, Jospeh M.

        "content": "Ellie Leach has named her 'dream' contestant for Strictly Come Dancing, nearly six months on from her own win on the show and after a wealth of rumours on who will be on the line-up this year. Not long after her exit from ITV soap Coronation Street, Ellie took to the Strictly dancefloor for the first time in September and her partnership with pro dancer Vito Coppola quickly made the couple a force to be reckoned with, as the scores just got better and better in the run up to the BBC final. And, while things didn't quite go plan for them in the finale, with a lift going wrong right at the end of their Show Dance, Ellie and Vito ended up as champions, topping the public vote when it mattered most. A month after their victory in the ballroom, Ellie and Vito joined many of their co-stars on the Strictly live tour and, now Ellie is taking on a very different role on stages across the country, as she joins the cast of Cluedo 2 , as Miss Scarlet. And, as the production arrives in Newcastle for a run at the Theatre Royal , Ellie has backed one of the most rumoured stars this time round to follow in her footsteps and do Strictly.

Speaking to ChronicleLive, she said: \"Hannah Waddingham would be amazing. And I'd just say to anyone who does end up doing Strictly this year to enjoy every second of being on the show and the whole experience. It completely changed my life!\"",

        "content": "Iran is continuing to enrich uranium to near weapons grade after UN talks stalled, nuclear watchdog warns Iran's total enriched uranium stockpile is estimated at 13,671.5 pounds By Miriam Kuepper Published: 13:01 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:43 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 9 View comments Iran is continuing to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade after UN talks have stalled, the UN's nuclear watchdog has warned. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran's estimated stockpile of enriched uranium had reached more than 30 times the limit set out in the 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers. According to a confidential IAEA report, the country's total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 13,671.5 pounds as of May 11, up by 1,489.9 pounds from the last quarterly report in February. About 313.2 pounds of the uranium is enriched up to 60 per cent - an increase of 45.4 pounds. Uranium enriched at 60 per cent purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. It comes as talks aimed at improving its cooperation with the IAEA and monitoring by the watchdog in Iran are stalled, a second confidential report has revealed. In this picture released by the Iranian Defense Ministry on Thursday, May 25, 2023, Khorramshahr-4 missile is launched at an undisclosed location, Iran Head of Iran's atomic energy department Mohammad Eslami waves to media at the conclusion of his joint press conference with International Atomic Energy Organization, IAEA, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, left, after their meeting in the central city of Isfahan, Iran, on May 7, 2024 'There has been no progress in the past year towards implementing the Joint Statement of 4 March 2023,' it stated. 'The Director General reiterates to the new government of Iran his call for, and disposition to continue with, the high-level dialogue and ensuing technical exchanges commenced ... on 6-7 May 2024,' it added. Read More Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei prays over Ebrahim Raisi's coffin as huge crowds of mourners throng the streets of Tehran for President's funeral days after devastating helicopter crash In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran 'to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.' The IAEA said that the deaths of Iran's President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused the pause in the UN nuclear watchdog's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran 'be continued in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon\".' Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make 'several' nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran's centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. The IAEA said that the deaths of Iran's President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused the pause in the UN nuclear watchdog's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation (pictured: the memorial at the Iranian Embassy in Moscow, Russia, Monday, May 20, 2024) The Iranian uranium enrichment facility at Fordow near Qom, in northern Iran Iran trials a medium-range surface-to-surface missile, the Sejil-2, in northeastern Iran in 2009. Then-President Ahmadinejad said Iran was capable of sending any aggressor 'to hell'. Iran and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic's rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Read More EXCLUSIVE The terrifying arsenal at Iran's disposal: Islamic Republic could disable Israel with EMPs and may have stockpile of dirty bombs, experts warn after Tehran bragged it will unleash 'weapons never used before' if attacked In December last year, the UK government warned that Iran's stockpiles 'are unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme', denouncing the 'deplorable state' of its commitments to a 2015 deal in which Tehran agreed to slash stockpiles and enrich only to 3.67 per cent. According to the UK government, 'Iran has continued to violate the terms of the JCPOA agreement' since May 2019. The JCPOA refers to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement made between Iran, the EU and the P5+1 in 2015 to limit Iran's enrichment programme. Iran agreed to cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98 per cent, limit its enrichment activities and convert facilities to avoid further risk of nuclear proliferation. By 2018, the IAEA was reporting that Iran was committing to its agreement after installing surveillance across plants. But two years later, Iran said it would no longer abide by the terms of the deal but would continue to work with the IAEA, leaving the door open for a revised agreement. Iran has been developing nuclear technology since 1957, backed at first by the American ' Atoms for Peace ' programme which provided adopters with nuclear technology in return for a commitment to only using it for civilian purposes.

        "content": "As cyclone ‘Remal’ over Coastal Bangladesh and adjoining Coastal West Bengal moved nearly northwards, with a speed of 15 kmph during past 06 hours, Kolkata Police said that many areas of the city have been hard-hit by the severe cyclonic storm. Taking to X, Kolkata police shared, “Many areas of the city have been hard-hit by Cyclone Remal. Our Disaster Management Group personnel and personnel of different police stations have been making efforts all night to remove numerous trees uprooted in the storm to keep traffic moving.” Trees were uprooted in many parts of Kolkata. The city witnessed downpour with severe waterlogging following the landfall on Sunday over the adjacent coasts of West Bengal and Bangladesh between Sagar Island and Khepupara, near the southwest of Mongla in the neighbouring country. Heavy rain and gusty winds lashed several parts of West Bengal on Monday. The severe cyclonic storm ‘Remal’ has weakened since making landfall last night and is expected to downgrade into a deep depression by this evening, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) announced on Monday. The NDRF made the announcement based on the latest update from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). “The current information that we have from the IMD is that the severe cyclonic storm has now transformed into a cyclonic storm. The wind speed, which was earlier about 110 to 120 km/hr during landfall, now has come down to 60 to 70 km/hr,” NDRF Deputy Inspector General Mohsen Shahedi told ANI when asked about the status of ‘Remal’ after its landfall. Pointing out the downfall in the intensity of the cyclone, Shahedi said “This is a big relief and it is expected that by evening today, this will further change into a deep depression.” Questioned about the loss of lives and damage to properties due to the cyclone, the NDRF officer said: “From the information that we have, one death has taken place in Kolkata due to wall collapse. Restoration work is in progress. NDRF teams are deployed, 14 teams are deployed in major affected areas in the state and six SDRF teams are also deployed to assist... Apart from 14 teams in West Bengal, we have one team in Tripura just as a precautionary measure.” (ANI)",

        "content": "Haiden Deegan swept the motos at Fox Raceway in Pala, California, to score his third Pro Motocross National victory but . The finishing order was under review after Deegan rode off track late in Moto 2, causing officials to deliberate whether he slowed sufficiently while off course. They eventually decided in Deegan’s favor, and he heads to Rancho Cordova, California, for the Hangtown Classic with the red plate. A penalty for Deegan would have given Levi Kitchen the overall win. He finished second in both motos, but had Deegan been demoted one position, Kitchen would have had the tiebreaking better Moto 2 result. Kitchen led the most laps in Moto 1 until he was forced to slow momentarily to remove a course marker stuck in his boot. Kitchen now holds the lead in the SuperMotocross standings by 21 points. Fresh off his Supercross 250 East championship, Tom Vialle finished fourth in Moto 1 and third in Moto 2 to take the final position on the podium. He ended the 2023 season with a podium in the Ironman Nationals in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and picked up where he left off. Chance Hymas tied Vialle in points at Fox Raceway but was awarded fourth via the tiebreaker after finishing third in the first race and fourth in Moto 2. This is Hymas’ best Pro Motocross overall result, bettering his fifth-place finish last year in Thunder Valley. Jalek Swoll rounded out the top five in fifth after finishing sixth in Moto 1 and fifth in Moto 2. Swoll was in contention for the overall podium late in the race before Vialle and Hymas overtook him. Triumph’s quest for that elusive podium will continue for at least one more round. Swoll was not alone this round, however. After being denied the chance to ride in the 250 divisional Supercross championship, Joey Savatgy finished fifth in Moto 1 but ran crashed early in the second race to finish outside the top 10. His 5-13 put him ninth in the overall standings. . Here is the finishing order of Round 1 in Pala: 1. Haiden Deegan (1 - 1) 2. Levi Kitchen (2 - 2) 3. Tom Vialle (4 - 3) 4. Chance Hymas (3 - 4) 5. Jalek Swoll (6 - 5) 6. Jo Shimoda (8 - 6) 7. Nate Thrasher (11 - 7) 8. Pierce Brown (10 - 8) 9. Joseph Savatgy (5 - 13) 10. Ryder DiFrancesco (9 - 12) 11. Julien Beaumer (13 - 9) 12.

        "content": "First, it was Toys “R” Us. Then, Bed Bath & Beyond. Now, perhaps the most personally painful demise of a legendary franchise that helped to shape my psyche (and my penchant for complimentary appetizers), our local Red Lobster, along with over 90 other locations nationwide, recently bit the dust, or the biscuit – as it were. I guess we all saw it coming in the carnage of crippled restaurant chains that COVID-19 left in its wake. Red Lobster was never quite the same haven of succulent, mass-produced seafood after the pandemic. In particular, they inexplicably excised their scrumptious seafood gumbo from the menu – one of the main reasons I loved the place, and the only reason my eldest and most expensive daughter ever wanted to go. Granted, the carpet was dingy, the nautical decor was corny, and the lobster tanks invoked a sort of morbid fascination that made us all wish they’d take those rubber bands off the lobsters’ claws and let them have a battle royale to entertain us while we waited seemingly forever for our table. But still we went, if for no other reason than those indescribably delicious Cheddar Bay Biscuits, the presentation of which by our server invoked a kind of joy comparable only to the delivery of one’s firstborn child. Well, maybe not that much joy . . . but almost. Speaking of joy, in the late summer after my senior year of high school, when I had finally learned to apply the perfect combination of Right Guard deodorant and Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne, I took my future wife to Red Lobster one Sunday after church for our first real date. For an eighteen-year-old aspiring stud-muffin on a city-pool-lifeguard salary, Red Lobster was a big deal, and I thought she’d be especially impressed by the big brass lobster claw door handles. I know I was. It was there, gazing at each other across elegant entrees of fries and popcorn shrimp, that we found true love among the crustaceans. After we had children, we began a tradition of visiting Red Lobster after the evening Christmas Eve service at church since it was usually one of the very few restaurants open and we weren’t in the mood for pancakes – even international ones. I always requested kid’s menus for our daughters – even when they were teenagers – so that we could guess at the silly trivia games, play tic-tac-toe, and take turns embarrassing my wife by inserting crayons in various facial orifices – usually right when the server showed up. Besides, the food at Red Lobster just tasted good. I know there are seafood snobs out there who scoffed at what were undoubtedly pre-cooked, frozen menu items that required little more than a boiling bag, a deep fryer or an industrial microwave, but in East Texas, it was the next best thing to a mess of fried crappie if you asked me, and I’ll miss it. So, thanks for the memories, the Key lime pie with raspberry drizzle and those unlimited biscuits of gold, Red Lobster. You’ll always hold a special place in my heart – and my digestive system.

        "description": "Walton, who starred at UCLA and was a star in basketball broadcast died of cancer.",
        "content": "Bill Walton celebrates after the Celtics won the Eastern Conference finals in May 1986. Walton, who starred for UCLA and later played for NBA champions in Portland and Boston before becoming a broadcasting star, died at 71. Steve Pyle/Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career – disrupted by chronic foot injuries – lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,’ ” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA Coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Success.

        "content": "FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A passenger on a flight to Fresno was confirmed to be traveling with measles, according to LA County health officials. The traveler was United Flight 5591, which left Los Angeles at 8 pm on Sunday, May 19, and landed in Fresno at 9 pm. Their passenger who had measles, initially started their trip in Munich, Germany, and connected at LAX. Anyone who was assigned seats near that passenger on the flights will be notified by health officials. Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease that can cause severe sickness, especially in young children. The viral infection spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. Measles symptoms don't appear until 10 to 14 days after exposure. They include cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, sore throat, fever, and a red, blotchy skin rash. Measles is easily preventable by a vaccine. Health officials encourage everyone to confirm their measles vaccination status with their healthcare provider.",

        "content": "Early this year, Microsoft announced the roll out of the new Sticky Notes experience for Microsoft 365 Insiders. Today, Microsoft announced that this new Sticky Notes experience is now rolling out to all Windows users worldwide. The new Sticky Notes app integrates with OneNote, allowing users to access notes directly from the OneNote app on Windows. Also, this eliminates the need for a separate Sticky Notes app to offer an unified note-taking experience. The new app allows users to quickly create notes or take screenshots with a single click. Additionally, the app automatically captures the source information of the app window where the note is taken, making it easier to reference later. Users can access the new Sticky Notes app through the Windows Start menu, pin it to the taskbar for quick access, or use the keyboard shortcut Win + Alt + S for an even faster launch. You can also access the Sticky Notes via OneNote Android and iOS mobile apps. The new Sticky Notes experience is available to users running Windows 10 Version 1903 (SDK 18362) or later, and have OneNote for Windows Version 2402 (Build 17328.20000) or later.",

The problem in Crosby, on the outskirts of Scunthorpe, had become so bad that the local Tory MP spoke out to slam the 'reckless behaviour' of fly-tippers 'ruining our area.' The major clearing operation removed all rubbish mainly from alleyways – known locally as tenfoots - that had become ugly dumping grounds. They collected eight tonnes of 'bulky items' including 60 mattresses, 25 sofas and 40 items of white goods. Nine tonnes of 'smaller items' such as carpets, tables, wardrobes and rubble. There was 12 tonnes of general waste and five tonnes of swept up rubbish such as litter and glass. BEFORE: The major clearing operation removed all rubbish mainly from alleyways – known locally as tenfoots - that had become ugly dumping grounds BEFORE: Council workers collected eight tonnes of 'bulky items' including 60 mattresses, 25 sofas and 40 items of white goods North-East Lincolnshire Council pulled in staff from several departments and it took 196 working hours over two-days to clear Crosby's rubbish-strewn streets. CCTV is now being installed in a bid to catch the dumpers in action and stop other anti-social behaviour to prevent the blight returning. Environmental Health officers have also collected evidence from the clear up that may be used to prosecute fly-tippers responsible. Councillor Rob Waltham, leader of North Lincolnshire Council, said: 'Residents have told us of their concern over rubbish in the tenfoots and I am pleased we have been able to address these concerns. 'It is only a minority of people who insist on making such a disgusting mess and sadly some of these are the residents themselves. 'This massive clean-up will benefit the rest of the community who have to suffer other people's selfishness. 'It also means we can now start tackling the dumpers in earnest. Anyone who has been blighting our streets with rubbish can expect a knock on the door or a fine in the post. AFTER: Environmental Health officers have collected evidence from the clear up that may be used to prosecute fly-tippers responsible 'We are also considering introducing a Selective Licensing scheme in this area which will target poor landlords and poor tenants.' Fines for littering are £200, reduced to £100 if paid within 14 days, with a maximum of £2,500. Fly-tippers can be fined £1,000, reduced to £700 if paid within 14 days, with an unlimited maximum and also a risk of imprisonment. In January Scunthorpe's Tory MP Holly Mumby-Croft wrote a blog stating that the problem in Crosby was being caused by the 'reckless behaviour of some individuals.' AFTER: CCTV is now being installed in a bid to catch the dumpers in action and stop other anti-social behaviour to prevent the blight returning She added: 'Remember, this is everyone's problem. Where practical, talk to your neighbours, educate them about the impacts of fly-tipping, and encourage them to dispose of their waste appropriately. 'Quite frankly, I am sick to the back teeth of individuals ruining our area and costing us as council taxpayers to clean up their mess and I know many locally feel the same. Together, we can make a difference.'

        "content": "The is a powerful, big-screen tablet that's built for media, and it's currently $50 off the regular price on Amazon for $399. Samsung's latest Galaxy tablets come in two sizes, the for $399, and the for $549. If you have your heart set on a big tablet for watching movies and multitasking on the go and want to keep your spending in check, the Tab S9 FE+ is a solid choice. Keep in mind that you may experience the usual Android tablet quirks, such as outstretched apps and the occasional slow-down. The world of budget-friendly continues to grow as more companies try to appeal to those who don't feel like spending $1,000+ on a nice Netflix machine. Samsung is once again trying to make something happen in the upper mid-range sector with the Galaxy Tab S9 FE series, which consists of the and the . I've been reviewing the latter, which starts at $549, and... it's pretty good! I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's the greatest tablet since sliced bread. While it marks the return of Samsung's Galaxy Tab FE line after a hiatus in 2022, the company's mid-range tablets haven't changed all that much, save for a few tweaks here and there to bring them up to 2024 standards. The S9 FE+ is a prime example of that, but despite it being a boring update, it's still a great option if you're after a big screen with long battery life. The screen is really what makes the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. Samsung includes a 12.4-inch 16:10 IPS LCD that, to my eye, looks about as close as you can get to OLED without actually making the leap to OLED. Content looks pin-sharp thanks to the 2560 x 1600 resolution, while colors are vibrant and contrast is surprisingly adequate. I've enjoyed doing just about everything on this tablet, from watching movies to reading articles. It all looks superb, which is to be expected from a tablet from Samsung. Is it as beautiful as a straight-up OLED panel? No, not really. It doesn't help that there's a gray tint whenever something super dark shows up on the screen (such as nighttime in a movie), but for this price, it's forgivable. The screen sits on the front of an aluminum chassis that Samsung offers in four different colors: Silver, Gray, Lavender, and Mint (the one I got -- and yeah, it's definitely the best one). There's no shortage of similarities between it and the other members of the Galaxy Tab series, with its flat sides, circular speaker grilles, and antenna stripes. This also makes it look a lot like Apple's , which you cannot unsee the moment you set them next to each other. While the Tab S9 FE is not the most comfortable tablet to hold for long periods of time (no tablet with flat edges is), it's at least thin and light enough that you don't grow tired. After a while, it just tends to dig into your hand, which isn't great. But then again, that's with most modern tablets these days. At least the bezels are thick enough so you have somewhere to put your thumbs. Under the hood, Samsung packs in its Exynos 1380 processor, a mid-range chipset that isn't positioned to take on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2s and Apple M1s of the world. Instead, it's a fine processor for the Galaxy Tab S9 FE+, with performance that's generally reliable during my testing. Apps and games respond in a timely manner, with only a few slowdowns whenever I switch between apps rapidly. There's 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage in my unit, which is perfectly fine for most consumers. If you want more, there's a that's $100 extra, which will give you a bit more headroom that can come in handy if you're a serious tablet multitasker. The device comes with Samsung's One UI 5.1 on top of Android 13, and it's a fine operating system. The Tab S9 FE+ dons the usual One UI aesthetic and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to features and settings, including an array of multitasking features like split-screen, multi-window, and even DeX, which gives you a desktop-like interface for getting work done. That feature is best paired with a keyboard and mouse, which Samsung is happy to sell you in the form of the $229 Book Cover Keyboard. I didn't get it to review, but I bet it's nice when you're in DeX mode. Of course, this is Android on a tablet, so you'll have to deal with all the weird ways apps open and scale on the display. I'll admit, the app support situation isn't as bad as it was , thanks to Google pressuring more developers to optimize their apps for larger devices. Still, it's not perfect, and common apps like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Slack will either not stretch to fill the display or stretch too widely and leave you with a bunch of white space. This isn't Samsung's fault, by the way -- it's a larger problem with Android, which I feel obligated to mention whenever I review an Android tablet. Oh, there's one more software-esque feature I have to mention: drawing. The Tab S9 FE+ comes with an S Pen that magnetically attaches to the back to recharge. You can write notes, sign documents, create drawings, sketch, and more with solid accuracy and responsiveness. Samsung has been doing the S Pen thing for a while now, and it's perfected its technique. Battery life has been really good on the Tab S9 FE+, which is nice to see. There's a 10,090mAh battery inside that can last two to three days on a full charge with my light use. If you take it on a plane with you, you can easily watch two movies, play some games, and read an ebook before it dies. Standby is also surprisingly great; I left this tablet unattended all night at 100%, and it only dropped to 96 percent by the next morning. It's reminiscent of the kind of endurance you can get from an . ZDNET's buying advice If you're considering picking up the , I would recommend considering exactly what you need from your next tablet. If you're after a big screen and long battery life, this is the one for you. But if you'd be okay with something a little smaller or serves as a second device when you aren't using it, the is always a great option. It comes with a smaller 10.2-inch screen and a Tensor G2 processor, and it bundles a speaker dock in the box that turns it into a smart display. Plus, it's around $200 cheaper. But if you have your heart set on a big tablet for watching movies and multitasking on the go and want to keep your spending in check, the Tab S9 FE+ is a solid choice. There's nothing really special that stands out about the device, but as a general everyday tablet (that happens to be larger than average and comes with a stylus in the box), it's quite good.

        "content": "CHENNAI, India – Mitchell Starc bowled a sensational opening spell to fire Kolkata Knight Riders to their third Indian Premier League title with an eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Sunday final. Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for IPL’s lowest total of 113 in a final as Australia’s left-arm quick Starc returned figures of 2-14 to live up to his top billing in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament. Starc went to Kolkata for a record $2.98 million in the December auction and ended the IPL with two stellar performances, including a match-winning 3-34 in the first play-off to hammer the same opponent. Kolkata’s batsmen had it easy and despite Sunil Narine’s early departure, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who made 39, and Venkatesh Iyer, on 52 not out, helped the team home with 9.3 overs to spare after a partnership of 91. Iyer, a left-handed batsman, reached his 50 in 24 balls and hit the winning runs to trigger celebrations for Kolkata, who remained the most dominant team after they ended top of the table with 20 points in the league phase. Skipper Shreyas Iyer was unbeaten on six, and at the other end, when Kolkata players came rushing on to the pitch and the stadium fireworks went off. It was Kolkata’s second title triumph at the venue, after they won their first trophy in 2012, and a near-capacity crowd at the 36,000-seater stadium cheered on. Apart from the big signing of Starc, they got Gautam Gambhir as mentor after the former India batsman led the team to two titles. Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first and go with his team’s strength of scoring big, after they racked up IPL record totals of 277 and 287 in this year’s edition. Hyderabad took Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and made him captain after he led Australia to two titles, including the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup last year. But Starc took the limelight as he struck in his first over when he bowled in-form Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma, for two, on a delivery that pitched in the middle and caught the top of off stump. Travis Head followed his fellow left-hand opener Abhishek to the dug-out, caught behind for his second duck in three matches off fast bowler Vaibhav Arora. Starc struck again and the opposition top-order was in disarray at 47-4 inside seven overs. Andre Russell took down Aiden Markram for 20 and wickets kept tumbling as fellow South African Heinrich Klaasen fell for 16. Cummins, who was dropped on 10 by Starc, took the team past 100 before falling for 24 off Russell, who ended with figures of 3-19.",

        "content": "close Video Hunter Biden's gun charges are more dangerous than his tax charges, says Former acting AG Former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker provides his expectations ahead of New York v. Trump's closing arguments and the political impact of Hunter Biden's upcoming gun trial. President Biden paid a visit to his daughter-in-law's home Sunday night, days before the ninth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden, who was her husband. The president's brief visit to Hallie Biden's home also comes before she is expected to testify as a witness in Hunter Biden's gun crime trial next month. The first son is charged with making false statements on a federal form when purchasing a firearm in 2018. A source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018, police report told Fox News that it indicated that Hallie, who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter Biden in a dumpster behind a market near a school. She is likely to be required to testify in the upcoming trial. HUNTER BIDEN PRETRIAL HEARING ON GUN CHARGES SET FOR FRIDAY IN DELAWARE President Biden paid a visit to his daughter-in-law's home Sunday night, days before the ninth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden, who was her husband. (Michael Reynolds/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) A reporter for NBC News faced heavy criticism for pointing out her connection to the trial on social media. Biden allies argued there was nothing inappropriate about the visit. The court in Hunter Biden's case met for its final hearing before jury selection begins on June 3. Fox News has previously reported that prosecutors planned to use portions of his book and laptop, including photos, to convince a jury that the first son is guilty of making false statements on a federal form when he purchased a revolver in 2018, while actively using narcotics. Biden has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge Maryellen Noreika said Special Counsel David Weiss must show Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs, but not necessarily using drugs the day he purchased the gun.

        "content": "VICTORIA EDEME speaks to business consultant and Chief Strategy Officer for Shoprite Nigeria, Bunmi Adeleye, on her career journey and experiences. C ould you tell us about your educational and career background? I refer to myself as a strategist, mentor, and speaker. I have worked for over two decades and my background is in computer science and information systems. I have worked across companies in Africa and other global companies like Heineken in sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and the United Kingdom. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from the University of Benin, Nigeria, and a Master of Science degree from the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom. I’m a certified Change Management practitioner and a fellow of the International Association for Strategy Professionals. I’ve attended various leadership and functional training globally. What was your childhood like? I lost my father at a very tender age. I remember growing up with my mum, who became the head of home due to the loss of my father. I have two siblings – a brother and a sister – and my mum did everything to ensure we had the best education through primary, secondary, and university. I remember very well that my mother used to have a distribution business. She used to work with the Leventis stores in Benin. I grew up in Benin. When we lost my father, we were in Kwara State. My father was in the military and we had to travel a lot. I was born in Uromi in Edo State. After we lost my father, my mother had to relocate to Benin. My father was from Kwara State. What was one experience you had growing up that influenced what you have become today? I remember my mum working in a retail company then, Leventis, and today, I’m also working in a retail company. It’s so funny that there’s a lot of coincidence. What I remember growing up was travelling as my father was in the military. He was transferred a lot. So we had to live in different states. We lived in Jalingo, Kaba, and Uromi. We travelled a lot. I also remember my mum used to cook pepper soup. I can never forget that experience because she asked me to sit down by her in the kitchen where she prepared it, which birthed my love for cooking. I like experimenting with food. When I’m not working, people will refer to me as ‘Chef Bum Bum’ because I do a lot of cooking and try out cuisines from different parts of the world. What influence did your parents have in your life journey? Seeing my mum single-handedly bringing up three kids all by herself, working, and giving us the best has taught me how to remain resilient, be strong as a woman, and accept circumstances that might befall me. I remember how my mum had to do multiple jobs to ensure she put food on our table. I grew up in Benin as a young, pretty, and dark-skinned woman. People often approached my mum to sponsor me to Italy. It is common in Edo State to see young women that go to Italy for different reasons. Sponsors may tell you that you’d get a job, keep homes, or carry children for people. My mum disagreed because she doesn’t have many children and I’m her first child. She was tempted because a lot of young girls had left the country for Europe and all parts of the world. A lot of suitors also came around to marry me but my mother didn’t agree because she wanted me to go to school. It’s part of what I am today, knowing that life will always throw its curveballs at you but you must have the ability to come back on your feet and deal with it. What was your dream while growing up? As a child, I saw myself as the family woman, living in my full femininity, with a well-kept home and family, and not doing a nine-to-five job. When I was in secondary school, I used to love food and nutrition, clothing and textiles, and other creative subjects but my mother wouldn’t have it. She wanted me to become a medical doctor or even a lawyer, and that was how I left my food and nutrition to go on with pure science in senior secondary school. I never had any dream of being a doctor or a computer scientist. I even have the knitted clothes, table covers, chair covers, and recipes I had while growing up. Why did you decide to study Computer Science at the university? Getting into school, I knew I couldn’t have read medicine or pharmacy, so the next thing available was computer science. It wasn’t because we saw the future or we saw the prospects that technology would have, it’s just that computer science was just the next logical thing on the jump. Where did you work after graduation? After I graduated in the late 90s, I served in Enugu State. My first assignment was with Nigerian Telecommunications and I worked in the Management Information Systems Department as a programmer. After my youth service, I came to Lagos and got a job. My first assignment was with Ecobank as a programmer and software developer. As a programmer, I used to code in Fortran, Cobol, and C++, to develop in-house software for consumer banking. That was my first major job. How did you move from the banking to the retail industry? I began my career as a software developer at the then Allstates Trust Bank (which was acquired by Ecobank). After working at the bank, I went to do my Master’s in Information Systems in the United Kingdom. I then got a job as a data-based administrator at SchlumbergerSema in the United Kingdom. That company is now called Atos Consulting; it’s a Belgian company. After working at SchlumbergerSema, I got a job with the Heineken Company in the UK. I was employed as an expatriate from the UK through the Heineken Young African Talent Programme; a programme that the company used to headhunt Africans in the diaspora to develop them to be leaders. Heineken was then in over 70 countries. I came to Nigeria after my induction in Amsterdam and my first assignment was as a project manager in Human Resources to implement the Campus Management Initiative. A programme with the goal to attract the best graduating students from Nigerian universities. I then worked as a Risk Analyst in the Audit Department before taking up the role of a Business Controller where I was a pioneer business controller. I went back to Europe as a senior programme manager in major technology projects that span six countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Rwanda, Burundi, DRC, Nigeria, and two other countries. After that project, I came back to run a major Enterprise Resource Planning software. I moved from doing business process improvement as a technology project manager to being a change lead for a major ERP implementation in the region. I came to Nigeria to become the change lead for SAP implementation in Nigerian business. After successfully implementing the ERP, working together with Accenture, the group IT, and the Nigerian employees, I moved from there to finance as a regional finance manager, still in Heineken. My career was across different departments. It was when I was working as a Sales Business Controller, I had another expatriation job.I had to leave Nigeria again to go overseas for another assignment. So this time around, I went to Ethiopia to be part of the post acquisition of two major breweries; Bedele and Harar. I went there to lead the business process development and management department responsible for the ERP Implementation and ensuring a seamless transformation of both breweries to The Heineken Company global standards. After my assignment in Ethiopia, I left the Heineken company to set up my consulting firm and to focus on other things. How long did you spend in Heineken? I spent over 11 years at Heineken. I joined them in 2002 and left in 2014. What year did you establish your consulting firm? I established Atunda Consulting in 2017. When I left Ethiopia, I returned to Nigeria to try other things. That was when I started a non-governmental foundation called the Novel Opportunities for Women foundation. I didn’t have that balance that I wanted. I took time off work for almost three years and didn’t do anything. So for two years, I focused on myself and my mental health and took a consulting job with Execution Edge. That was when I became an independent consultant; helping small to medium businesses to improve their operational efficiency to save costs by using the experiences I’ve had working with Heineken. So I combined the consulting work I did with my non-profit experiences. Could you share your experience as a business consultant? As an independent consultant, I had the opportunity to work on major technology implementation projects with companies like UAC Foods Limited, and Dangote International Limited, while helping companies like ADECCO Projects Engineering West Africa and some small and medium businesses in insurance, telecommunications and food processing develop and implement strategies to achieve their goals. This was until the acquisition of Shoprite by Nigerian institutional investors in 2021. I joined the post acquisition team as the change lead for Shoprite transformation programme. I was appointed as a consultant to help with the change management process, called post-integration. After the implementation, I took up a permanent position in 2022. They wanted me to be their Chief Strategy Officer not on a consulting basis but full-time. In your years of expertise, have you ever been looked down on because you are a woman? Yes. I often tell people that if I weren’t a woman, I would have been more successful as a consultant in Nigeria. When I worked at Heineken’s global office in Europe through the youth programme, I and two other females who were employed weren’t exposed to gender inequality but when I came to the Nigerian office, we realised that it was male-dominated. When we came in, the Nigerian Breweries had only three female managers out of over 3,500 employees. Most females there were often secretaries, typists, or cleaners. It was so bad that there were no female toilets in the brewery because a majority of those at the site were men. The three of us came in and we experienced serious resistance. When we travel with our male counterparts to locations, those receiving us will carry only the bags of the males and leave us. However, the senior male managers knew better because they were more exposed. I remember they used to call me ‘Oga Madam’. It was male-dominated and they only started embracing women after some time. When the Heineken Group acquired a majority share in Nigeria, they made a deliberate effort to bridge the gender gap, encourage women, and give them breathing space. So there was a lot of inclusion and diversity. When we came, we were the second generation of female managers, and today, the story is different. As a consultant, I must say that I had some challenges and I wonder why most women don’t talk about these things. As a woman, I would submit the same proposal as that of a man but the man will most likely get the contact because it is easier for men to network with men than for a woman to do the same. The decision-makers during such contracts are men and they may ask you to have a drink with them or meet at the club. Men can do that but the woman would have to go home to her family. At the end of the day, because you are not doing what they are doing, you are not able to get the contract. I lost a lot of opportunities as a consultant because I was not flexible like my male counterparts. Most men do not even want to hear your pitch because you are a woman unless you came highly recommended or you have connections. However, where I work now, it’s balanced. Generally, we also have more women than men in the retail sector. However, the owners of modern retail companies in Nigeria, like the one I work in, are mostly owned by men.",

        "content": "The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) in partnership with the Kwara State government, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of free Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine against cervical cancer among school children in the state. At the rollout of the HPV vaccine in Ilorin, the state capital, the executive director and chief executive officer of the NPHCDA, Dr. Muyi Aina, said that cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. A total of 787 school children were vaccinated at the event. Aina, who was represented by Sheu Hassan, said that the HPV vaccine is a very important vaccine, adding that, “it prevents the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and causes more than 95 per cent of cases of cervical cancer.” He said that all eligible girls between the ages of 9-14 years across 193 wards in the 16 local government areas of Kwara State will be vaccinated against cervical cancer during the five-day programme. “I believe that together, we will achieve the goal of this exercise. At least 80% eligible girls aged 9 to 14 years will be reached during the five days intensification, after which the HPV vaccines will be accessed by our girls through routine immunization services in our PHC facilities. “Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women globally and the second most common cancer affecting women in Nigeria. It is estimated that 604,000 cases with 342,000 deaths occurred globally in 2020, and an estimated 12,075 cases and 7,968 deaths were recorded in Nigeria,” he stated. The NPHCDA boss, who said that the HPV vaccine was free, safe, and effective, urged stakeholders to mobilise family members, friends, and communities to ensure that all eligible girls get vaccinated. “Let me thank and appreciate the Kwara State Government for its support in strengthening PHC in the state. I want to specially thank Her Excellency Professor Olufolake AbdulRazaq for her role in the fight against cervical cancer. “HPV vaccines with corresponding devices and operational funds have been provided to the states to support this exercise. I must thank his Excellency, the governor of Kwara state, for his regular release of counterparts’ funds to support PHC activities, including the HPV introduction. “Your support, that of the Governors Wives forum, wives of LGA chairmen, traditional/religious leaders, Civil Society Organizations, Women groups, media, and other relevant stakeholders remain paramount to the success of the HPVV introduction and other PHC activities. “The NPHCDA remains committed to collaborating with the sub-national levels to strengthen routine immunization and other PHC services for better health for all,” Aina added. In her remarks, the wife of the Kwara State governor, Ambassador Olufolake AbdulRazaq, assured of the efficacy of the vaccine, while she charged stakeholders to dispel negative rumours and misconception against the HPV vaccines. “Today’s event set the tone for an ambitious, inclusive strategy to accelerate eliminating cervical cancer as a public health concern. Elimination is within the reach of all hence we in Kwara are committed to towing this path to ensure that we seize the opportunities that are within our reach now, so that our girls will live free of this disease. “In complementing the efforts that culminated in incorporating the HPV vaccine into the National routine immunization schedule and today’s roll out however, I urge key stakeholders in respective communities to continue to amplify awareness and sensitization on benefits of presenting eligible children for the vaccine. “This no doubt will entail engagements with our communities, traditional and religious institutions to educate, inform, and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the HPV vaccine,” the Kwara State First Lady added.",

        "description": "The ‘King of Clay’ said it was difficult to talk about his future after defeat to Alexander Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal said he did not know if he had played his last match at the French Open but revealed appearing at the Olympic Games at Roland Garros this summer is “motivation” to continue his career after defeat to Alexander Zverev. The 14-time French Open champion, who turns 38 next week, said there is a “big percentage” his defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev was his last match at the tournament he has dominated for almost 20 years . Nadal was handed a brutal first-round match with Zverev one of the contenders for the title after winning in Rome last week, and the 27-year-old became just the third player, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, to beat Nadal in his 116 matches at the French Open , In an emotional on-court interview after the defeat, Nadal said he was given hope by his performance, but said it was “difficult” to talk about his future. Nadal spoke in front of a packed Court Philippe-Chatrier, the scene of Nadal’s 14 French Open titles, and addressed a crowd that included wife Xisca, baby son Rafael Jr and fellow tennis stars Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. Here’s Nadal’s post-match speech in full \"It is difficult for me to talk, I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I am not 100 per cent sure. “If it is the last time, then you, the crowd, have been amazing. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me, it is so special to feel the love in the place I love the most. \"I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match and last week, victory in Rome. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 [when Zverev broke his ankle in his semi-final defeat to Nadal at the French Open] was a tough moment for you and you deserve more, so all the best. \"For me, as I said before, I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. It is true that the first round wasn’t the ideal one. I needed something else! I was competitive, I had chances but it was difficult against a great player as Sasha. \"It’s difficult for me to say about the future. There is a big percentage I won’t be back at Roland Garros but I can’t say 100 per cent. I am enjoying myself, I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. “Maybe, in two months, I say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else. But that is something I don’t feel yet. I have goals. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. That’s going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court throughout my career, it’s just unbelievable. When I was a kid I couldn’t imagine being here at almost 38 with all of the success. Winning so many times, I couldn’t dream about it. “It has been a very beautiful process. All the memories are very special. All the people who are in Roland Garros behind the scenes helping me since I came here, and the support of my people. I can’t thank them all enough. “Last thing, all the people, the feelings you made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” Rafael Nadal set to miss Wimbledon: ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea’ Rafael Nadal is set to miss Wimbledon next month and may never play at the All England Club again as retirement looms, writes Kieran Jackson. The 37-year-old has won two Wimbledon titles amongst his collection of 22 Grand Slams. Nadal insists he will compete at Roland Garros again as he targets the Paris Olympics in two months’ time and, as a result, put his presence on the grass at Wimbledon into serious doubt. Asked whether he thinks he will play on grass and at Wimbledon, he said: “[It] looks difficult, honestly. “For me now, it looks difficult to make the transition to grass when we have the Olympics again on clay. “I cannot confirm anything, I need to analyse so many facts. I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happen to my body, to make a transition to a completely different surface, then come back to clay. “Today I don’t think that’s a good idea, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.”",

        "description": "According to the Washington Post, Alito's wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, \"It’s an international signal of distress\" after being probed by the reporter on the flag.",
        "content": "The Washington Post revealed on Saturday that the outlet initially passed on the Samuel Alito flag story in 2021 after its former Supreme Court reporter had a confrontation over it with the justice’s wife. “The Post decided not to report on the episode at the time because the flag-raising appeared to be the work of Martha-Ann Alito, rather than the justice, and connected to a dispute with her neighbors,” the Washington Post report said, citing a spokesperson for the paper. “It was not clear then that the argument was rooted in politics.” Former Washington Post Supreme Court reporter Robert Barnes went to the Alitos’ home in 2021 after receiving a tip on the flag. According to the outlet, Alito’s wife, Martha-Ann, shouted, “It’s an international signal of distress” after being probed by the reporter on the flag. An upside-down American flag, a symbol used by the former president’s supporters who falsely claim President Biden did not win the 2020 election, was seen flying at Alito’s home in the weeks following the Jan. 6 riot, The New York Times first reported last week. Alito previously told Fox News that his wife was the one who hung the flag in response to insults from a neighbor. Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor, took responsibility for not running the story at the time, according to Semafor. “I agreed with [Supreme Court reporter] Bob Barnes and others that we should not do a single-slice story about the flag, because it seemed like the story was about Martha-Ann Alito and not her husband,” Barr told the outlet. Semafor referred to the decision as “cautious and deferential, and very pre-Dobbs,” suggesting it meant more now after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade. “Now, it’s hard to imagine,” the outlet wrote. Subscribe to our daily Business Report newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Members of the media and prominent Democratic lawmakers are calling on Alito to recuse himself from all cases before the court that are related to Donald Trump. Conservatives have said the story is much ado about nothing and part of a wider effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court. “In retrospect, I should have pushed harder for that story,” Barr told Semafor. Alito’s wife reportedly told the Washington Post reporter to ask their neighbors what they did and told the reporter to get off their property. Another symbol carried by Trump supporters, an “Appeal to Heaven” flag , was seen flying at a beach home owned by Alito in New Jersey, the New York Times reported days after their initial report. The flag, also known as the Pine Tree flag, dates back to the Revolutionary War.",

        "description": "Deep fakes images, fake watches, fake handbags, fake beauty, fake friendships and faked successes. It seems all that is real and true in the world is actually fake! And what’s worse, the fakes are readily...",
        "content": "Deep fakes images, fake watches, fake handbags, fake beauty, fake friendships and faked successes. It seems all that is real and true in the world is actually fake! And what’s worse, the fakes are readily accepted and absorbed as a perfect alternative to reality or in fact; often interpreted as reality itself. I recently completed watching a much talked about series on Netflix, by a famed director. While I enjoyed the series and didn’t bother analysing the storyline too much. I did read a lot about certain actresses, their plastic surgeries and life histories. In fact, these gossipy tidbits overtook the series entirely and seemed to become a huge juggernaut spinning of its own volition. A lot was said about how people felt cheated that the actresses’ plastic surgeries left them feeling hoodwinked, that they weren’t authentic, and hence not valid. My beef however is not about the individual’s decision to get plastic surgery- after all, to each his own; but I do wonder about the impact of such perfect faces on the young generation growing up. This generation thinks that all faces have to look the same to be considered beautiful. That the homogenous “surgery face” with pouting lips, large eyes and perfect pert noses is the only face that matters. It seems that “variety is the spice of life” is an adage which just doesn’t cut it in this case! To me, the beauty of the human race lies ethnic differences. From the high cheekbone-d, red cheek-ed beauties of Himachal Pradesh in India to the ebony skinned, doll faced beauties of Ethiopia, to the blond Nordic beauties, the world has a lot to offer in terms of diverse features. In fact, the variety is reflected in flora and fauna across different continents as well...Which makes me wonder, why the recent push for fake beauty? What is the allure in fake aesthetics created not by nature but by the hands of a skilled surgeon? I suppose the answers lies again in social media (sigh) and the proliferation of influencers who peddle unrealistic body standards and proportional ideals. Bodies are no longer safe spaces, they are not allowed to remain as God created them, they are now a carefully curated amalgamation of the perceived “best features” of different races, cobbled to confound and perplex impressionable minds into thinking that if they just buy this lipstick then their lips will be equally full or if they save just enough then they can get the surgeries to get gravity defying butts. At Cannes this year, a revered veteran actress was trolled for her fashion sense and her aging face and body. While I won’t talk about her red-carpet fashion, I was shocked at the vitriol directed towards her ageing. Hateful comments about her weight, and age filled the internet, as well as “nostalgic” reels about how she used to look in her prime. The collective voices seemed to be indignant- how dare she age and put on weight- and if she has, how dare she show up in public like that! Imagine- an intelligent well read and highly accomplished woman, torn down because she didn’t succumb to various plastic surgeries to be able to conform to the standards on what the world at large thinks she should like, at the ripe old age of 50! (gasp). She should just disappear of course! Don’t get me wrong, I am not stating that everyone thinks like this, there are many who eschew fake things- but my concern is for the younger generation, which doesn’t have the benefit of childhoods untainted by the insidious tech that pervades every corner of our lives. Who is explaining the reality of fakeness to them?",

        "description": "While the U-turn portion of the structure is almost ready, the arm that lands on the CSIR Road, perpendicular to the IT Corridor, will take at least three months to complete",
        "content": "A portion of the U-shaped flyover on Rajiv Gandhi Salai near the Tidel Park junction, is nearing completion. Currently, painting work, fixing of lamp posts and electrical work are being carried out. Sources in the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC), which is executing the project, said that the U-turn portion of the flyover is almost ready. “We had been waiting for the rain to stop to lay the bituminous tar layer for about a length of 250 metres. This is for the approach ramps on either side,” said a source. The arm, which lands on CSIR Road, perpendicular to the IT Corridor, will take at least three months to complete. This is because of several issues pertaining to service utilities running beneath the road. “There is a power substation nearby and over 40 large-sized cables of 110 KVA and 230 KVA run from there to the IT companies in the area. We had a similar problem while constructing both the approach ramps for this flyover. When we cut open the road, we found bunches and bunches of cables that had to be slowly moved aside to facilitate construction. There were atleast three major cable cuts during that time and repairs had to be carried out,” explained an engineer associated with the project. TNRDC is also planning to dismantle and reconstruct the stormwater drains in the area to carry larger volumes of water. This is the second U-turn flyover on the road. The earlier one is in use near the Indira Nagar MRTS Station and it allows those coming from Tidel Park junction and wanting to reach ECR, Indira Nagar, Adyar and other places to reach the Indira Nagar bridge. This reduces the waiting time at the Tidel Park junction. Suresh Subramaniam, a resident of Thoraipakkam, said that the U-turn flyover was of great help. “Facilities should also be created for pedestrians near the two flyovers. The traffic police should take steps to ensure smooth traffic flow at SRP Tools junction where Metrorail work has begun and only four lanes are available for vehicular movement,” he suggested.

        "description": "Bill Walton won a championship with the Celtics in 1986.",
        "content": "Former Celtics center Bill Walton died Monday at age 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer. The NBA great was surrounded by his family at the time of his death according to a statement released by the NBA. Walton was a legendary force in the basketball world on the collegiate and NBA level, winning multiple titles on both level. He won a pair of NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973 while leading UCLA on a 88-game winning streak over multiple seasons. The Portland Trail Blazers selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft and he went on to win a title with the Blazers and a Finals MVP in 1977 before foot injuries derailed a large chunk of his career with the Clippers. He saw a career resurgence in Boston after the team acquired him in the summer of 1985. Walton’s long NBA career wrapped up when he played for the Celtics, winning the 1986 title as he was a bench player at that point in his career. But he was instrumental that season, winning the 1986 Sixth Man of the Year award as he played in a career-high 80 games (two starts) as a backup for Robert Parish. That was despite major injury questions coming into the season after getting traded from the Clippers. He wasn’t able to play during the 1987-88 season due to the injuries, and while he attempted a comeback in February 1990, he retired from the league as a player shortly afterwards. Walton spoke fondly of his time with the Celtics, giving him one last opportunity at the end of his career to make an impact. He dealt with injuries during his time in Boston, but he was able to be a key contributor to a championship team. Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993 and was also selected to the NBA’s 50th and 75th anniversary teams. Walton also thrived as a color commentator and studio analyst for NBA and college basketball after his retirement, leaving a lasting impact on the game as a beloved personality. NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement after his passing. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.”",

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Both the CPM and the state government have found themselves entangled in the controversy over the new liquor policy. The party is of the view that relaxations in the liquor policy are necessary for the development of the tourism sector in the state and to attract more investment in industrial and IT parks. However, the controversy erupted even before the government took a decision on the liquor policy. In this situation, how can the government announce relaxations in the liquor policy? If the government announces relaxations, it will be interpreted as the confirmation of taking bribes from the bar owners. The party and the government are finding it hard to make a decision on the matter. Neither the CPM nor the LDF has held a discussion on the bar owners' bar owners' demands to do away with the dry day system and extend the operating hours of bars. The controversy broke out when a voice message sent by a leader of the bar owners' association asking each bar owner to pay Rs 2.50 lakhs in exchange for the relaxations from the government came out. The voice message was sent by Animon, a state leader of the Federation of Kerala Bar Association. It is alleged that there is a massive bribery deal behind this. The opposition is planning to launch widespread protests against the government even though CPM state secretary MV Govindan and Excise Minister MB Rajesh are claiming that the government has not even started a preliminary discussion on the liquor policy. Opposition targeting Chief Minister The opposition, which demanded the resignation of Excise Minister MB Rajesh, turned against Tourism Minister PA Mohammed Riyas after the details of the meeting called by the Tourism Director came out. It is asking if the Tourism Director would call a meeting without the knowledge of the Tourism Minister. By portraying Minister Riyas as the main mastermind in the bar bribery controversy, the opposition is targeting Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The opposition is also trying to take advantage of the resentment that a section of the CPM has towards Riyas.",

        "content": "OAKLAND — Firefighters stood watch on Monday over the smoldering remains of a long-time lumber yard in Oakland that was scorched by a four-alarm fire this weekend, as an investigation into the blaze begins. The fire consumed Economy Lumber at 750 High Street in Oakland. The Oakland Fire Department said the blaze was first reported around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday. By 11 p.m., the same night, firefighters had contained the fire, Oakland fire spokesperson Michael Hunt said. “Crews are still on scene at Economy Lumber,” Hunt said Monday. “We’ll probably be on scene most of the day.” The wrecked complex is the site of one of four lumber yards that Economy Lumber operates in the Bay Area. Oakland fire investigators were attempting to determine the cause of the fire. The Oakland Fire Department also began working with the property owner and a heavy equipment operator to pull apart the building so crews could reach any remaining hot spots, Hunt said. About 75 firefighters responded to the site of the fire Sunday. No injuries were reported as a result of the blaze. Economy Lumber has been in business since 1935. The company was born as a small lumber business and eventually expanded to four Bay Area locations. It wasn’t immediately known when 750 High Street lumber yard began operating.",

        "content": "( KTLA ) – NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has died at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. The accomplished basketball center died of cancer, according to ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski , who cited the league as his source. In a statement, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called Walton “truly one of a kind,” citing his impact both on the court and in the broadcast booth, “where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans.” “But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton started at UCLA under legendary coach John Wooden. The pair won national championships in 1972 and 1973, and Walton was thrice the national college player of the year. Walton was named Most Valuable Player multiple times throughout his decade-long professional basketball career, which began with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1974 and ended with the Boston Celtics in 1988. After retiring as a player, the UCLA alumni pivoted to sports commentary for college basketball with ESPN, NBC Sports and CBS Sports. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Aside from his time on the court, Walton was known for his love of jam bands, particularly the Grateful Dead, and was often spotted in a tie-dyed shirt while broadcasting basketball games. Despite what the NBA called “a prolonged battle with cancer,” Walton was spotted at this year’s NBA All-Star Game with a smile on his face. Walton is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris.",

        "content": "Ever since her retirement in September 2022, Serena Williams has spent more time with her family. Ahead of the release of her 8-part series, Williams took some time out and went for a family vacation in France. Her husband Alexis Ohanian and daughters Olympia Ohanian and Adira Ohanian were having a great time too. But what the most attention online was Olympia’s braids. Alexis Ohanian shares a great father-daughter bond with Olympia, as evident through their countless Instagram posts together. He bakes ‘artsy’ pancakes for her in the shape of cartoon characters and also spends quality time with her. Being the doting father, Alexis shared a picture of Olympia from Paris, where she is looking at a small pond. The picture was beautiful, with flowers and greenery all around. But viewers noticed the new hairstyle on Olympia – her braids. It was long and luscious and braided all over. It was a refreshing change since the spotlight was off her mother Serena Williams, for once. Both Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian have been raising their kids with the utmost freedom. Be it her right to exercise freedom while playing, talking, or even styling herself, Olympia’s parents have always encouraged her. Allowing her to experiment with her looks is just a small step for Olympia to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Here’s how some of the comments were under the Instagram post: But this is not the first time Olympia Ohanian has gone viral for her looks. Olympia adorably tried on Serena Williams’ Met Gala 2021 look for its 2023 edition to twin with her mother for the event, making it a first of sorts. When Olympia Ohanian tried to pull off Serena Williams’ iconic Met Gala look At the 2021 Met Gala, Serena Williams wore a pink cape that was fuzzy. The cape displayed various shades of pink, with the edges being black. It was an iconic look for the tennis legend, who was wearing a silver bodice dress. A year or two later, Serena Williams posted an Instagram video, with the same dress one more time. Only this time, it was her daughter Olympia trying it on. Olympia was wearing that same fuzzy pink cape and walking inside their closet. The video was clubbed to the song ‘Made You Look’ by Meghan Trainor. At age 6, Olympia might just be the biggest star kid in the world right now. With unbelievably famous parents who encourage her at every step, Olympia is blessed to have them by her side. She was also made the owner of two sports clubs – Los Angeles Golf Club and soccer team Angel City. The future seems bright for the young star kid.",

The suspect, a 43-year-old man, fled on foot. He was found near Wallace Avenue and East Seventh Street and was arrested \"without incident,\" police said. He is being held at the St. Louis County jail under pending charges of attempted first-degree murder.

        "content": "Bill Walton, a two-time NBA champion and two-time league All-Star before becoming one of the league's most prominent voices on TV, died at age 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton won an NBA title in 1977 as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. He capped off his career with a title with the Boston Celtics in 1986. He was a league All-Star back-to-back years in 1977 and 1978. Before entering the NBA, he won consecutive titles in 1972 and 1973 with the UCLA Bruins. He later had his number retired by UCLA. Walton was also a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, which controversially lost to the Soviet Union, costing the U.S. a chance at the gold medal. Following his playing career, he joined CBS, and later NBC and ABC/ESPN, to broadcast college and NBA games. He was also enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement reacting to Walton's passing. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams,\" Silver said. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.\"",
