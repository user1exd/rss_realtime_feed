        "content": "The battle over Elon Musk’s compensation package is heating up as a big advisory firm is recommending shareholders vote against it, and Musk fans are resorting to scare tactics. Over the last few weeks, Tesla shareholders have been voting on several new proposals put forward by the board. The two main proposals that the board is trying to get through are a new vote on Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package and moving Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas. The two are closely related as Tesla’s board and Musk have blamed the fact that they lost a lawsuit invalidating the 2018 compensation package on the fact that the lawsuit happened in Delware, where Tesla is incorporated. Tesla incorporated in Delaware, like many other American companies, because the states has laws extremely favorable to corporations. However, Musk believes, without any evidence, that the judge’s decision was politically motivated and believes that Tesla would have better luck in Texas. And Tesla will need better luck because the new shareholder’s vote on the compensation package doesn’t automatically invalidate the judge’s decision to rescind the package and more legal challenges are expected. Tesla’s own lawyers admit it’s basically a poll. Regardless, Tesla has been pushing hard for shareholders to revote in favor the package and the move to Texas. As we previously reported, and even started . The shareholder battle is starting to heat up. We recently reported on and encouraged other shareholders to do the same. Now Glass Lewis, a major shareholder advisory firm whose clients include a significant part of major institutional investors, announced that they are also recommending to vote against it, which they also did in 2018, and shareholders still approved the move. On the other hand, Musk’s army of fans are resorting to scare tactics to push the vote in his direction. We recently reported on Musk’s unless he has 25% control over the company. It was confirmed today that Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, has raised $6 billion a new series B round at a $24 billion valuation. Some of his biggest sycophants, like unofficial chief propagandist Omar Qazi, are now pushing the idea that if they don’t decide to give Musk everything he wants, he will go after Tesla’s AI efforts through its newly funded xAI: Tell me you have Stockholm syndrome without telling me you have Stockholm syndrome: This is basically suggesting that shareholders should fold to Musk’s threat. During the litigation over the compensation package, Musk was directly asked if the package being voted down by shareholders would make him leave Tesla and he said no. However, things could have changed since, but the CEO is conveniently not commenting on this now – seemingly preferring to let his sycophants spread the fear that he would leave Tesla if they don’t vote for his pay package again. I have a hard time believing that Elon would leave Tesla if the package doesn’t go through. That would be giving up and that’s not his type. Also, I haven’t seen many Tesla shareholders argue that he shouldn’t get paid. I think the vast majority of shareholders agree that Elon should get paid, but they want Tesla to address the clear governance issues that led the package to be revoked in the first place and that re now more evident than ever as the board is letting the CEO openly making threats to shareholders. In my opinion, Tesla needs stronger governance because Elon simply doesn’t have the right temperament to lead a public company. Like Leo Koguan, Tesla’s largest retail investor, said, . We are now seeing the repercussions with the threats, the way he fired the entire Supercharger teams to set an example to other execs, and this pay package being rescinded. and subscribe to the .

        "content": "Bob Dylan guitarist Robbie Robertson's kids sue his widow for 'elder abuse' in ugly spat over inheritance The adult kids of Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, It names Janet Zuccarini, Robertson's 58-year-old widow, as the sole defendant She wed Robertson months before his August death, making him sign a prenup By Alex Hammer For Dailymail.Com Published: 17:08 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:12 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The children of a late guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s have sued his widow over allegations of alleged elder abuse. The adult offspring of the renowned Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Janet Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant. She wed Robertson months before his death this past August at age 80, and now the late musician's kid claims she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, especially when it came to the ownership of a Beverly Hills 'trophy home'. That residence once belonged to the producer of Little Shop of Horrors David Geffen, and was purchased by the pair based on an agreement that they would share ownership of the home equally However, the lawsuit claims Robertson - one the founding members of famed Americana group The Band - covered the $1.8 million down payment in full, and cites how within two years, Xuccarini allegedly convinced him to elope. The children of Robbie Robertson, a renowned guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s before dying last year, have sued his widow - 58-year-old Janet Zuccarini (seen with the guitarist in 2019) over allegations of 'elder abuse' Delphine, Alexandra and Sebastian Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant This, the suit states, happened in a private ceremony 'kept secret' from the artist's kids, while Robertson's health and mental capacity was in decline. Prior to the 2023 wedding, Zuccarini, 58, allegedly had Robertson sign a prenup, as well an amended Tenant In Common agreement that stated if one of them died, the estate of the deceased would continue to pay half of the mortgage. This left the guitarist's estate and trust, Adriane Hibbert and David Jackel, on the hook, and led them to wage the current case against Zuccarini. Robertson's three kids, fellow musician Sebastian, Delphine, and Alexandra, are now part of the suit, which alleges Zuccarini financially abused their father to inherit part of his estate. 'A great time for marriage,' the suit states of Zuccarini's alleged mindset at the time, arranging a private wedding away from the musician's family in March 2023 She then had Robertson, who played with The Band from their inception until 1978, sign the prenuptial agreement, knowing he 'was no longer able to read and would not comprehend the true import of what he was signing.' She then saw an 'opportunity to embark on a marriage with a sick and dying man,' before getting Robinson to spend some $175,957 on renovations and $3,381.31 on 'furniture and furnishings' on the Beverly Hills three-bedroom. A five-time Grammy nominee who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Robbie is seen here shredding with Dylan back in 1972, before he went on to become one of the founding members of The Band The suit centers around the pair's purchase of this Beverly Hills home, which they said was Zuccarini's handiwork. The home was bought less than two years before Zuccarini wed Robertson in March 2023, a ceremony held months before his death this past August The late musician's kids claim she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, unbeknownst to them, old friends like Dylan, and the guitarist's ex-wife Dominique Bourgeois. The trio are seen together in 2022 The suit slams this as 'financial elder abuse' and 'tortious interference with inheritance', citing how Zuccarini pursued the prenup and wedding in secret so that neither they nor his ex-wife, Dominique Bourgeois, would 'be able to review' it. They claim they only learned about the marriage - allegedly only attended by Zuccarini's sister and brother-in-law - hours after it happened, showing up to the new house for what they assumed was an anniversary party. The trio went on to discern it was a wedding party, after which Robertson’s children said they were told, straight from their father, that 'nothing in his estate plan had changed'. They were further told that they would 'receive all of his property upon death' - a promise that did not pan out following the five-time Grammy nominee's death. The suit, which seeks to cancel the amended Tenancy In Common agreement while also seeking unspecified damages, is currently grinding its way through the California courts. Robertson, who had a professional and personal bond with Dylan that stretched back more than half a century, died of complications created by pancreatic cancer on August 9. When Dylan controversially went electric in the mid-1960s , it was his The Band that provided his onstage backing. Two days after Robertson's death, Dylan told Billboard : ' This is shocking news. Robbie was a lifelong friend. His passing leaves a vacancy in the world.'

        "content": "A string of powerline thefts and tampering has police appealing for information, and warning that thieves are putting themselves and others at “extreme risk of electrocution”. Over the past 10 days reports of power line thefts have been increasing across Christchurch, including at Disraeli St in Addingto n, Hillview Rd area, Phillips Rd in Phillipstown and Brougham St. There have also been reports as far as West Melton, Halswell, and Marshlands. On multiple occasions, residents have been left without power due to the theft of copper from the lines, police said. Police have informed community control and frontline units on what to look out for. Businesses and locals in the affected neighbourhoods have also been alerted. The offenders leave the power lines dangerous and exposed once they get what they want, police said. On one occasion a set was left broken outside Phillip St preschool. “Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone, including yourself, gets hurt,” said Senior Sergeant Roy Appley. “You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return.” Police are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in identifying those involved. They are urging residents to ring 111 immediately if anyone is seen acting suspiciously around power poles or lines. “If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it,” Appley said. “We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires – do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away.” Share this article",

Mike Morgan was feeding his cattle from a trailer when he was struck. He died on the scene after emergency responders tried to resuscitate him, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said. Morgan's wife, Niki, was approximately 200 feet away from Morgan when the lightning bolt struck and it was strong enough to knock her off her horse, according to a Facebook post from His Cavvy Foundation , a nonprofit helping ranchers with serious medical issues. Morgan's father-in-law was also reportedly near the blast but survived. The strike bowled over around 100 head of cattle that had crowded around the trailer that Morgan was feeding them out of, county coroner George Crocket said. Mike Morgan was killed in a freak lightning strike over the weekend, Jackson County officials revealed Monday Morgan, 51, was a rancher in the town of Walden, Colorado, a tight-knit community outside of Denver Morgan's family was recently able to afford 300 cattle of their own, and it was their dream to own their own animals 'All but the 34 got up,' Crocket added. The lightning bolt struck a pasture outside the town of Rand, which is about 80 miles northwest of Denver, NBC reported. Morgan is survived by his wife Niki and his 17-year-old daughter, Dallas, both of whom are involved in the ranching occupation as well. The His Cavvy Foundation described Morgan and his family as 'an upstanding pillar' in the town of Walden, Colorado. The foundation's post explained that Morgan had always been working on a local ranch, which recently afforded the family the opportunity to purchase 300 pairs. Pairs refer to a cow and her calf. 'Mike’s wife, Niki, has spent all winter calving these pairs out while Mike held down a job at Silver Spur Ranches,' the post said. 'They do what we all do, whatever it takes to make a living, and they do it by doing what we are all passionate about. Ranching...' The His Cavvy Foundation wrote that Morgan's family has donated time, resources and finances to its various causes throughout the years. 'Mike was a loving father and a tender, intentional husband,' the post said. 'We will all miss that big ole smile he always carried.'

        "content": "Embattled Professor Gregory Akenzua, one of the suspended Enigie (duke) on Monday got a second suspension, this time from the Benin Royal Family who wielded the big stick on him for taking the Oba of Benin to court to challenge their suspension as Enigie in the kingdom. Professor Gregory Akenzua, a professor of Gynecology, former Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin and former chairman Governing Council of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma is a younger brother to Oba Erediauwa, the father of Oba Ewuare II. Addressing a press conference in Benin, members of the royal family including descendants of Oba Ovonramwen, Oba Eweka, Oba Akenzua II, Oba Erediauwa and others said, Professor Akenzua against all entreaties have chosen to challenge the Benin Traditional Institution through his acts “that are utterly at variance with the customs and tradition of the Benin people, and the core values of the Benin Royal Family.” When contacted for his reaction, Professor Akenzua said he was in Lagos “for an engagement” and requested time to respond. Reading from a press statement on behalf of the royal family, Prince George Eweka said “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua, has betrayed the core values of respect for the Benin Customs and Tradition, devotion and submission to the customary hierarchy of the Benin Kingdom; and respect for customary arbitration process. Instead, he has chosen the path of rebellion; “For the avoidance of doubt, the Royal Family wishes to emphasize that His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin occupies a unique position as the father of every member of the Benin Royal Family irrespective of age. “Hence the Royal family does not have an Okaegbe, like other families in Benin Kingdom but Odion Egbe who is required by tradition to defer to His Royal Majesty; “The Royal Family also notes that in utter violation of the hierarchy of succession to the Odion-Egbe position of the Benin Royal Family, Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has been parading himself as the Odion-Egbe of the Royal Family, and has held meetings to assert himself as such when he knows that he is not rightfully entitled to the position being far lower in the hierarchy of seniority in the Benin Royal Family; “The Benin Royal Family has given ample opportunities to Prof.Gregory Idurobo Akenzua to retrace his steps and return to the path of honour and dignity; “Prof. Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has snubbed and rejected the opportunities provided by the Royal Family for him to retrace his wrongful steps. “After a careful review of the facts, the Benin Royal Family has decided as follows: “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is hereby suspended from the Benin Royal Family for his acts of rebellion against the Benin Traditional Institution; “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is no longer to participate in any activity connected with the Benin Royal Family; “All members of the Benin Royal Family are strongly directed not to relate, associate, or engage with Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua for as long as he remains suspended from the Benin Royal Family.”",

Ini merupakan Opini WTP ke-10 berturut-turut yang diperoleh Pemprov Sumut sejak 2015. Menurut Penjabat (Pj) Gubernur Sumut, Hassanudin, Opini WTP merupakan sebuah kewajiban bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk standarisasi laporan keuangan, akuntabilitas, dan kepatuhan pada undang-undang. Dia berharap, ini menjadi budaya bagi Pemprov Sumut dan menjadi motivasi untuk meningkatkan kinerja. \"Ini bukan prestasi, ini merupakan keharusan bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk tanggung jawab kita mengelola uang rakyat. Saya harap ini menjadi budaya di Pemprov Sumut dan meningkatkan motivasi kerja. \" kata Hassanudin, seusai penyerahan Laporan Hasil Pemeriksaan (LHP) RI di Ruang Rapat Paripurna DPRD Sumut, Jalan Imam Bonjol Nomor 5, Medan, Senin (27/5). Hassanudin juga menegaskan, Opini WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras Pemprov Sumut dalam pengelolaan keuangan daerah. Walau begitu, hal yang lebih penting, menurutnya, adalah kehadiran pemerintah di tengah-tengah masyarakat. “WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras kita bersama, namun yang lebih penting lagi adalah bagaimana kita bisa meningkatkan kualitas hidup masyarakat, lewat peningkatan kesehatan, pendidikan, lapangan kerja, infrastruktur dan lainnya,” kata Hassanudin. Anggota V BPK RI Ahmadi Noor Supit mengapresiasi capaian Pemprov Sumut yang berhasil meraih WTP ke-10 berturut-turut. Ahmadi mendorong agar Pemprov Sumut mengambil langkah lebih konkret untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat. “Tidak hanya fokus WTP, tetapi juga meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat terutama stunting, 18,9% masih lebih rendah dari nasional tetapi perlu dikejar hingga 14%, infrastruktur jalan, tuan rumah PON 2024 dan Pilkada serentak,” kata Ahmadi. Dia juga berharap Pemprov Sumut segera menyelesaikan rekomendasi BPK RI untuk LPKD 2023. Sampai saat ini pemprov Sumut telah menyelesaikan 81,72% rekomendasi BPK RI, melebihi target nasional yang sebesar 75%. “Sudah melebihi target nasional 75%, tetapi kita harap segera diselesaikan rekomendasi tersebut agar tidak menjadi beban pada Gubernur selanjutnya,” kata Ahmadi. Hadir pada penyerahan LHP BPK RI ini Ketua DPRD Sumut Sutarto, Auditor Utama Keuangan Negara BPK RI Slamet Kurniawan, Sekda Pemprov Sumut serta Forkopimda Sumut.

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — An industry-first study by global ecommerce accelerator, Pattern, has shown that despite their surging popularity, Australian consumers hold negative views on the quality of the products sold on emerging marketplaces Temu and Shein. The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers’ perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. “Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn’t rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,” said Merline McGregor , General Manager of Pattern Australia. “With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells. This is an area where Amazon leads the sector at 58%, with eBay trailing at 39%, followed by Catch (25%), Kogan (19%) and MyDeal (11%).” Marketplaces attract shoppers as cost-of-living pressures bite As cost-of-living pressures rise, Australian consumers are increasingly turning to marketplaces to research, compare, and purchase. A large majority of Australians shopped on a marketplace in 2023, with a staggering 94% planning to buy from platforms like Amazon, Catch, and eBay over the coming year. “With strained household budgets, marketplaces are attracting an increasing number of shoppers with their easy-to-use price comparison functionalities and sales events. With its globally recognised Prime Day event gaining popularity in Australia , Amazon has become the leading marketplace for value-for-money purchases, attracting 48% shoppers, followed by eBay at 41% and Catch at 27%,” said McGregor. Not only are marketplaces attracting higher volumes of shoppers, but they are more likely to secure high income shoppers in 2024. Today, over 80% of $200K earning households shop on Amazon. Even newer marketplaces like Shein attract high income consumers, with 34% of those in the $160 – $199k household income bracket buying from the platform in the past 12 months. Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon’s Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform’s advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia , 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process – significantly more compared to any other single marketplace. Brands need to be present on platforms with biggest product ranges Just over 60% of Australian shoppers believe Amazon has the widest product range, followed by eBay at 52%. All other platforms lagged – Catch, 20%, Temu, 17%, Kogan 14%, Shein, 11% and MyDeal 8%. Offering the most product variety and options also buys marketplaces the highest web clicks, with Amazon averaging 75.2 million monthly site visits and eBay 50.9 million. “It’s no surprise there’s a direct correlation between marketplaces perceived to have the best product ranges and those platforms, like Amazon, that attract the highest volumes of web traffic. Brands need to be present where their shoppers are. While the larger marketplaces may have more competition, they also have the biggest audiences of potential shoppers to target,” concluded McGregor.

Responses were collected online, and the survey was restricted to adults who had shopped online in the previous 12 months ensuring there was a representative sample of age, gender and location achieved.

        "content": "Australians are being promised new federal measures to protect women from domestic violence after a series of horrific attacks, with leading feminist Anne Summers warning about the growing problem as she joins an expert panel to advise on solutions. In a statement on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese formally announced the panel to conduct a rapid review into best-practice prevention approaches to combat violence against women. The panel will be co-convened by the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence commissioner, Micaela Cronin, the executive director of the Commonwealth Office for Women, Padma Raman, and the secretary of the Department of Social Services, Ray Griggs. Alongside Summers, the panel includes author and educator Jess Hill, University of Melbourne research fellow Zac Seidler, diversity and inclusion consultant Todd Fernando, RMIT Centre for Innovative Justice associate director Elena Campbell and Victoria Police assistant commissioner Leigh Gassner. Speaking to this masthead, Summers said the increase in technology-enabled abuse was “really quite horrific”. Read more here. The clock is ticking for students camped at the Australian National University as a police deadline to vacate the area by noon approaches and those refusing to leave risk further action. Police told the protesters on Monday they could continue to protest but that it had to be at another location. “Your current position is situated within the primary fire evacuation zone for the Kambri precinct,” the police said. “Non-compliance with this direction by 12pm [on Tuesday] may result in further action by ACT Police.” Yesterday, those at the camp said they would hold on as they prepared to spend another night in tents amid chilly temperatures. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the “genocide in Gaza” and cut academic ties with Israel. The escalation at ANU follows news of other camps at the University of Melbourne and Curtin University in Western Australia packing up and going home. AAP Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

It was a vinyl copy of Ye's fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The person had autographed \"**** ADIDAS\" and \"YE\" in February when the Grammy winner was on a Paris tour. After the signature, his video went viral leading many offers for the vinyl. This, convinced him, to put on athe auction block Moment in Time. According to TMZ , the starting asking price of the piece is over $500,000. To put things in context, Kanye was having a public meltdown against his former business partner, and the signed copy came at that time. Since Adidas cut ties with the Power rapper in 2022 over his unacceptable behaviour—the relationship between them remains tense. Previously, he lashed out at the German apparel giant for what he claimed were the 350 designs that they were selling. \"Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys. I never made these color ways; I'm not getting paid off of them, and adidas is suing me,\" he ranted on Instagram.

The Netflix star meanwhile shed light on the pitfalls of AI saying the ads \"selling skincare that I know nothing about\" using manipulated photos of her face covered in \"wrinkles,\" adding, \"It's really scary,\" noting, \"Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.\" However, Jennifer said her forthcoming film does a decent job of representing both pros and cons of the tech. \"I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities. These movies that are talking about AI — especially this one — do a really good job of showing both sides.\" Atlas is available on Netflix to stream.",

For more insights on the forecast market size and historic data (2017 - 2021) - The fast food market in the US experienced growth in 2022, with an increase of 1,183 outlets, reaching a total of 197,163 outlets. Urbanization and a larger white-collar population fueled this expansion. Diverse consumer preferences for various food types, such as baked goods and hot beverages, also contributed. The emergence of food carts, online ordering, and digital platforms further shaped the market. Urbanization led to an increase in convenience foods, on-the-go snacks, and meal kits. Supply-chain disruptions and labor restraints posed challenges, while healthy food options, protein choices, and international cuisines emerged as trends. • The fast food market is characterized by trends such as food carts, online ordering, and consumer preferences for convenience and urbanization. Supply-chain disruptions and labor restraints influence business models, including cloud kitchens and fast-casual restaurants. Consumers spend on various food offerings, including snacking habits, seafood, burgers, and protein options. • Urban populations favor Mexican food and international cuisines, while franchises and restaurants expand their menus with meal kits and ready-to-eat meals. Chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes are concerns due to junk food consumption, leading to increased demand for healthy alternatives. Keywords: consumer spending, digital platforms, urbanization, convenience foods, on-the-go snacks, labor restraints, cloud kitchen business, meal kits, ready-to-eat meals, chronic diseases. Research report provides comprehensive data on impact of trend, driver and challenges - In the dynamic fast food market, product segmentation plays a pivotal role in catering to diverse consumer preferences. Food carts and online ordering platforms have gained traction, allowing consumers to access a wide range of non-vegetarian offerings from the comfort of their homes or on-the-go. Urbanization and digital platforms have fueled the demand for fast-food franchises, restaurants, and meal kits, particularly among millennial consumers with disposable income. Consumer spending on snacking habits, seafood, burgers, and protein options has driven the growth of the market. The fast-casual restaurant sector, with its focus on healthy foods and innovative sandwich toppings, has emerged as a significant player. International cuisines, such as Mexican food and Chinese food, have also gained popularity. Supply-chain disruptions and labor restraints have necessitated the rise of cloud kitchen businesses and distribution networks. The trend towards convenient, ready-to-eat meals and on-the-go snacks has been further accentuated by lockdown restrictions and the shift towards full-service restaurants offering pick-up orders and food delivery services. Consumer spending on junk food consumption, despite the rise of chronic diseases, remains robust.

        "description": "‘I have already signed the documents that will enable the first French instructors to visit our training centres shortly,’ said Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s top commander.",
        "content": "Ukraine’s top commander on Monday said he had signed paperwork allowing French military instructors to visit Ukrainian training centres soon. “I am pleased to welcome France’s initiative to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian servicemen,” Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Telegram after talks via video link with French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu. “I have already signed the documents that will enable the first French instructors to visit our training centres shortly and familiarise themselves with their infrastructure and personnel,” Syrskyi said. Syrskyi gave no further details but said he believed that France’s determination would encourage other partners to join this “ambitious project”. Ukraine’s Defence Ministry in a “clarification” issued later on X said Kyiv had been expressing interest in a project receiving foreign instructors since February. “As of now, we are still in discussions with France and other countries on this issue,” it said. France’s defence ministry said in a statement: “As already mentioned several times, training on Ukrainian soil is one of the projects discussed since the conference on support for Ukraine convened by the President of the Republic on February 26. “Like all the projects discussed at that time, this track continues to be the subject of work with the Ukrainians, in particular to understand their exact needs.” “We can’t take for granted the foundations on which we have built our European way of living and our role in the world,” the two leaders wrote in a joint op-ed for the Financial Times newspaper. Macron also put his name to Scholz’s idea of a “Zeitenwende”, the word used by the chancellor to describe the historic shift in Germany’s attitude to defence, which has seen it massively boost military spending following the invasion of Ukraine. “Looking back at the challenges over the last five years – be it the pandemic, the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine or increasing geopolitical shifts – it is clear: Europe is experiencing its Zeitenwende,” the leaders wrote. Among the elements put forward by Macron and Scholz were the need to deepen the EU’s single market, and boost investment, while reducing the bloc’s dependence on trading partners for key supplies. The joint mission statement comes after a period of marked tensions between the leaders of the EU’s two biggest powers. The French and German leaders will meet in person on Tuesday in Meseberg, close to Berlin, for a joint Franco-German meeting of ministers on the third day of Macron’s Germany visit. Also on Monday, Russian air defence units downed a drone outside Moscow, said Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov. Vorobyov, writing on Telegram, said fragments from the downed drone landed on a private house at about 9pm local time in Balashikha, just east of the capital. Those inside the house escaped unharmed. The Russian Defence Ministry reported that air defence units had destroyed a “small-scale airborne object”. Tass news agency, quoting aviation services, said aircraft had been temporarily directed away from flight paths northeast of Moscow but airports in the Moscow region were later reported to be operating normally.",

Research published by LawnStarter ranked the filthiest metros across the country, taking into account factors such as air quality, infrastructure problems, and the number of pests scurrying around in people's homes. Its findings showed Houston, Texas , is now the dirtiest city in the US after overtaking Newark, New Jersey, from last year. Newark, which is across the Hudson River from New York City , still ranked in second place. And while the Big Apple didn't claim the number one spot, it did secure 12th place. Your browser does not support iframes. Houston surpassed Newark as the dirtiest city in 2023, largely due to issues with pollution and cockroach infestations Across the 152 cities that were analyzed, Houston was the third most polluted overall and had the third worst greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities. The city of 2.3 million also has the biggest cockroach problem, according to data LawnStarter' s sister site PestGnome pulled from the Census Bureau. Southern states in general appear to have far more cockroach-infested homes as San Antonio, Texas and Tampa, Florida rounded out the top three. And Americans terrified of mice or rats should steer clear of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore, which were the top three cities for rodents to populate in homes. California also had a number of bad showings on the list despite its billions of dollars of spending to clean up homeless shelters over the last five years . By comparison, San Francisco spent a record $72.5 million on street cleaning in 2019 and has been ranked among the cleaner half of cities in the US. Since then, the street cleaning division of the city's Department of Public Works received a $16.7 million budget increase in 2023, CBS reported. The Golden Gate Bridge tower with San Francisco cityscape in the background Afternoon view of the downtown skyline of San Bernardino, California, which was the fourth dirtiest city in America due to its poor air quality. Many other cities in the Golden State have bad air quality from pollution Ontario, California is pictured from overhead. The city is tied with San Bernadino for the worst air quality in the country Riverside, California, also has the worst air quality in the country alongside Ontario and San Bernadino. All three cities are east of Los Angeles and near many factories and warehouses San Bernadino, colloquially known as the ' armpit ' of California among locals, was the fourth dirtiest city mostly because of its poor air quality. Riverside and Ontario, which are also in the Los Angeles metro area, were tied with San Bernardino for the worst air quality in the country. These LA adjacent cities, once filled with orange groves and grape vineyards, have largely been replaced with pollution-heavy warehouses. About 1 billion square feet of warehouse space to be exact, The Verge reported in 2022. Residents of San Bernadino were the most dissatisfied with the cleanliness of their city for the second year in a row, according to data from the study. The LawnStarter study also claimed the southwestern US had problems with drinking water contamination. 'Except for Salt Lake City, every Southwest city we ranked violated the Safe Drinking Water Act at least once in 2020, the year of the most recent EPA data,' according to the study. Las Vegas - the 19th dirtiest overall - had the most unsafe water in the southwest. Las Vegas had the most unsafe water in the southwestern US, according to the study Salt Lake City, Utah, was the only city in the southwest that didn't have major drinking water violations in 2020, per the most recent EPA data Virginia Beach, Virginia was ranked the cleanest city in the US. It was tied with three other cities in California and New Jersey for having the fewest greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities per capita However, the most obvious image that comes to mind when one thinks of a dirty city is littering. Interestingly, the authors of the study claim that Ohioans specifically has a unique habit of flicking their used cigarettes on the ground. Local media in northeast Ohio has picked up on the sheer amount of discarded cigarette butts in the state, with cleveland.com reporting on information campaigns back in 2021 to discourage people from littering. Five Ohio cities that LawnStarter ranked were among localities with the highest share of smokers in the US. Many cities that were close to water in California, Virginia and North Carolina were the cleanest on the list. Virginia Beach, Virginia was ranked the cleanest city in the US, though the study said being on the coast isn't the end all be all to having a metro free of waste. In fact, inland cities such as Fremont, California and Winston-Salem, North Carolina were also among the most immaculate.

Podcast By Adam Shergold Published: 22:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:06, 27 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments Erik ten Hag flew off on his summer holidays on Sunday having guided Manchester United to an unexpected FA Cup win to end a troubled season on a note of optimism. But the Dutchman might be advised to keep his phone switched on with INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe poised to make a decision on his future at Old Trafford. Ten Hag did everything he could to persuade United's part-owners to keep him on for a third season with a tactical masterclass to stun Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. However, INEOS won't judge him on just that one performance - however impressive - and that is where Ten Hag is in serious trouble. It's been a dreadful campaign for United, who finished a lowly eighth in the Premier League - their worst performance since 1990 - and missed out on Europe until Saturday's win.

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify They also failed miserably in the Champions League , bombing out of Europe before Christmas , and in their defence of the Carabao Cup won in Ten Hag's first season. The FA Cup offered some salvation but it's already public knowledge that INEOS have held talks with four potential replacements for Ten Hag as they audit the season. Read More Erik ten Hag faces an anxious wait to discover whether his FA Cup victory will be enough to save his job at Man United... after club chiefs held talks with potential replacements Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Frank, Roberto De Zerbi and Kieran McKenna are the names in contention and each candidate brings different qualities and pedigree. Mail Sport runs the rule over the advantages and disadvantages of the quartet. Thomas Tuchel The case FOR INEOS are big on things like 'best in class' and 'impressive pedigree' when it comes to key personnel and Tuchel would certainly tick a lot of boxes as they strive to elevate United back to the elite. The German has coached leading clubs Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, achieving some noteworthy success. He guided Chelsea to an unexpected Champions League triumph in 2021 a year after taking Paris Saint-Germain to the final, and has won league titles in France and Germany. Thomas Tuchel is available after leaving Bayern Munich and has a proven track record The German guided Chelsea to an unexpected Champions League triumph back in 2021 United won't be in the Champions League next season but with Tuchel at the helm there would be the feeling they'd soon be back. His CV gives him gravitas because it's a proven track-record of creating winning teams at the highest level of European football. Tuchel is known for his tactical versatility and likes to innovate, which would keep United's players on their toes. But good luck to those who don't carry out his instructions - they'd certainly hear about it. He would instil discipline - as Ten Hag has sought to do - and would have little patience with those who step out of line and cause issues. Sometimes he can overstep the mark, however, as we'll come to. He seems to be the ultimate 'you didn't realise what you had until it's gone' figure. PSG haven't reached another Champions League final since he left, Chelsea have certainly regressed since Todd Boehly dumped him and there were reports Bayern tried to get him to stay after getting rid. Tuchel's vision to take Chelsea forward didn't align with that of the club's new ownership The case AGAINST Bayern's performance this season, as they were blown away by Bayer Leverkusen domestically and chucked away a Champions League final as they lost to Real Madrid, was a blot on the copybook. Read More It would now seem MAD to sack Erik ten Hag: OLIVER HOLT explains why this FA Cup final is different to Louis van Gaal's Wembley last hurrah When things unravel with Tuchel, it tends to happen quickly and often explosively, with a great deal of friction between him and his bosses - and the players. He is a man who needs to get his way, including on transfers, and his vision would need to be perfectly aligned with that of Ratcliffe from the outset. At PSG, he clashed with sporting director Leonardo over recruitment and claimed he 'felt more like a politician than a coach' at the Parc des Princes. Boehly arrived at Chelsea and splashed tens of millions but you wonder how much say Tuchel actually had. It quickly emerged he disagreed with the club's direction in the market and the writing was on the wall. Tuchel can be abrasive if things don't go his way, which causes issues with players and owners His pragmatic approach at Bayern grated with many of the players but he claimed he was forced into conservative tactics because the hierarchy didn't sign his transfer targets. With INEOS assembling a new structure to guide recruitment at United, the potential for friction with Tuchel would be ever-present if he didn't get his way. Mauricio Pochettino The case FOR Read More Mauricio Pochettino has long been overlooked by Man United since his 'dream' lunch with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2016... now, with Erik ten Hag's future hanging by a thread, the Argentine is closing in on his Old Trafford destiny Mauricio Pochettino is a great believer in the 'energy of the universe' and maybe the stars are aligning for him to become Manchester United manager at last. The Argentine has been considered for the job several times in the past, most recently in 2022 when he was overlooked for Ten Hag. Now, following his departure from Chelsea after just one season, he may be able to become ringmaster at another circus straight away. The heartfelt reactions of some Chelsea players to Pochettino's departure gives a measure of the man - he is an easy guy to like and loves nothing more than working with footballers to improve their game. At United, he wouldn't want to stray into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer-style chumminess but after the abrasion of Ten Hag, Pochettino would be like a soothing balm for the dressing room. Mauricio Pochettino walked away from Chelsea last week and could finally get the United job Whether that gets results is another matter entirely, but Pochettino did ultimately emerge from the chaos at Chelsea with his reputation intact. It was a tough situation. After a couple of near-misses at Tottenham, he did gets some trophies on his CV at PSG, although that could be football's equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. The Argentine's man management skills are well-known and admired There's no doubt Pochettino's charisma could be a much-needed galvanising factor at Old Trafford as they embark on the INEOS era and you sense he'd slot in well with Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox. He is devoted to playing attractive and attacking football - ticking another box - and his record of bringing through young talents will play well with the United faithful. The case AGAINST The main reservation about Pochettino is that he doesn't have the same proven track record of winning trophies as Tuchel. He may have guided Tottenham to a Champions League final in 2019 but they were well-beaten by Liverpool. His Chelsea team should have beaten Liverpool in this season's Carabao Cup final but ended up losing. Can Pochettino get his teams over the line when it matters? A lot also depends on whether Ratcliffe demands success straight away or is willing to give the next manager time to build United up again. Pochettino would likely need three to four years to get a United team in his image fully firing - would the ownership or the fanbase have that patience? Pochettino took Tottenham to the 2019 Champions League final - but they lost to Liverpool As Ten Hag has found out, all United manager are expected to build for the long-term and show progress, while winning enough games in the here and now. But if that is a genuine concern, then it comes back to the fundamental question of why dispense with Ten Hag two years into his project to rip it up and start again? Thomas Frank The case FOR United have witnessed first-hand just how effective Thomas Frank's Brentford are. Read More EXCLUSIVE Roberto De Zerbi is a surprise candidate for the Man United job if Erik ten Hag is sacked - joining Kieran McKenna, Thomas Frank, Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino on the shortlist Last season, they were thrashed 4-0 in west London in Ten Hag's second game in charge and this season they needed two stoppage time goals from Scott McTominay to beat the Bees at Old Trafford. In the return game at the Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford came back to steal a point even though Mason Mount scored in the 96th minute. Danish coach Frank is rightly respected for the outstanding job he's done at Brentford, guiding them into the Premier League and then keeping them there for three seasons. Brentford play tactically shrewd football and have bloodied the noses of the Premier League's big boys on countless occasions. They may have a modest budget by Premier League standards but Frank, like everyone at Brentford, knows how to work smartly. Thomas Frank has succeeded in establishing Brentford as a Premier League outfit Everything is data-driven and that has led to some clever recruitment with Brentford widely acknowledged to be one of the best-run clubs in English football. All this would definitely appeal to INEOS, who would be interested in any ideas for marginal gains Frank can bring. Frank is a likeable, intelligent and eloquent guy who clearly has an excellent rapport with his players. Also in the frame for the vacant Chelsea job, it seems only a matter of time before Frank gets his chance at a bigger Premier League club. The case AGAINST At 50, Frank is still a relatively young coach but he doesn't have that ready-made experience of coaching one of the bigger clubs - unlike Tuchel and Pochettino. He doesn't have experience of managing the egos of a really elite dressing room and all the problems that come with that. Frank's Bees have stung United before, including with a 4-0 win early last season (pictured) The harmony evident at Brentford would be trickier to replicate at Old Trafford. As David Moyes discovered in 2013, you can have a very good record at a mid-ranking Premier League club like Everton and be well-regarded, but Manchester United are a very different beast. Is Frank ready for the glare of the United spotlight, the brutal scrutiny of his every decision and the sheer global enormity of the club? You just can't know how you'd cope with all that pressure until you're actually there. Kieran McKenna The case FOR Read More Kieran McKenna is a smart man. So why would he get involved in the risky business of the nutters at Man United and Chelsea? Undoubtedly the man of the moment in English football coaching. McKenna has transformed Ipswich Town from a middling League One side to a proud Premier League club again with back-to-back promotions. Since taking charge of his first game at Portman Road in December 2021, no club in the top four tiers of English football have won more league points than Ipswich's 237. Only Manchester City have scored more than their 222 goals. This hasn't gone unnoticed with McKenna linked to Chelsea, United and Brighton in recent days. A return to United would be the romantic choice. The Northern Irishman is a lifelong Red and coached in their academy before serving on the staff for Jose Mourinho and then Solskjaer. Kieran McKenna has guided Ipswich from League One to the Premier League in two seasons The 38-year-old has impressed at Portman Road and has been linked to United and Chelsea McKenna knows how things work at Old Trafford and fully grasps the expectations. Solskjaer described him as 'the most thorough and analytical, step-by-step, process-driven coach that I've worked with' and you can imagine the INEOS panel murmuring in approval. His Ipswich side play eye-catching football and have good collectivism, meaning they finished above clubs with vastly bigger budgets to clinch automatic promotion. In appointing a 38-year-old coach, United's new co-owners may feel they're tapping into a trend of younger coaches who bring fresh ideas, have no baggage and aren't afraid to think outside the box. The case against The obvious argument against McKenna is his lack of top-level experience, even if he knows United inside out. With all due respect to Ipswich, United are a world removed and the pressure could cause such an inexperienced coach to crumble very quickly. McKenna has many years ahead of him in management and though he will have personal ambitions, he'd be well advised not to take the United job now. Given the club is one never-ending soap opera, McKenna could very easily find himself chewed up and spat out within a few months, damaging his reputation. McKenna was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching staff at Old Trafford and knows United There are far safer bets for gaining Premier League experience than United, that's for sure. ROBERTO DE ZERBI The case for Mail Sport revealed on Monday that former Brighton coach De Zerbi is another candidate for the United job should Ten Hag be fired. The Italian, 44, worked wonders at Brighton after replacing Chelsea-bound Graham Potter early last season, guiding them to a sixth-place finish and European football for the first time. United were on the receiving end as Brighton beat Ten Hag's side both home and away in the Premier League, while they needed penalties to squeeze past the Seagulls into the FA Cup final. De Zerbi has emerged as another potential Ten Hag replacement after leaving Brighton This season hasn't been as momentous with Brighton finishing 11th, but they did show their swagger in a 3-1 win at Old Trafford back in September, the kind of result that barely raises an eyebrow nowadays. Despite this, plenty of bigger clubs have come knocking for De Zerbi's services and United would be up against Chelsea and potentially others if they try to hire him. De Zerbi certainly doesn't want for passion - which can be a double-edged sword - but he has proven with Brighton he can mastermind effective and tactically clever football in the Premier League. As Mail Sport reported on Sunday, United would have to pay compensation to Brighton but it's only around £5million. De Zerbi would be like an electric shock around Old Trafford but we don't really know if he's capable of building a long-term project or winning major silverware. Ten Hag's United beat De Zerbi's Brighton 2-0 on the final day of the Premier League season The case against It didn't take too much reading between the lines of De Zerbi's Brighton exit statement to discover the true reasons for his departure. He'd not been shy in criticising Brighton's hierarchy over recruitment and you sense he might be on the same collision course if he came to United. The Italian isn't someone happy to simply leave transfers to a committee, they have to fit his tactical structure. How much power would Ratcliffe, Ashworth and Co be willing to cede? Like Frank and McKenna, De Zerbi is also untested at the very top level of football and offers no guarantees of success, let alone the instant success everyone at United craves.

The Labour leader said the July 4 vote amounted to a choice about 'whose side are you on' as he introduced himself to the nation after four years in opposition. Vowing to deliver economic stability and protect national security 'in service of the British people', he claimed he was 'progressive'. This is despite abandoning several Left-wing pledges he ran on when challenging for the party leadership. Sir Keir, 61, also dismissed accusations from senior Tory sources that he lacked the 'stamina' to handle an election by claiming Labour has been in campaign mode since he became leader in 2020. Keir Starmer declared he is a 'socialist' yesterday as he hit back at claims of being 'Sir Sleepy' during the election campaign At his first keynote speech at Lancing in West Sussex, the Labour leader said the July 4 vote amounted to a choice about 'whose side are you on' as he introduced himself to the nation after four years in opposition In a speech which centred on his personal motivation in politics rather than policy, Sir Keir accused ministers of failing to understand the lives of voters outside major cities In a speech which centred on his personal motivation in politics rather than policy, Sir Keir accused ministers of failing to understand the lives of voters outside major cities.

'Everything I have fought for has been shaped by my life, every change I have made to this party has been about a cause, the answer to that question, the only answer: the working people of this country delivering on their aspirations, earning their respect, serving their interests.' The de facto campaign launch took place in the West Sussex constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham, where Labour will look to hunt down the Tory majority of 7,474. Separately in an interview with the BBC, when asked if was a socialist, Sir Keir said: 'Yes, I would describe myself as a socialist. I describe myself as a progressive. I'd describe myself as somebody who always puts the country first and party second.' But last night senior Conservatives accused Sir Keir of failing to offer any substance.

In this wearisome and rambling speech, there was no policy, no substance and no plan.' Party figures have been keen to point out that Sir Keir – who is 17 years older than Mr Sunak – may not have what it takes to fight a gruelling six-week campaign. One official even took a lead from Donald Trump's jibes at President Joe Biden and labelled him 'Sir Sleepy'. But Sir Keir said: 'I think they're just so desperate. 'We've had a strategy, we've had a plan that we've worked on for this election for four-and-a-half years. We're executing our plan and our strategy. 'I've had a smile on my face since January 1, 2024 because I knew this was going to be an election year. Responding to the Labour leader, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: 'Not a single plan for the future.

'But what I'm doing now is humbly asking voters to trust us to change the country. 'None of our plans require us to increase taxes. Working people have been overburdened with increased taxes. 'We have gone through all of our plans, and none of them require us to raise taxes.'

Al-Ittihad, featuring former Chelsea star N'Golo Kante and ex-Liverpool midfielder Fabinho , looked to fight back with two goals near the end of the match but were unable to undo the damage done by Ronaldo and Co. The evening was all about Ronaldo as his outstanding performance saw the 39-year-old continue his usual career trend of breaking new records.

Meanwhile, his latest efforts also means Ronaldo is now the first-ever player to be a top scorer in four different leagues. Ronaldo's first top scoring season came in England when his performances at Man United during the club's 2007/08 Champions League winning season saw him awarded the Premier League's golden boot. The Portugal captain matched Alan Shearer's 38-game record that year by finding the back of the net 31 times, before moving to Real Madrid just over a year later. His nine-years in the Spanish capital saw Ronaldo battle back-and-forth with Lionel Messi for the LaLiga top scoring gong, and got the better of the ex-Barcelona star on three occasions.

        "content": "I went to a job interview hoping for the best, but was left absolutely shocked by the hiring manager’s incredibly ‘woke’ act before we had even started Hiring manager performed Welcome to Country at job interview READ MORE: Aboriginal leaders call out constant Welcome to Countries By Olivia Day For Daily Mail Australia Published: 22:04 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:04 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments An Aussie applying for a customer service role at an insurance company was left shocked after the hiring manager opened the interview with a Welcome to Country. The applicant shared the 'weird' experience on Reddit , saying the hiring manager at the Brisbane-based company 'took it upon himself' to perform a Welcome to Country at the start of a 'very small' group interview with less than five candidates. 'I wanted to get others' opinions on this as I thought it was peak Australian corporate culture,' the candidate wrote on Friday. 'At the time I didn't give it a second thought but in retrospect it's pretty weird and unnecessary. 'I understand companies doing these for big/important meetings with higher-ups, but at a job interview it just felt pointless.' A candidate for a customer service role at a Brisbane insurance company was left confused after the hiring manager opened the meeting with a Welcome to Country (stock image) A Welcome to Country can only be delivered by Traditional Owners or Custodians of the land on which the event takes place. It is usually performed by a local Aboriginal Elder to acknowledge and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands. If a Traditional Owner is not available to do a Welcome to Country, an Acknowledgement of Country can be delivered instead. Aussies were quick to share their thoughts, with many agreeing the Welcome to Country had been unnecessary at the job interview. 'I'd say I'm a pretty progressive guy in terms of Aboriginal rights, don't mind a Welcome to Country at a formal or sporting event,' one man wrote. 'However I think Acknowledgement of Country in the workplace for anybody below the CEO (and even then) is the most cringey load of bull**** of all time.' 'Cringe. Did he get up and sing the National Anthem too? Stinks of virtue signalling,' a second commented. 'Do that s*** and I am walking right back out the door,' a third said. 'Interview be damned. I'm not going to work somewhere full of virtue-signalling woke leftist bobble-heads.' A fourth shared: 'It feels pointless to me at every meeting'. Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is seen performing a Welcome to Country at the A-League Women Grand Final match between Melbourne and Sydney on May 4 Others shared their own experiences of the Aboriginal ceremony. 'I went to a function the Labor Party threw for small businesses to meet a number of Federal MPs,' one person wrote. 'Not only was there a 20 minute Welcome to Country, literally every speaker spent a few minutes doing an Acknowledgement of Country before speaking. 'It's reaching a f****ing bizarre level of performative quasi-religious theatre.' 'I had a photography award night with my local council EVERY person who spoke acknowledged and welcomed... made me not want to participate again just say it once and move on,' a second said. A third shared: 'My experience has been that any meeting I've had that involves HR or similar, will almost always include an Acknowledgement to Country. They seem to take it very seriously, often more so then the 'purpose' of the meeting.' An Acknowledgement of Country is a way to show awareness and respect for Traditional Custodians of the land where a meeting or event is taking place. Its purpose is to recognise the continuing connection of Aboriginal people to Country, and can be delivered by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

        "content": "The Sri Mala Malleswara Swami Kshetram, a temple located on a hill in the Devaragattu forests of Holagunda mandal in Kurnool district, has a fascinating history. Following Dussehra, the temple deity’s celestial event of ‘Kalyanam’ will be celebrated, during which a traditional stick-fighting procession takes place. The Banni Utsav in Devaragattu has become known as ‘Karrala Samaram’, a battle of sticks, although the devotees view it as a tradition rather than a battle. Over the decades, the festival has gained immense significance. In Andhra Pradesh, the Devaragattu Banni festival has been included in the Class X Telugu curriculum. The festival has been incorporated into the new Class X syllabus for the academic year 2024-25. This lesson covers the stick-fighting tradition during the Banni Utsav. It is expected to provide the students an opportunity to learn more about and appreciate this unique festival. The decision to include this festival in the curriculum was taken by the Education Department to ensure that every student is aware of this cultural celebration.

But last September, ahead of a scheduled tee time, the 56-year-old learnt of a battle that changed his life. “It was a nagging cough I had during last summer for probably a month-and-a-half or so, and just kind of kept getting a little worse,” Blake said. “I was scheduled to play golf on this one Friday and was all dressed and ready to go, and just that morning felt like a little bit worse than it has been. “I said, ‘Alright, let’s get in a car,’ (and I) drove to the hospital instead of the golf course, thinking that hopefully we’ll just get in and out of there, who knows, and still make tee time.” Story continues below advertisement Sixteen hours later, Blake was sitting in the emergency room and was given the news he had Stage 4 lung cancer. “It’s one of those things that’s a life-changer for not only you, but your family, your community.” 5:33 Alberta lung cancer screening program expands The golfer was given a prognosis of 12 to 24 months by his oncologist.

We asked Emma to guide us through ten of the songs that changed her life. From a ska punk icon to some hardcore heroes and a truly game-changing rap superstar, her picks turned out to be as varied as they are excellent. Here's what she came up with. “I heard the band , and it was a defining moment for me. The song inspired our song – especially the bridge and the hook into the end breakdown, and the ‘I despise the drinking father’ aspect [ features the lyric, ‘just a broken old man broken by the whiskey’]. When I was a kid, that song resonated with me because of what I was going through [with my alcoholic stepfather]. “I love by ! I’ve listened to since I was seven – my mom was a huge indie rock kid. When we drove to my grandparents’ house three hours away, was one of the CDs we would have on repeat. It was the first time I’d ever heard a woman in a rock band, and Gwen Stefani is such an icon. “ s is kind of a memoir, and it was pretty unique for bands at that time to write the way they did about the topic of grief, Howard Jones singing his heart out the way he did. The first time I ever heard them, I was 13, and it was on , but I didn’t properly appreciate them until six or seven years ago. “I had this roommate when I was 18 or 19; she disappeared completely, left half her belongings, and we never heard from her again. But she left ’s on CD, and I kind of inherited it. I remember hearing the intro to , the piano lead into Peter Steele’s really sultry voice, and I had an out-of-body experience. It was one of the first times I realised metal can bend, and it can be whatever you want it to be. “ are one of Dying Wish’s biggest influences, and especially is really influential. I saw [former vocalist] Bruce LePage write on Twitter, ‘I’m not anyone special, just a junkie who wrote some songs you like.’ That’s so real. I’m no different to anyone else in the room, I firmly believe in that. “ is my favourite song. It’s about killing someone who caused a lot of bodily harm to a woman. Jamey [Jasta, vocals] has talked a lot about how he was brought up, it’s part of the puzzle you can put together, and I really like that.

Hearing how sad she was, how much she didn’t love herself, was pained by others... but at the end it’s nothing but love. That changed the way that I walk in life. “It was hard to pick just one song by , but the album changed my life.

She’s a massive queer icon; gay people don’t get a lot of representation in country music, and she’s at the forefront of changing that. I grew up listening to some country, and moving to Nashville helped me learn to love it so much. “ s tells an incredible story, and it’s one of the only songs on the album I can listen to without crying.

        "description": "Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans is gutted that NSW captain James Tedesco has been dropped but proud of Manly teammate Jake Trbojevic for filling breach.",
        "content": "Queensland skipper Daly Cherry-Evans says the axing of former NSW captain James Tedesco \"sucks\" because he has been in the same position and understands the pain. On the flip side it is a bittersweet moment as Jake Trbojevic, his soulful, competitive Manly teammate and great friend, has become NSW skipper instead. Cherry-Evans, 35, and 30-year-old Trbojevic will go head-to-head in an old-fashioned 'mate v mate' State of Origin confrontation in Sydney on June 5 in the State of Origin series opener. \"That theme hasn't necessarily disappeared but it has been a bit hard to lean into a bit lately, without those sort of rivalries,\" Maroons half Cherry-Evans said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"But two (Origin) captains each coming from the same club is as good as it gets,\" The pair mark the first club teammates to captain opposing states since 2000, when Sydney Roosters duo Brad Fittler and Adrian Lam led NSW and Queensland. Cherry-Evans is also a good friend of Tedesco, shares the same management company, and has represented Australia alongside him. The 2011 premiership winner was dropped in 2015 from the Maroons and spent three years in the Origin wilderness. So news of 31-year-old fullback Tedesco's axing in favour of Penrith's Dylan Edwards - after Tedesco and Cherry-Evans had contested four consecutive Origin series against each other as opposition captains - hit home. \"That's hard because I have been there before. I have been dropped from Queensland and it sucks,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"There are really no words to explain it because we as footy players want to keep doing it forever and ever. \"I'm not here to say the door is shut on Teddy to play for the Blues ever again but obviously it hurts initially. \"They have ... gone with Dylan. Madge (NSW coach Michael Maguire) is obviously not afraid to make the moves that he thinks will put them in the best position. \"As a friend of Teddy's, it was definitely disappointing.\" Cherry-Evans explained his mixed emotions in a nutshell. \"Teddy gets dropped and my current teammate becomes captain. It is hard not to be really happy and proud for Jake for how hard he has worked and his perseverance as a footy player,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"He continually rocks up and plays good footy each week and it is amazing to see where he is now. He is NSW captain.\" It is why Cherry-Evans expects to face a NSW side, led by middle forward Trbojevic, that will give no quarter. \"He is a win-at-all-costs player. Jake doesn't have a good poker face,\" Cherry-Evans grinned. \"That is the best way to explain it. If (Manly) have lost, he is not happy. With the wins, he rides them just as hard as anyone else. I am really proud of Jake. He has worked so hard and been super-competitive for a long time.\" Cherry-Evans said he had texted Trbojevic \"to say congrats\" but that they wouldn't speak again before the series opener.",

        "description": "One of the keys for the Raiders this offseason will be mastering new offensive coordinator Luke Getsy’s scheme. So far, so good, according to tight end Michael Mayer.",
        "content": "Michael Mayer was diplomatic when asked about new offensive coordinator Luke Getsy. The Raiders second-year tight end was asked to explain the differences between Getsy’s scheme and the one taught by former coach Josh McDaniels last season. “It’s easier than last year,” Mayer said Tuesday after the Raiders finished an organized team activity. How so? “I’d say it’s a little bit more simple,” Mayer said. “A little bit more simple, a little bit easier to understand.” What that means for a Raiders offense that finished 27th in yards per game (289.5) and 23rd in points per game (19.5) last season remains to be seen. But a scheme that’s easier to digest could lead to a more confident, cohesive and efficient attack. There were times last year where the Raiders seemed bogged down by the complexities of McDaniels’ offense. That makes it all the more important that they pick up Getsy’s ideas as fast as possible with OTAs continuing this week. A new look Getsy joins the Raiders after spending two years as the Bears offensive coordinator. He was fired by Chicago in January after failing to maximize the team’s attack under young quarterback Justin Fields. The Raiders believe Fields was more of the problem than Getsy, who was a highly regarded offensive assistant in Green Bay before joining the Bears. Chicago also showed Fields the door as well soon after Getsy’s departure. The Bears traded him to Pittsburgh for a sixth-round pick, setting the franchise up to take Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams first overall in April’s draft. Gesty doesn’t have a settled quarterback situation with the Raiders, either. Second-year passer Aidan O’Connell and veteran Gardner Minshew are competing for the starting role this offseason. Neither is the runner Fields is, but both might be better fits for the West Coast offense Getsy is bringing to Las Vegas. The scheme is centered around quick, intermediate throws expected to be delivered with precise timing. Getsy also has a set of intriguing weapons to work with. The Raiders’ skill-position group includes wide receivers Davante Adams, Jakobi Meyers, Tre Tucker and Michael Gallup, tight ends Mayer and Brock Bowers and running back Zamir White, who should fit well with Getsy’s outside zone running scheme. Adams should be familiar with the system as well after being coached by Getsy in Green Bay. The offense has a few key components. Getsy wants to run the ball effectively. He wants to make play-action passes a staple. He wants to attack the middle of the field and take shots when available. “Yeah, I think there’s certain things that are kind of non-negotiable in your play style, right, and the mindset that you want to bring,” Getsy said. “And fortunately, I’ve been around a lot of really good football coaches that have kind of exposed me to a lot of different styles of play and different ways of approaching teams and finding different ways to attack the different styles of defense that we face each week.” Being adaptable Getsy will also be flexible depending on the situation. He showed an ability to adjust when the Raiders played the Bears on Oct. 22 last season. Fields was hurt, so backup Tyson Bagent got the start. Bagent, an undrafted free agent, led Chicago to a 30-12 victory running an offense that looked far different than the one built for Fields. Raiders coach Antonio Pierce, who was in charge of the team’s linebackers at the time, said after hiring Getsy that game built up his admiration for his new offensive coordinator. Getsy believes that kind of adaptability is just part of the job. “I mean, you could go into Week 3 thinking you have one style of roster and in Week 4, it can be completely different, right?” Getsy said. “I mean, just using that example, we had completely two different styles of QBs in Chicago. ... I think the most important thing is finding a way to maximize the type of guy that you have, figuring out what they do well and that’s the phase that we’re in right now. We’re all trying to figure each other out and figure out what we do best.” It sounds simple. So far for the Raiders, it feels that way, too. That’s why Mayer sees promise in what the team is building. “I’m very happy with the way this offense is going so far and what we’re going to be able to do on the offensive side,” Mayer said.

        "content": "PATNA: 22-year-old final-year student of Patna's B N College was beaten to death by a group of 10-15 masked assailants in the parking lot of Patna Law College , where he had come to write an exam on Monday. The deceased was identified as Harsh Kumar, son of Vaishali-based journalist Ajit Kumar. Harsh, pursuing BA English (H), was recently seen campaigning for Shambhavi Choudhary, LJP (RV) nominee from Samastipur LS seat and daughter of Ashok Choudhary, a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet. Police said he had been involved in a brawl with some Patna University students over organising a 'dandiya night' event during Dussehra last year. The attack took place at 12.45pm. The attackers cornered Harsh near the college parking and began hitting him with rods and bricks. Passersby looked on but none intervened. Harsh was rushed to Patna MCH where doctors declared him dead. City SP (east) Bharat Soni said cops were yet to ascertain the cause of the murder as well as the assailants' identities. Refusing to comment on the attack, Patna Law College principal Mohd Sharif said, \"I do not know anything.\" According to Harsh's family, he was politically active and wanted to contest the students' union elections.",

        "description": "US Central Command claims to have shot down a drone that was launched from a Houthi-controlled area in Yemen during the early Monday morning hours.",
        "content": "US Central Command said it shot down a drone over the Red Sea after it was launched from Houthi-controlled area in Yemen early Monday morning. The drone was shot out of the sky around 4 a.m. after military personnel determined that it it was hostile, according to a press release. “It was determined the [uncrewed aerial system] presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels in the region,” US Central Command said in a statement . “These actions are taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and merchant vessels.” On Monday, the Houthis claimed to have attacked two destroyers in the Red Sea as well as three ships in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, according to Reuters . The US strike comes after Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed to have downed a US MQ-9 Reaper over the province of Marib and a second US MQ-9 Reaper drone days later. Tensions between the West and the Houthi rebels, an Iranian-backed Shia Islamist political group that has sought political control over Yemen, have simmered shortly after the dawn of the Israel-Hamas war late last year. Since the war, the US has been forced to shoot down a slew of missiles and drones from the Houthis, widely regarded as one of Iran’s top proxy forces in the region. The Houthis have claimed that their attacks on Western assets are a sign of solidarity with the Palestinians. Back in January, President Biden re-listed the Houthis as a terrorist organization after delisting the group in 2021 – a reversal of a Trump administration policy. The US also conducted a wave of strikes on Houthi-backed targets earlier in the year after the Houthis wreaked havoc with critical shipping lanes.",

        "content": "ALEX BRUMMER: Copper displaces diamonds as Anglo American puts De Beers up for sale By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:00 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Diamonds have been the core of Anglo American since the modern company was created by Ernest Oppenheimer nearly a century ago. In an industry where brands stand for little, De Beers is the great exception. Its products have inspired generations of young people embarking on married life, and the gems remain the sparkling star of movies and legends. As glamorous as De Beers has been, with its arresting 1947 catchphrase ‘A diamond from a mine is forever,’ the company is now up for sale. The allure of diamonds has been surpassed by the work-a-place copper – a metal less regarded than more decorative rivals such as platinum, silver and gold. In demand: Copper prices have climbed 20% this year touching a record of $11,000-a-tonne this month The drive towards a greener, carbon-free economy has changed all of that. Copper prices have climbed 20 per cent this year touching a record of $11,000-a-tonne this month. Some traders predict a glorious future for the reddish metal with the value perhaps quadrupling to $40,000-a-tonne. There is a history of speculators seeking to making a fortune out of copper. In the 1990s Japanese bank Sumitomo lost $2.6billion (£2billion) at the hands of disgraced trader Yasuo Hamanaka. Giants of the mining world are seeking to double down on the metal. The proposed disposal of De Beers by Anglo American, as it seeks to defend itself from a three times assault by Australian mining behemoth BNP, is all about copper.

The conductivity of copper makes it critical to the world as it moves towards more electric vehicles, solar and nuclear energy. Copper mania has left De Beers and diamonds as an orphan asset in a mining world where metals are the real stars. Sparklers hold a special place in Western culture and De Beers has for decades had a granite grip on supplies. It has stood at the apex of a trade dominated by the cutters and dealers from the Hasidic Jewish community, based in Hatton Garden in London, Antwerp and Tel Aviv. A window on the occluded culture recently was offered by the Netflix series Rough Diamonds. Anglo’s going-it-alone strategy requires it to sell De Beers in the hope of raising up to £5billion through a trade sale or by doing the splits and listing the shares in London. The challenge for De Beers is how to preserve the rarity and cache of mined diamonds. Last year Anglo wrote down the value of its diamond operation by £1.3billion to £6billion as sales of its rough diamonds plummeted by 18 per cent. Sales have been hit by lower demand from The US and China. The real villain of the piece are laboratory stones. These lab diamonds are said to be virtually indistinguishable from their mined cousins and have grabbed around 20 per cent of the American market alone. Danish jeweller Pandora is among the fashion brands to embrace the newcomer, which sell for a fraction of the price of the real thing and carry less of the stigma which comes with the mined variety. De Beers itself has Lightbox, its own lab grown offshoot embraced in an effort to maintain its market control. The challenge for the next owners of De Beers is how to make its product distinguishable from the lab grown variety. One possibility is a marketing arrangement with a luxury goods group such as Tiffany or Cartier where forces could be combined to market diamonds around the idea of ‘real’ or ‘original’. The cost of such a campaign would be expensive. But it is not impossible as the surging price of hand-made Swiss watches demonstrates. Many of these high priced items have diamond enhanced movements and encrusted cases. In contrast to the struggles of diamonds the allure of copper, amid surging global demand, has never been greater.

        "content": "Jaylen Brown doesn’t appear to trust Stephen A. Smith’s sources. “It’s not so much that he’s underrated, it’s just that he’s not liked because of his I-am-better-than attitude,” Smith explained of Brown on First Take last week, reading a text message on the show from what the ESPN host described as an “NBA source.” “He knows it,” Smith continued, reading the text message. “‘It’s the same reason that he is not as marketable as he should be,’ that’s what an NBA source just sent me.” Brown replied back to the clip of Smith reading the text messages on X, writing , “State your source.” NBA legend and Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas also responded on X to Smith . “I have been a friend, mentor and advisor to @FCHWPO since he was a student at UC Berkeley he is 100 percent marketable and before you slander his name @stephenasmith tell your source to put their name on it or don’t speak on it. Let it be known.” This isnt the first time that Brown’s reputation has been called into question, too. In 2016, during the lead up to the NBA draft, Brown, who made the rare decision of entering the draft without an agent, was called “too smart for the league” by another nameless NBA executive via Andscape . Here is the video Isiah Thomas was upset at Stephen A about. He read a text from a “NBA SOURCE” that says people don’t like Jaylen Brown because he has a big ego and that’s why he’s not marketable. pic.twitter.com/oBz8ouXjwc Thomas was entrusted as a mentor to Brown during this time, instead of hiring an agent. “I am who I am. Take it or leave it,” Brown said after the report came out. “I’m not going to change my values and change my approach because someone feels uncomfortable. I am not going to be disrespectful or step on any toes. But I am going to be me.” Brown was said to be taking a graduate school-level class as a freshman at Cal, according to multiple reports at the time. “It’s not malicious,” the Andscape report continued. “He just wants to know what is going on. Old-school coaches don’t want guys that question stuff.” Brown challeneged that report two years later when asked about it at the Rising Stars Challenge. “What is the so-called mold of a basketball player?” Brown contested in Feb. 2018, via Boston.com . “I challenge whoever has the ideal or the ideology of a ‘so-called basketball player,’ I challenge them to come out and say what that is.” Brown has challenged these anonymous sources for years, but all of it has remained nameless. He’s been extremely successful since then, as the second leading scorer for Boston coming in at 24.7 points per game and having them on the brink of the team’s second NBA Finals berth in his career.",

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Will Pickworth Published: 17:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Chris Sutton has claimed people call Man City 'boring' because they win so much, rather than due to a dislike of their style of play. Since Pep Guardiola arrived at the Etihad in 2016, the Spaniard has overseen a period of dominance, with City winning 17 trophies during his tenure, including four successive Premier League titles. As a result, they have faced criticism for being 'boring', with many fans and pundits fed up of the lack of competition in England, although City did suffer a shock FA Cup final defeat to Man United at the weekend. And, speaking on Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast , Sutton said people are bored of Guardiola's side because they are 'so good' and said those that accuse them of having a 'boring' style of play are just 'jealous'. Ladyman agreed with his co-host, as he labelled City 'monsters', although he did point to the fact that some people prefer watching teams who 'get it forward quickly with a bit more crash-bang-wallop'.

        "content": "Beloved Shiba Inu dog Kabosu has passed away in its sleep after dominating the meme sector for over a decade as the face behind Dogecoin (DOGE). The crypto community is mourning the death of Kabosu as the dog had inspired the rise of several other meme coins aside from Dogecoin (DOGE). At the same time, many in the crypto community are excited about an Ethereum (ETH) token ETFswap (ETFS), whose presale event is promising early investors automatic yield. Let’s see how that is possible. ETFSwap (ETFS): A Unique ETF Trading Platform ETFswap (ETFS) is a crypto ETF trading platform that introduces a unique method of trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through the tokenization of assets. The tokenized version of the ETF will directly represent its traditional counterpart on the blockchain, giving room to closely monitor the assets before making any investment decision. The ETFs will be available for trading on a Web3 marketplace equipped with 24/7 liquidity and trading tools, which will assist traders in making the best use of the assets. One such trading tool is the ETF Filter, which will help investors save time by narrowing down their ETF choices when they apply specific parameters like asset classes, regions, and fund domicile. However, knowing which parameters to use could be hard without adequate knowledge about ETFs. That is why ETFswap (ETFS) will also introduce the ETFswap Screener, a crypto ETF index whose function is to educate users on exchange-traded funds and how to classify them accurately. At the center of ETFswap (ETFS) is its native token ETFS , a standard ERC-20 and deflationary token that will serve the purpose of utility, unlocking all the unique features on the platform, including trading tokenized ETFs. The token will also give holders voting rights to participate in the network governance. As the key to its ecosystem, ETFswap (ETFS) currently offers ETFS to all in the crypto community at a low price of $0.00854 per coin in its stage 1 presale event. By stage 2, the token price will briefly increase to $0.01831, resulting in automatic profit for all stage 1 investors. Further experts speculate that ETFS will soon surge to the $3 mark after launch and listing. Crypto Market Mourns Kabosu, The Shiba Inu Dog Behind The Dogecoin Logo Japanese Shiba Inu dog Kabosu passed away at the age of 18 on May 24, 2024, in its sleep from liver disease and leukemia, as reported by its owner, Atsuko Sako, on her blog Kabochan . Kabosu was first diagnosed with the illness in 2022 and has been struggling with it ever since. Sako had adopted Kabosu from a puppy mill in 2008, and in 2010, she took a picture of her pet spreading its paws on a sofa chair. She initially posted the photo on her blog, but it reached a Reddit forum where it became a meme circulated from office email chains to college dorm rooms. Eventually, the picture of the Shiba Inu dog became an NFT artwork and sold for $4 million, but more interestingly, it served as a stepping stone to the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE), the 8th most important cryptocurrency in the crypto market. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) founders started it as a joke, a payment system with no serious value, but it eventually evolved into a token with several use cases. Dogecoin (DOGE) has received backing from musical artists like Snoop Dogg and world-renowned billionaire Elon Musk, who has been its biggest fan. Last year, Elon changed the face of Twitter, now rebranded to X to the Dogecoin (DOGE) icon. Also, in April 2024, its EV maker company Tesla officially integrated DOGE as the payment option on its website. In November 2023, an organization dedicated to Dogecoin (DOGE) unveiled a $100,000 statue of Kabosu and her sofa at a park in Sakura, Japan. Further, Dogecoin (DOGE) cofounder Billy Markus, known on X as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has paid tribute to Kabosu in an X post on the day the iconic Shiba Inu dog passed away. Conclusion The death of Kabosu caused grief for many in the crypto community, but ETFswap (ETFS) offers consolation with its presale event, which promises automatic yield on investment and its unique method of trading ETFs.

        "content": "Czech Sphinx will cut up to 1,000 Royal Mail jobs if £3.5bn takeover goes ahead, union bosses warn By Jessica Clark Updated: 22:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Union bosses have warned the ‘Czech Sphinx’ could press ahead with plans to cut up to 1,000 posties if he succeeds in his bid to buy Royal Mail. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) is set to hold talks with the billionaire businessman Daniel Kretinsky in early June if a deal goes ahead. Kretinsky has until 5pm on Wednesday to make a firm offer for Royal Mail owner International Distribution Services (IDS) or walk away. It comes after the IDS board said it would back his £3.5billion offer, which sparked an immediate backlash from campaigners, unions and politicians. CWU director general for post Martin Walsh told the Mail: ‘We are sceptical of Royal Mail and we are sceptical of Kretinsky’s firm. We will be looking for commitments on jobs.’ Deadline: Daniel Kretinsky (pictured) has until 5pm on Wednesday to make a firm offer for Royal Mail owner IDS It comes as Kretinsky, the billionaire co-owner of West Ham United football club, has backed Royal Mail’s reform proposals, which would lead to ‘fewer than 1,000’ voluntary redundancies. These plans include cutting second-class post to three days a week, paving the way for redundancies to save around £300million a year. Kretinsky has said he would protect workers’ rights and keep the Royal Mail brand, as well as its UK base and tax residence. But he has been tight-lipped on job losses and second-class post – suggesting cuts remain on the agenda. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ALEX BRUMMER: Copper displaces diamonds as Anglo American...

Under those plans, there would be up to 9,000 fewer daily routes within two years – resulting in hundreds of job losses. The proposals would require reform of the Universal Service Obligation, which means Royal Mail has to offer a six-day-a-week service for a fixed price. IDS has urged the government and regulators to make changes, saying the obligation costs Royal Mail up to £675million a year.

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are — including , , and — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a in the state.",

        "content": "The historic Lorain-Sandusky Tornado of 1924 officially will mark its centennial June 28, but much like the event itself, the impact will be felt for months to come. Throughout the summer, the Lorain Historical Society, 329 W. 10th St. in Lorain, will host a number of events revolving around the tornado. The string of events officially will kick off June 28 with the remembrance ceremony, according to the Historical Society’s website. “This remembrance event will honor the victims and survivors of the 1924 Lorain tornado inside the Lakeview Park Bath House which was where the tornado first made landfall in Lorain,” the Historical Society said. “Directly following the event, join the Lorain County Metro Parks on a guided ‘Tornado Walking Tour’ around 1 p.m. through the park.” Later that evening, the Historical Society will host a second, smaller acknowledgement during the Lorain International Festival. Businesses and clubs around the city of Lorain have scheduled events throughout the summer to remember the victims and survivors of the tornado. To bring awareness to the subsequent rebuilding of the city, the Historical Society has partnered with businesses around the city. “To honor the 100th anniversary of the 1924 Lorain tornado, local organizations are working together to remember the victims and survivors of the tornado and promote awareness around the rebuilding and rebirth that followed,” the Historical Society said. It has supplied five Lorain-based small businesses with exclusive tornado-themed postcards in anticipation of the event. Those looking for extras can find the five card set at the Historical Society’s gift shop. “Visit the Ariel Broadway Hotel, Broadway Mary’s, Magdalen’s Gallery + Espresso, Nielsen’s Jewelers and Speak of the Devil Cocktail Bar to collect each postcard,” the website said. “We’re working together to promote the resilience of our community during that time, and now.” The Historical Society has partnered with Main Street Lorain during its Second Saturday events this summer. Also, the Historical Society will give tornado walking tours throughout each event from June to September. Additionally, this year’s annual stamp show Nov. 23, hosted by the Black River Stamp Club, will revolve around the tornado’s anniversary. Stamp enthusiasts can purchase an exclusive cachet and postmark at the show. The Historical Society also built an online database of photographs and information about the tornado which is open to the public. “Lorain Historical Society volunteers have been describing and digitizing the extensive collection of tornado photographs, postcards, and documents for the public to view and explore online,” the website said. “Volunteers have done their best to identify exact locations of images in the collection.” Currently, the Historical Society is looking for more photos and other tornado memorabilia for the online collection. Those looking to have their pieces included in the database, can visit www.lorainhistory.org/tornado-commemoration for more information.",

        "content": "GRAND FORKS — Thompson senior Brayden Wolfgram had no idea how many high school baseball games he had earned the pitching victory in during his Tommies career. However, it was easy to recall how many losses Wolfgram has earned. Zero. The 5-foot-10 right-hander takes a 16-0 career pitching record into this weekend's North Dakota Class B state baseball tournament in Jamestown. The Tommies, searching for a third-consecutive state title, open the tournament Thursday against Surrey at 11:30 a.m. ADVERTISEMENT Wolfgram would like to add one more pitching win to his record this weekend. \"That'd be pretty awesome, knowing you haven't lost a game,\" Wolfgram said. \"I've had situations like this year in Hillsboro where I could have picked up the loss but (Drew) Odenbach came in and closed it out and helped me out. \"That's part of it, too. You have to trust your teammates. I don't blow it past kids, but I trust my defense enough to make the plays. I have one of the best shortstops in the state. Trusting your defense and throwing strikes is a big part of Thompson baseball.\" Wolfgram, who's committed to play college baseball at Concordia in Moorhead next season, is 8-0 this year. In 41 innings pitched, he has 51 strikeouts and a 0.85 earned-run average. \"He's effective with where he throws it,\" Thompson coach Nate Soulis said. \"He keeps you off balance with four pitches. His fastball gets by you if you're thinking something else. Even if you're sitting fastball, he can spot it up where it'll take a good swing and a good hitter to do damage on it.\" Wolfgram has had help this year on the hill for the Tommies. Odenbach is 5-0 with 53 strikeouts in 38 innings with a 1.84 ERA. Brody Gibson is 3-0 with a 1.00 ERA across 28 innings. Wolfgram is also batting a team-high .457. Thompson's top nine hitters are all batting better than .300 on the year. \"He's taken it to another level,\" Soulis said. \"This is his fourth year starting. I don't know what his secret sauce is this year but he's confident. The teammates feel it and the coaches feel it. When he's up, you know he's going to hit it hard. When he's pitching, our guys know we have our best on the mound and history shows we have a good chance to win.\" ADVERTISEMENT This year will be an eighth-straight season (the state tournament was wiped out by COVID-19 in 2020) the Tommies will be at the state tournament. As a freshman, Wolfgram was a starter when the Tommies lost to Langdon-Edmore-Munich in the state semifinals. \"We had four or five kids on this team who were on that team,\" Wolfgram said. \"That moment ... you don't want to do that again. The last two years have been fun. We've set a pretty high standard here at Thompson, especially for baseball.\" Wolfgram said some opponents could tell Thompson's goal extended beyond the region tournament. \"Other places have said it doesn't look like we're having fun at the region tournament,\" Wolfgram said. \"That's just not our goal anymore. We've been lucky enough to set that goal for ourselves. We understand there are good teams in our region, and it's no walk-by, but you have to understand there's a bigger goal.\" Coach: Nate Soulis.

        "content": "The mother of three of the girls who were injured during a stabbing at a Braintree movie theater Saturday evening is thanking the first responders and doctors who helped her daughters. Lisa Dembowski’s daughters were among the four girls stabbed by a man inside a theater at AMC’s Braintree location in an unprovoked attack. Martha’s Vineyard resident Jared Ravizza, 26, is now being investigated as a suspect in the stabbing after being arrested in connection with a stabbing at a Plymouth McDonald’s that happened shortly after Dembowksi’s daughters were attacked. Dembow took to Facebook Monday morning to thank the police officers and firefighters who responded to the stabbing, saying that they calmed both her daughters and herself. “Our first responders are incredible people,” she wrote. Dembowski also thanked the medical team that took care of her daughters at Boston Medical Center after they were taken there by ambulance. They “went above and beyond to not only make sure [her daughters] were physically OK but made them feel safe.” “They see it all and have to be exhausted and yet were at the ready for whatever we needed. Our friends and family, the community — thank you,” she wrote. Dembowski recounted what happened during the stabbing to WCVB on Sunday , explaining that three of the girls — aged 9 to 17 — were her daughters, and the fourth was their friend. They were the only people in the theater when a man came up behind them and stabbed them — laughing the whole time. The suspect stabbed Dembowski’s oldest daughter in the back, stabbed another of her daughters in the chest and stabbed the third in the arm, she told WCVB. Braintree police said previously that all the girls’ wounds were non-life-threatening, but the mother said her children are shaken and never want to go to the movies again. “Kids are resilient, but I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night and this could happen,” she said. “Someone could just walk into a movie theater and do this with no knowledge of who they were.” AMC said in a statement to WCVB that it would be adding additional security at the theater. McDonald’s issued a statement on the Plymouth stabbing to MassLive Monday night. “We are shocked and devastated by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our crew and customers is always our top priority. We are grateful to law enforcement for their quick response in protecting our Cape Cod communities and will continue to assist them in their investigation,” the restaurant chain said.",

        "content": "Squadron Leader Mark Long was killed when the Spitfire he was flying crashed in a field near RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Police and emergency services rushed to the scene on Langrick Road in Lincolnshire just before 1.20pm on Saturday. Mr Long was declared dead at the scene. An RAF spokesperson said a temporary pause is in place while an investigation into the incident is ongoing. Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby. Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C — The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) May 25, 2024 “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” the spokesperson said. RAF Coningsby is home to the BBMF, a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. Only a few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six that belong to the BBMF. On Saturday, the Prince and Princess of Wales said on their Kensington Palace X account: “Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby. “Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C.” William was Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Coningsby from 2008 to August 2023, when he handed the role over to Kate.",

        "content": "You might have noticed that some of your neighbors have taken the month of May off from mowing their lawns. So what is behind keeping the lawnmowers in the garage in New York? That would be the \"No Mow May\" movement. Many people are trying to help the bee population across the state by skipping mowing their lawns this month so the bees have more places to pollinate. READ MORE: ARE MASSIVE \"SUMMER SNOW\" STORMS COMING TO NY? Feel Good Mornings With Dave Fields Several cities across the country joined the \"No Mow May\" movement and encouraged residents to keep their lawnmowers quiet during the month of May. Springtime is crucial to bees as it begins their life cycle. Newly emerged native bees are hungry and will look to fly from flower to flower to get nectar and pollen. READ MORE: MAY FORECASTED TO BE WARMER AND DRIER THAN NORMAL By not mowing in the month of May you are allowing floral resources that may be hard to find, to be available for the bees. By allowing your lawn and the flowers on it to grow longer and bloom, your lawn can provide the nectar and pollen to help bees in your area thrive. If you can't or don't want to go the whole month without mowing, maybe reduced the number of times you mow the lawn in the month.

        "content": "Queensland skipper Daly Cherry-Evans says the axing of former NSW captain James Tedesco \"sucks\" because he has been in the same position and understands the pain. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading On the flip side it is a bittersweet moment as Jake Trbojevic, his soulful, competitive Manly teammate and great friend, has become NSW skipper instead. Cherry-Evans, 35, and 30-year-old Trbojevic will go head-to-head in an old-fashioned 'mate v mate' State of Origin confrontation in Sydney on June 5 in the State of Origin series opener. \"That theme hasn't necessarily disappeared but it has been a bit hard to lean into a bit lately, without those sort of rivalries,\" Maroons half Cherry-Evans said. \"But two (Origin) captains each coming from the same club is as good as it gets,\" The pair mark the first club teammates to captain opposing states since 2000, when Sydney Roosters duo Brad Fittler and Adrian Lam led NSW and Queensland. Cherry-Evans is also a good friend of Tedesco, shares the same management company, and has represented Australia alongside him. The 2011 premiership winner was dropped in 2015 from the Maroons and spent three years in the Origin wilderness. So news of 31-year-old fullback Tedesco's axing in favour of Penrith's Dylan Edwards - after Tedesco and Cherry-Evans had contested four consecutive Origin series against each other as opposition captains - hit home. \"That's hard because I have been there before. I have been dropped from Queensland and it sucks,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"There are really no words to explain it because we as footy players want to keep doing it forever and ever. \"I'm not here to say the door is shut on Teddy to play for the Blues ever again but obviously it hurts initially. \"They have ... gone with Dylan. Madge (NSW coach Michael Maguire) is obviously not afraid to make the moves that he thinks will put them in the best position. \"As a friend of Teddy's, it was definitely disappointing.\" Cherry-Evans explained his mixed emotions in a nutshell. \"Teddy gets dropped and my current teammate becomes captain. It is hard not to be really happy and proud for Jake for how hard he has worked and his perseverance as a footy player,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"He continually rocks up and plays good footy each week and it is amazing to see where he is now. He is NSW captain.\" It is why Cherry-Evans expects to face a NSW side, led by middle forward Trbojevic, that will give no quarter. \"He is a win-at-all-costs player. Jake doesn't have a good poker face,\" Cherry-Evans grinned. \"That is the best way to explain it. If (Manly) have lost, he is not happy. With the wins, he rides them just as hard as anyone else. I am really proud of Jake. He has worked so hard and been super-competitive for a long time.\" Cherry-Evans said he had texted Trbojevic \"to say congrats\" but that they wouldn't speak again before the series opener.

        "content": "A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travellers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travellers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travellers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travellers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travellers will fly between June 1 and Aug. 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday – 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honour America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honours the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

She was supposed to take the 9.11 am train from Grant Road to Andheri in the western suburbs. That was the last day Kirti’s family members saw her. Six years after she went missing, two of Kirti’s colleagues were convicted Monday for murdering her . On March 16, 2018, around 11.30 am, Kirti’s mother attempted to contact her to know the WiFi password of their home Internet connection, to share it with a relative. However, Kirti’s phone was switched off. Advertisement Assuming she was busy at work, Kirti’s mother did not call her again. Read | How a bloodstain in a car led Mumbai police to solve a murder However, when Kirti did not return home by the usual time, her family attempted to reach her, but both her phone numbers remained unreachable. They contacted her HR Manager at B-Blunt, who confirmed that Kirti had not reported to work that day. In a bid to aid the family, Kirti’s manager enlisted the help of two colleagues, one of whom was Siddhesh Tamhankar, Kirti’s junior at B-Blunt. Advertisement The following day, the two colleagues visited Grant Road railway station to inquire if any regular commuters had seen Kirti. Simultaneously, the police began reviewing CCTV footage for clues. However, Kirti was not spotted at Grant Road or Andheri railway stations, and the building’s CCTV indicated she had left around 8:55 a.m. Kirti, a qualified chartered accountant and law graduate, had joined B-Blunt’s accounts department in 2012. B-Blunt, co-founded by Adhuna Bhabani, a celebrity hair stylist and former wife of actor-producer-director Farhan Akhtar, requested Akhtar and other celebrities to utilise social media in the quest for information on Kirti. Advertisement Later, Tamhankar disclosed a crucial detail to his colleagues and to the police about the day Kirti went missing. He claimed that he and another female colleague were en route to South Mumbai that day and offered Kirti a lift to work, which she initially accepted but later declined, expressing concern about traffic delays. When questioned by police about the delay in revealing this information, Tamhankar cited his relationship with the colleague, who was married, as the reason for his silence. The police alleged that Kirti had reprimanded Tamhankar at work for accounting errors and issued a warning, sparking suspicion. However, lacking concrete evidence against Tamhankar, the police continued their investigation for 50 days. Advertisement On May 6, 2018, the police claimed a breakthrough when a blood stain discovered in the car driven by the female accused matched Kirti’s parents’ DNA. Subsequently, Tamhankar and the female colleague were arrested. The police asserted that the pair engaged in a confrontation with Kirti after picking her up near her residence on March 16, 2018, resulting in her strangulation and subsequent disposal of her body in a creek in Wadala. Despite extensive search efforts using drones, local fishermen, and other means, no trace of Kirti was found. The police alleged that the accused were aware of tidal movements, preventing the body from resurfacing.",

No more global treaties, no more global organizations, no more entangling alliances, no more eroding of national sovereignty. The UN, WHO, and all of the NGOs who meddle in the internal affairs of nations for left wing ends need to be abolished https://t.co/CYD6M8eLXh We completely agree. The Left loves to scream about colonialism and invasions but welcomes this nonsense. No, thank you. This is huge. This treaty would have taken away all of our Sovereignty to make our own medical decisions. https://t.co/IuaZV6KFVS And we cannot allow that. Ever. What our own government did during COVID was bad enough. After four years of fighting the WHO agenda, our effort to thwart this #WHOPowerGrab has succeeded. https://t.co/qgZa1YsKb5 They'll revisit this again and again until they win. So stay vigilant. Fantastic news. The pending Community Note says they will keep pushing for a new agreement. Perhaps, but the longer the process takes, the more will be revealed about their failings. https://t.co/7bJ3S6eAH0 As we said -- this doesn't end here. It's a victory in this battle, not in the war.

        "content": "As the dust begins to settle on the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix, it is time to bring you up to speed with the major talking points. Red Bull has revealed just how badly their pockets have been hit after Sergio Perez crashed out in dramatic fashion alongside the Haas cars in Monaco, while photographers narrowly escaped getting caught up in the chaos, thankfully. Here is your post-Monaco Monday F1 news round-up... After being tagged by the Haas of Kevin Magnussen on the run up the hill out of Sainte Devote, Perez found himself pinballing between the barriers with only the survival cell of his Red Bull RB20 left intact. It was a huge relief to see Perez walk away unscathed. His Red Bull of course was far from unscathed, with senior advisor Helmut Marko claiming the cost of that shunt for the team is “two to three million”, which is far from ideal for Red Bull in the cost cap era. Read more – Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash Photographers were gathered at the point of impact as Perez hit the barriers and they ended up far closer to the action than they would have anticipated, footage showing the force of the impact as debris flew and photographers fled.

Team boss Bruno Famin was fuming with Ocon, with Famin reportedly giving “serious” thought to benching Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix as a result. Read more – Esteban Ocon benching ‘under serious consideration’ by Alpine after Monaco crash – report With the race red flagged after those opening lap shenanigans, Hamilton gave an “I told you guys” message over Mercedes team radio as he headed for the pit lane, causing plenty of discussion over what he meant by that. Hamilton quashed talk that this was in reference to him not being happy about starting on the hard tyre. Instead, he was referencing his prediction of an incident.

Hamilton was among the drivers to offer his advice on how to change that, suggesting “three mandatory stops”, while Damon Hill threw the idea of lighter and shorter cars into the mix.

        "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo may not have won the title in his first full Saudi Pro League season but has set a new scoring record.",
        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has added yet another record to his collection as he set a new high for goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season. The 39-year-old struck twice in Al-Nassr's 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park to take his total to 35, eclipsing Abderrazak Hamdallah's 34 from 2018-19. Hamdallah, who was also playing for Al-Nassr at the time, but is now with Al-Ittihad, could at least take some comfort from the fact that his haul came in just 27 league games, four fewer than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star's. Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil's long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club's final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb's penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer's strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho for the visitors ultimately saw Al-Nassr prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

        "description": "About 62% of all Chinese migrants arriving at America's borders are entering the country through San Diego, DailyMail.com can reveal.",
        "content": "Shocking new border statistics reveal the surprising countries migrants are flocking to the US from San Diego border sees migrants from over 170 countries High number of Chinese migrants arriving in Southern California By Maryann Martinez, Texas Bureau Chief For Dailymail.Com Published: 22:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Shocking new border statistics have revealed the surprising countries spawning an influx of migrants to the US. While Chinese migrants continue to dominate the list, thousands are also pouring in from India, Vietnam, Turkey, Uzebakistan and the West African nation of Mauritania. About 62% of all Chinese migrants arriving at America's borders are entering the country through San Diego, according to US Border Patrol statistics. At least 48,501 Chinese migrants have crossed into the US illegally- mostly surrendering to Border Patrol with the hopes of seeking asylum- from Oct. 1 through April. Chinese migrants wait to be processed after crossing the border with Mexico Wednesday, May 8, 2024, near Jacumba Hot Springs, Calif. San Diego became the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in April, according to U.S. government data 'It’s an 8,600% increase over all of fiscal year 2021, when just 342 Chinese nationals crossed illegally - across the entire southern border,' Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin tweeted . NEW BORDER NUMBERS 48,501 - China 8,900 - India 7,800 - Turkey 2,900 - Uzbekistan 4,400 - Mauritania 3,000 - Vietnam 5,600 - Guinea Advertisement Of those, 27,135 entered the country either in San Diego or in the area east of the city, which is all considered the San Diego sector by the Border Patrol. On Saturday alone, at least 118 Chinese citizens illegally cross into the region, Fox News reported. While most of the border sees most of its migrants from countries like Mexico and Venezuela, the area near San Diego attracts migrants from around the world. Since the start of the fiscal year, more than 8,900 migrants from India have arrived there. Another 7,800 from Turkey, 5,600 from 5,600+ Guinea and 4,400 from Mauritania have also entered the country there. 'There is now an orchestrated, well organized cartel smuggling operation of Chinese into Southern California,' Melugin stated. As DailyMail.com was first to report, Chinese migrants are being smuggled into the US with the help of Chinese gangs known as 'snakeheads' who are operating in synchrony with Mexican cartels. Asian criminal organizations have been working in Mexico for many year in drug trade and money laundering, but have recently moved into human trafficking business as Chinese migrants have started showing up at the border, cartel expert Robert Almonte told DailyMail.com. 'The Chinese (smugglers) just can't go over there and cut the Mexican cartels out - that just doesn't happen. They've got to be paying the Mexican cartel some kind of a percentage, quota or tax,' he said. The global arrivals in Southern California helped to propel the San Diego sector as the busiest in the nation. At least 37,370 migrants entered the US through the San Diego sector, which includes all of Southern California except for El Centro on the Arizona state line, according to the US Border Patrol. A Chinese migrant camp near Jacumba, California has signs showing Chinese asylum seekers where to turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents In April, the San Diego region surpassed Tucson, which had been the nation's busiest, and fell to second with 31,219 border encounters. El Paso sector, which includes the West Texas city and all of New Mexico , rose to third with 30,393. San Diego's rise as the number one border hot spot had been expected, as the area had been getting bombarded with as many as 6,000-8,000 border crossers a week in the last few months. 'Unfortunately, I'm not surprised,' San Diego County Commissioner Jim Desmond told DailyMail.com last month. ' Texas is clamping down and other areas are clamping down. Here in California, they're allowed to walk in unimpeded. They're going to follow the path of least resistance, and the least resistance is in California.' A $13 billion business of trafficking humans from Mexico into the US has been described as whac-a-mole by border experts- where one area flares up as others quiet down. Migrants who are arrested in San Diego sector are vetted by US Border Patrol are being released onto the streets. The county migrant shelter closed a few months back, after local leaders decided they did not want to the $18 million dollars a year to keep running it. However, the county has been promised $20 million by the Biden to open up a shelter in the coming weeks. 'It was costing us, at that point in time, about $1.5 million a month to basically be their travel agent. Border Patrol was their Uber, bringing them to those drop off areas, and then we were their travel agent,' Desmond quipped. Without the local shelter, migrants are either being let loose at a transit station or at the airport by the feds. Migrants have been known to spend as many as five days crashing at the airport while they wait for a flight out of town, Desmond added. Like other border communities across the country, San Diego's airport does not add extra flights simply because there's a spike in migrant crossings. Often times, there aren't available seat to fly out or migrants, with limited means, wait a day or two until ticket prices drop and they can afford to travel to their final destination.

        "content": "Most cameras have at least one exclusive attribute, and the OM System Cameras have more than most. Its ever-expanding “Live” collection contains some of its unique computational photography features. Let’s dive into five of its tools to find out what they do and how you can use them. Some new OM System users are at first daunted by the enormous range of features on the and their predecessors. Going back three generations to the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, the flagship camera was marketed as overengineered because of its enormous range of functions and customization. The current has come much further. The Live features in the camera open up a world of creative possibilities. This was shot using LiveND. I'm a fan of technology and what it can do; I come from the generation that could program the VCR and saw the first digital watches and smartphones appear. Historically, I worked in a highly technical engineering environment, so using advanced features comes relatively easily to me. Nevertheless, I also understand that a camera's functions can be intimidating for many. Cameras are easy to use once you understand how their different functions work. So, this article explains how to use some of the OM System's most useful tools. Although primarily aimed at OM System users, this may also be interesting for those who use other camera systems and are curious about these computational photography functions. Computational photography uses the camera's processor to enhance the captured images. It improves the camera's capabilities by using features unique to digital photography. Examples of computational photography include in-camera focus stacking, HDR compilations, and creating high-resolution shots using sensor shift technology. The OM System has a raft of these features. However, the \"Live\" family is most useful for me. Live Time and Live Bulb allow you to watch a long exposure gradually develop on the live view screen or viewfinder. You can also see the histogram move to the right during the shot, enabling you to judge accurately the correct exposure. This takes the guesswork out of the timing of very long exposures and makes bulb mode more accessible to photographers. Images can be saved as raw files or JPEGs. Live Time is found in bulb mode with the newest and the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III. Select B on the mode dial and rotate the rear thumb dial one click clockwise, and you will switch from Live Bulb to Live Time. On older Olympus models, Live Time was hidden away in Manual Mode beyond the 60-second shutter speed. (Unlike most cameras that are limited to 30 seconds in manual mode, you can do 60-second exposures with OM System cameras.) Once you have selected Live Time or Live Bulb, as shown above, you can choose how often you want the Live View screen to refresh. The number of times the camera will refresh the view depends on the ISO; the higher the ISO, the fewer times it will refresh. Press the Menu button, and you will see at ISO 80, it will refresh 24 times, and you can select refresh intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. So, for long exposure star trails, you would choose 60 seconds. Meanwhile, for aurora shots where you may only want an 8-second exposure, you would refresh every half a second. With Live Time, you begin the exposure by briefly pressing the shutter release button and stop it by pressing it again. Meanwhile, for Live Bulb, you hold down the shutter button for the entire duration of the exposure; I generally use Live Time. You can operate the camera using a remote wired or wireless trigger. You can also use a smartphone or tablet and the OM Image Share app. Then you can watch the exposure developing on that device instead. The maximum duration for Live Time and Live Bulb is 30 minutes. When shooting very long exposures, you need your camera on a stable platform, and a good-quality tripod is ideal. The general advice is to switch the In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) off when using a tripod. However, I leave mine on auto as it switches off when the camera is still but also counteracts any slight movement caused by the wind or vibrations underfoot. Silent mode using the electronic shutter prevents in-camera vibrations, and if you don’t have the facility to trigger the camera remotely, the self-timer works well. Even if you misjudge the exposure time and run out of screen refreshes, you can generally estimate the correct exposure time by seeing how far along to the right the histogram has moved so far. For example, if it only moved a quarter of the way from the left in eight minutes, you know it will need another eight minutes for the histogram to move halfway. Long exposures can cause noise artifacts on your image, so switching your Noise Reduction on is preferable. On the OM-1, this is in Camera Menu 1.3 ISO/Noise Reduction. I have this set to Auto. Live Comp (Live Composite) Mode continuously takes a series of images, usually of the same scene. It only adds new, brighter light appearing in subsequent frames to the first image. The huge advantage is that you can effectively shoot a scene over an enormously long period—up to six hours—and never over-expose the original frame. Thus, Live Comp can be used for light painting, star and car headlight trails, capturing images of lightning, and so on. The final image can be saved as a raw or JPEG. Live Comp is adjacent to the Live Time settings, so at the bottom of the M mode on older cameras, or two clicks clockwise of the thumb wheel in Bulb Mode with the newer models. After selecting Live Comp, press the Menu button, which takes you to the Composite Settings. You can set the exposure's shutter speed between 0.5 to 60 seconds. You then can adjust the lens aperture and ISO and, if necessary, fit an ND filter for the correct exposure. Place the camera on a tripod, and press the shutter once to prepare for composite shooting. The second press of the shutter will start the composite. Again, you can see the image form on the back screen with brighter light being added to the original scene. Like Live Time, it’s best shot using a tripod. Again, the final image can be saved as a raw or JPEG. Because the shortest shutter speed available is 0.5 seconds, in broad daylight that would lead to over-exposure, even at ISO 80 and f/22. Consequently, using this feature to photograph lightning during the day, I fit an ND1000 filter to the lens to reduce the shutter speed. The Live ND filter partially does away with the need to carry physical ND filters by providing them electronically. On the original OM-1, the ND filter goes from ND2 (one stop) and up to ND64 (six stops), and up to ND128 is available on the OM-1 Mark II. The latter model also provides a graduated neutral density filter up to ND8 (three stops). Live ND darkens down the image, thus enabling longer exposures. Live GND works similarly but affects the part of the image to which it is applied. It allows shooting a scene with a greater dynamic range because it darkens the highlighted area, usually the sky at the top of the picture. Images can be saved as raw files or JPEGs. Live ND is available on the OM-1 Mark II, the OM-1, OM-5, and some earlier OM-D cameras. Live GND is currently only available on the OM-1 Mark II. In older models with the older menu system, Live ND is in Shooting Menu 2. With the newest models, Live ND and GND are found in the Shooting Menu (camera icon) 2.1 Computational Modes. Live ND is only accessible in manual mode (M on the mode dial) or shutter priority (S on the mode dial). Meanwhile, Live GND is also available in aperture priority (A) and program (P) modes. The filters are both activated within the menu, as shown above. Live ND will allow longer shutter times. Meanwhile, the Live GND can be moved up and down using the arrow button above and below the OK button. It can also be rotated using the front and rear dials, and the axis around which can be moved with the left and right arrow buttons. Within the menu, you can also choose a soft, medium, or hard boundary between the filtered and unfiltered areas. Because the offer up to 8.5 stops of image stabilization, it’s possible to use these features without a tripod. I've handheld 5-second exposures. During bright sunlight, my screw-on ND1000 filter will only allow, at the longest, something like a one-second exposure. However, combining it with Live ND gives scope to take up to one-minute exposures even at midday.

Because you care about their safety, brushing up on the current road rules is in their best interest – and yours. In NSW, it is not illegal to travel with your pet in the front seat provided it doesn't impede your ability to maintain control of the vehicle. Drivers travelling on a public street must not carry a dog on the open back of a moving vehicle, like a ute, unless the dog is restrained or enclosed in some kind of way. In Victoria, it is not illegal for your dog to sit in the passenger seat. There are no rules mandating you restrain your dog in a moving vehicle, You will also face a fine of $277 if you drive with your dog on your lap in Victoria. Additionally, for more than 10 minutes when outside temperatures are at or over 28 degrees Celsius. In Queensland your dog can travel in the front passenger seat, but never on a driver's lap. Under the Animal Car and Protection Act 2001, drivers have a duty to ensure the safety of their pet when travelling inside a vehicle, or on a vehicle tray or trailer. Therefore, it's your dog safely travels in an enclosed cage in the back of an open vehicle. The Queensland Government's website states pet owners must ensure no part of the dog's body besides their head can protrude from the vehicle, as apply. However, there are no specific that state your dog must be restrained inside your vehicle. In the ACT it is not illegal to travel with your dog in the front passenger seat, but is an offence for your pet to travel on the your lap while you drive. Under the Animal Welfare Act of 1992, your dog must be restrained to back of a ute – or properly restrained inside the a vehicle. If your dog won't distract you from driving or impede your control, they can sit in the front passenger seat. Yes, in Western Australia dogs can travel in the front passenger seat of your car, as long as they're restrained. However in Western Australia, it is illegal to travel with a dog on the driver's lap. Additionally, placing your unrestrained dog in the passenger seat where they can move around freely can lead to a fine if a police officer considers it careless driving. In South Australia, it is illegal to have a pet sitting on your lap (as a driver), but is not illegal for your dog to travel in your front seat. Similarly, the declares it illegal to transport an unrestrained dog in the open tray of a utility, truck or similar vehicle, as it puts their safety at risk. The maximum fine for disobeying this law is $750. It is not illegal to travel with your dog in the front passenger seat in the Northern Territory. Under the Animal Welfare Act 1999, drivers must transport an animal in a reasonable and appropriate manner that does not inflict any harm or pain. Breaching this law results in a $100 fine. Pet owners cannot transport a dog unless it is in or on the vehicle.

        "content": "A global race to dominate the global artificial intelligence (AI) space is on, and countries are battling to outrun one another. Canada is one of the first movers in AI research, but several other countries have surpassed it lately. Sensing its declining rankings, Canada recently a $2.4 billion AI spending package to secure the country’s homegrown AI industry. Two , including ( ), or IBM, and ( ) stock, could be the early beneficiaries. To understand how each identified AI stock may benefit, its important to take a look at how Canada is channeling its sovereign AI spending budget. How will Canada spend its $2.4 billion AI investment budget? The government of Canada may disburse its $2.4 billion AI budget as follows: Most of the direct beneficiaries from the budget may be small and medium enterprises, research centres, and startups. These beneficiaries are mostly available to early-stage venture capital and private equity investors, and many may be inaccessible to public stock market investors. That said, a few publicly traded AI stocks could benefit, and Nvidia stock is one of them. Nvidia stock: Getting more business from Canada The Government of Canada and Nvidia a strategic deal in February 2024 — weeks before the country’s AI budget announcement. The deal, which is aimed at boosting computing power, came as Nvidia’s chief executive joined Canada’s AI luminaries to explore their breakthroughs in healthcare, transportation, and other AI advances. Nvidia, a leading AI stock, acknowledges Canada as an early partner (customer) since the early days of artificial intelligence, and the latest deal, whose numbers remain private, may include a guaranteed supply of AI accelerators to the country. Canada’s $2 billion investment in AI computing capabilities and technology infrastructure will most likely involve acquiring new data centre equipment, including the latest AI computing chips, and Nvidia is the leading vendor of AI computing hardware today. To be fair, Canada’s purchases of AI equipment under the $2 billion budget may not single-handedly move the needle on Nvidia’s stock price. The wildly successful recently reported a record US$26 billion in quarterly sales. IBM stock: Picking up strategic investments One of the key pillars of Canada’s AI growth strategy is strengthening its local semiconductor supply chain. On April 26, 2024, the prime minister’s office a $59.9 million investment to support IBM Canada and the MiQro Innovation Collaborative Center (C2MI), one of the country’s microelectronics research and innovation leaders, to create more semiconductors. IBM expects up to $187 million in total investment in advancing its Canadian subsidiary’s plant’s assembly, testing, and packaging capabilities, and the Government of Canada’s investment helps create a strong domestic production of semiconductors, furthering quantum research within Canadian borders. Semiconductors remain critical in the global race to scale up and adopt artificial intelligence and quantum computing. It’s unclear whether the IBM investment is directly related to the $2 billion AI budget. However, the deal could help Canada create a more vibrant semiconductor research and development ecosystem and help retain AI talent within the country. IBM is a significant AI stock to watch as its Watson AI platform gains traction. Its new AI processors in 2022 may eventually creep into an undersupplied market dominated by Nvidia’s hot-selling AI accelerators.",

        "content": "Murder and a murder conspiracy cases were delayed in B.C. Supreme Court May 27 due to a shortage of sheriffs that continues in B.C. despite the attorney general’s assurances it is being dealt with. Justice Kathleen Ker came into court to hear the two cases but had to leave as there was no sheriff. Sheriffs are required in courtrooms to provide security for proceedings. They also move prisoners around courthouses and transport them to court. About a dozen lawyers, including four publicly paid Crown prosecutors, were left milling around outside the courtroom at the Vancouver Law Courts on Monday. One case involved an appearance by Pascal Jean Claude Bouthillete. He and Sandy Jack Parisian were accused in the death of 78-year-old Usha Singh. Singh, who lived alone, was found badly beaten in her house on Jan. 31, 2021. Vancouver police said two men gained entry to Singh’s Little Mountain home around 6 a.m. by posing as police officers. Singh succumbed to her injuries in hospital two days later. Parisian and Bouthillete were arrested on Feb. 3, 2021. The conspiracy to commit murder case involves multiple accused. Two men are facing the court together while a third is facing the charges separately. Due to a series of publication bans in the case and the separate trials, Glacier Media has chosen not to publish details at this time. Court delays in B.C.’s justice system due to sheriff shortages have become more common in recent years. Thirty-one courtrooms were closed in Abbotsford, North Vancouver, Port Coquitlam and Surrey between Aug. 14 and Sept. 13, 2023. Earlier in 2023, sources told Glacier Media courtroom closures included those in Vancouver, Abbotsford, Port Coquitlam, Surrey, Victoria, Chilliwack and Kamloops. Concerns have already been expressed before judges and by judges that delays could begin to hamper people's right to a trial within a reasonable time period. This comes before the courts as lawyers begin mentioning the application of the so-called Jordan principles whereby that right is upheld. The Jordan principles stem from a case that wound up in the Supreme Court of Canada. Stays of proceedings are possible if a case hits a ceiling of 18 months for those tried in the provincial court and 30 months for cases in superior courts. On the May 27 Vancouver Provincial Court list alone, there were 32 cases listed in excess of 300 days (or nearly 10 months). “Delay attributable to or waived by the defence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling,” the high court said. Attorney General Nikki Sharma has acknowledged the problems created by the shortage and stressed the provincial government is working on recruiting new sheriffs. In February, Sharma announced the addition of 13 new deputies . \"Everyone who uses the court system expects it to run safely and smoothly,\" Sharma said in a statement at the time. \"Sheriffs provide critical protective and enforcement services for the judiciary, Crown, defence, court staff and the public. That's why it's so encouraging that more people than ever are applying to join the BC Sheriff Service.\" The new deputies will fill positions in Oliver, Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria and the Lower Mainland, Sharma said. Getting those recruits to courtrooms, however, does take time as they need to undergo training at the Justice Institute of BC. Glacier Media has reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on the May 27 proceedings.",

        "content": "Hit Man Review: An Outrageously Awesome Rom-Com of Sorts By Richard Linklater is back with what may be his most entertaining movie. He’s consistently produced fantastic works in many different genres for decades. He co-writes and directs , a romantic crime comedy of sorts. Glen Powell co-writes and stars in the film as Gary Johnson, a college professor who works part time with the New Orleans Police Department. He works undercover posing as a hitman so that his “clients” who try to hire him end up getting arrested. But when a woman named Maddy Masters (Adria Arjona) hires him to kill her husband, things become quite interesting. Hit Man works so well on every level. It’s genuinely a riot from start to finish. There isn’t a dull moment in this film. It’s exceedingly rewatchable, especially with large groups of people. Although this movie will land on Netflix’s streaming platform soon, it is playing in a few theaters and I’d recommend seeing it in one. This movie is an absolute blast and there are so many things the film has going for it. For one, the premise feels very fresh. Although the movie hits many familiar beats surrounding love stories harmed by a fake identity, the particular approach and style this movie has makes it feel unique. The reason to see this movie is Glen Powell. He has been working his way to stardom for many years, having had small roles in Spy Kids 3D and The Dark Knight Rises. And ever since I (and others) saw him on the big screen in Top Gun: Maverick, we knew that was a movie star in the making. He followed that up in 2023 with the theatrical box office hit Anyone But You. Although that movie was very successful and is a shining example of a rare theatrical rom-com, Hit Man is everything that I wanted that movie to be in terms of quality. This film takes the conventions of a romantic comedy and puts such a fun spin on it, while Anyone But You stuck to the formula too much. When Gary meets Maddy, he’s undercover, playing a hitman. There’s a wonderful idea here because in real life, Gary is a bit of a boring nerd. But when he’s playing this hitman persona for Maddy, he’s attractive, confident, and many things that he usually isn’t. That puts an interesting spin on their romance because she has no idea who he really is. As they spend more time together, we get a sense of their chemistry. And while Powell was leaning into the affair rumors with Sydney Sweeney to help promote his previous rom-com, the chemistry is even better in this movie. It’s funny, lovely, and very sexy. Arjona enchants the screen unlike any other as Maddy, and although she’s had roles in films like Triple Frontier and Morbius, this was my first time taking full note of her ability. It’s safe to say that with the upcoming Twisters, Monsanto, Edgar Wright’s Running Man reboot, and JJ Abrams’s next movie, Powell has become Hollywood’s new hot ticket. He’s booked and busy as ever, and it’s wonderful to see him reteam with Linklater. The actor/director duo had previously worked together on Everybody Wants Some!! and Apollo 101⁄2: A Space Age Childhood. They’ve collaborated on a screenplay built for Powell’s talents. The fun thing about Gary is the fact that he plays various hitmen and he plays them all as very different characters. He has to play a redheaded sociopath, he needs to do a Russian accent, and for one of them, he does a spot-on impression of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Not only are all these hitmen characters hilarious, but they quickly show you Powell’s range and comic ability. But above all else, Hit Man is a rom-com. This movie is quite funny, even if it can feel at one point like the hitman story comes to a halt. It spends a sizable amount of time with Gary and Maddy. Linklater is no stranger to romance with his pitch-perfect Before trilogy, but there are times in Hit Man where it feels like the relationship’s focus is more sexual than a deeper connection. It may anger the prudish “unnecessary sex scene” Twitter users but this is a sexy film all while giving you a strong hook. Halfway through the film, the storyline surrounding the romance becomes tied to a storyline surrounding real killing. That’s where the movie becomes both gripping and outrageously humorous. The story gets very investing once this shift happens, and there are many scenes in Hit Man that put the biggest smile on your face as a result. It knows how to put the audience a step ahead of some supporting characters while making us suspicious of other characters. Seeing Gary find himself in over his head as he needs to maintain the illusion of who he is despite never killing anyone is quite amusing. That’s what makes Hit Man such a special movie; it’s darkly funny, it has a killer ending, and it’s a well-paced movie with a strong flair from Linklater. Don’t miss it. As ComingSoon’s explains, a score of 8 equates to “Great.” While there are a few minor issues, this score means that the art succeeds at its goal and leaves a memorable impact. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films. Share article Related",

        "content": "Langley RCMP officers would have acted illegally if they took a man into custody for threatening suicide because he convincingly claimed otherwise, B.C.’s Independent Investigations Office (IIO) has ruled. The man, identified only as AP, killed himself a few days after police visited in January. A Monday, May 27 decision released by the police watchdog shows officers visited AP twice after he texted his mother to say “I am done and I can’t do this anymore” and she contacted RCMP to advise her son had attempted suicide in the past. During the first visit by an RCMP officer on Jan. 10, AP insisted he was “merely expressing frustration at academic studies in which he was engaged, as well as other difficulties in his life,” the IIO review summarized. A previous IIO statement said AP was living in the 20200 block of 66th Ave. at the time. AP said he was taking his medications properly, showed the officer the meds “laid out in an orderly manner” and agreed to call for help if he required it. Less than an hour later, a social worker reported receiving emails from the man threatening suicide. When two Langley officers returned to his home later that day, AP insisted the email was referring to actions to be taken in the future, in the event of his death, “not a plan to die shortly.” He had been drinking, and one of the officers convinced him to pour out the remaining alcohol to avoid further escalation, the report said. According to the RCMP members, AP was “evidently intelligent and insightful, was able to respond to all their concerns, and all their questions in a plausible and reassuring manner.” On Jan. 11, an officer spoke with the AP’s mother, who later told the IIO she did not have any concern that he was in immediate danger of self-harm at that time. Another family member, who spoke with AP that same day, said there was “no suggestion that he was in imminent danger.” But when the mother was unable to contact her son, police returned to the home on Jan., 14 and found AP dead from apparent suicide. IIO Interim Chief Civilian Director Sandra J. Hentzen ruled the officers “did everything they reasonably could to test him for present suicidal intention and he passed the tests. It appears that not only was [he] able to conceal his true intent from the police, but he was also able to deceive close family members in the time between the officers’ visits and his eventual death.” Officers did not have sufficient grounds to apprehend AP under the Mental Health Act based on their personal observations,” Hentzen said. “It would in fact have been unlawful for them to proceed with an apprehension and it was appropriate for them not to do so.” Accordingly “the matter will not be referred to Crown counsel for consideration of charges,” Hentzen ruled.",

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are — including , , and — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a in the state.",

        "content": "AMITE, La. (AP) — Authorities in south Louisiana searched Monday for two of four men who escaped a parish jail through a perimeter fence. Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards said the four inmates fled the facility through a section of the fence that “was found to be vulnerable and easily maneuvered in such a way that a small statured body could slide through.” Earlier Monday, authorities found two of the escaped men — Avery Guidry, 19, and Travon Johnson, 21, both of Natalbany — hiding in a trash bin behind a store in Amite, Edwards said. The other two — Omarion Hookfin, 19, of Hammond, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20, of Amite — remained on the run, he said. The sheriff’s office said Johnson, Hookfin and Guidry were in jail following their arrest for a 2022 homicide in Hammond, while Cyprian was serving time for armed robbery and weapon charges. Hookfin also acquired additional charges of aggravated battery while jailed in a separate case in Catahoula Parish, authorities said. Edwards urged anyone with information on the whereabouts of the remaining escaped inmates to contact emergency authorities or call CrimeStoppers of Tangipahoa’s anonymous tip line at 800-554-5245.",

        "description": "After being eliminated from the Big East tournament in excruciating fashion, the UConn baseball team chose to take the bus home from Ohio, and the healing began. Now the Huskies have a fresh start in the NCAA Tournament, the sixth bid in a row for the program.",
        "content": "STORRS — There wasn’t a whole lot to say, but a whole lot to think about. The UConn baseball team , after dominating the Big East all season , took an early, rather unceremonious exit from the conference tournament. After failing to get the winning run in from third with no outs in the ninth, they lost to Xavier in 11 innings , the completion of a suspended game. Then after leading four different times, they lost to Georgetown in 10 innings . It was double-elimination, two-and-out in a matter of hours last Thursday. They tried to get an earlier flight home, but couldn’t and Coach Jim Penders decided the Huskies, who’d been away from home a week and a half, had enough of hotels. So the players and coaches were going to board the bus in Mason, Ohio, on Friday morning and ride home, a good 14 hours with a couple of stops. “The first couple of hours were a little bad,” senior pitcher Garret Coe said , “it was still stinging a little, but being around each other for that long was probably good for us.” On everyone’s mind: Was the season over? Were the seniors’ careers over? Had this one terrible day wiped out months of accomplishment? Or would the Huskies gather on Monday get a reprieve from the NCAA and a ticket to the Field of 64 ? “Personally, I was very confident, I think the coaches were pretty confident, I’m pretty sure everyone was pretty confident we would get a bid,” said catcher Matt Garbowski , a junior. “Because we deserved it.” Penders, his son, Charlie, and the assistant coaches had to sweat out the weekend, wondering if upsets in the other conference tournament’s would kill UConn’s chances for an at-large bid. “I was rooting for Duke (to win the ACC Tournament) for the first time in my life,” Penders said, not to mention Arizona, Louisiana Tech and a few others.. By Monday morning, things looked good. And when the team gathered in the lounge at the Toscano Family Ice Forum, the Huskies learned a few minutes into the selection show that they will be heading to Norman, Okla. — by plane — to face Duke, oddly enough, in the first round of the Oklahoma Regional on Friday. The host Sooners will play Oral Roberts. “They’ve survived,” Penders said. “They’ve been resilient, they found a way to fight, they won every Big East weekend.” UConn (32-23) started out the season 9-15, taking its lumps against top-level competition in the Southeast and on the West Coast. After a particularly tough loss at Cal-Santa Barbara, pitching coach Josh MacDonald admonished the players, “We’re not going to quit on you, don’t quit on us.” The Huskies hit their stride in Big East play, going 17-4 to win the regular-season title by three games over St. John’s, which won the automatic bid. They were No. 41 in RPI, right on the borderline in the selection committee’s key metric, but two things were in their favor: Conference series, which weigh more heavily than midweek games, and reputation. In the past, particularly 2017, reputation worked against UConn, as it often does for teams in this part of the country. Northeastern, despite a mid-30s RPI and two midweek wins over UConn, was snubbed Monday. But UConn, with 10 tournament appearances since 2010, became the first team from New England to go to the NCAA six years in a row. The program won a regional at Maryland two years ago, and has proven itself as a national player. “Coach Penders said it best,” Coe said, “a lot of times in selection shows in the past, when we didn’t have the automatic bid, it didn’t fall in our favor, it wasn’t necessarily about us getting in. It was about those other guys who were passed over, not given another chance. Finally, UConn’s got the respect to go show it.” During the Big East tournament, freshman pitcher Tommy Turner, who tells teammates he watches the runner on every home run, shouted into the dugout that a runner missed second. With nothing to lose, Penders asked for a review, which showed the runner had hit the center of the base hard enough to raise dust. “They were saying, ‘Has Penders lost his mind?'” Penders said. “So on the bus, I got up, and said, ‘Tommy, what did you see? The guy not only touched the bag, he came down right in the middle of it?’ And everybody laughed.” The gloom began to lift. From there, the long ride through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut felt normal, guys playing their video games, reading, bonding again, healing. “And when we got home, we showered and washed it all off,” Coe said. Along the way, Penders glanced down at his phone and read an email from a fan on the Connecticut shoreline who described himself as an “old timer,” who listened to every pitch of every UConn game. It was a long message of encouragement, not the kind of anonymous, what-were-you-thinking stuff a coach might see at such moments. Penders responded with a long message of thanks, promising the fan that his team would stay “in the arena” and fight, and he would be right there with the Huskies. Then as the bus was arriving in Storrs, Penders read the emails to his team. “It was pretty impactful,” Garbowski said. “Coach was saying he usually gets a bunch of emails from no-names saying, ‘You guys stink, you guys stink,’ and he just deletes them right away. This one stuck with us. When he read to us, it made me feel good about myself and I’m sure a lot of other guys, to know there are people out there who have your back and support you no matter what the guys are going through.” The challenges ahead next week, Duke, Oklahoma, are massive. The “Road to Omaha” is long and filled with them. Any and all positive re-enforcement will come in handy.",

        "content": "The latest season of AMC's Interview With the Vampire has successfully recreated the iconic Théâtre des Vampires, a key element from Anne Rice's 1976 novel. Production designer Mara LaPere-Schloop, drawn to the artistic promise of creating the Théâtre des Vampires and its coven, found her satisfaction in Season 2. \"More than anything, I really wanted to sink my teeth into this theater and the coven,\" LaPere-Schloop told Variety . Theatre des Vampires debuted in Season 2 The Théâtre des Vampires made its first appearance in the second episode of the new season. The plot follows characters Louis, played by Jacob Anderson, and Claudia, portrayed by Delainey Hayles. They join a coven that lives openly in Paris as a grotesque theater troupe. The series has updated Rice's original setting from the 1800s to the 1940s, featuring the coven putting on blood-splattering performances that captivate a desensitized post-World War II audience. 'Gothic in tone, but not necessarily in a historic way...' To achieve the desired atmosphere, the series required a space that served as an \"unapologetically\" and \"insatiably indulgent oasis for the campy coven.\" LaPere-Schloop and showrunner Rolin Jones aimed for a setting that was gritty yet entrancing. \"Gothic in tone, but not necessarily in a historic way,\" LaPere-Schloop explained, adding, \"More of a turn-of-the-century industrial space with gothic fingerprints on it.\" They discovered the ideal location in an old factory in Prague—one of many European sites scouted for S02. Projection animation used in the coven's performances In the depths of the backstage, LaPere-Schloop's team personalized each vanity for the coven members. The series's most significant mid-century upgrade to Rice's creation is the projection animation used in the coven's performances. This early cinema expressionism style—created in partnership with the London-based theater troupe 1927—charts the passage of time as Louis and Claudia fall deeper under the coven's spell. \"The projections kind of start monochromatic and then, as time passes, we start to see color bleed in,\" LaPere-Schloop explained. Series explores omitted elements from the original novel The series delves into a crucial part of Rice's 1976 novel that was left out from the 1994 film adaptation: Louis and Claudia's quest for other vampires. This journey forms a significant part of the first two seasons' 15 episodes. Jones previously mentioned, \"We always thought this would be a lovely little gift for fans...We focused on the relationship...and how we foreshadow an inevitable ending but do it with a moment of grace.\" It is now streaming on AMC+.",

        "content": "FILE - New York Mets’ Kodai Senga, of Japan, pitches during the first inning in the second baseball game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins, Sept. 27, 2023, in New York. Senga faced hitters Monday, April 29, 2024, for the first time since hurting his shoulder, throwing 21 pitches of live batting practice against minor leaguers at Citi Field. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Injured New York Mets pitcher Kodai Senga is upset he hasn’t been able to help his team this season. “It’s obviously not ideal, a lot of regretful feelings,” he said through a translator on Monday before New York’s series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers was rained out. “I just want to get back out there. I’m here at the stadium. I see all the guys fighting, and it really makes me want to have the urge to go back out there and pitch for the team.” Senga joined the Mets ahead of the 2023 season for a $75 million, five-year contract and became an All-Star in his first season. He went 12-7 with a 2.98 ERA in 29 starts and finished second in NL Rookie of the Year voting. “It’s hard to put a timetable here,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “We got a pretty frustrated player here that he’s not able to contribute to the team.” Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said Feb. 15 that an MRI revealed a capsule strain in the pitching shoulder of the 31-year-old right-hander, a scan performed after Senga twice expressed having shoulder fatigue following throwing sessions. Senga pitched batting practice once in late April and again in early May. He said he needed to work on his mechanics and reported triceps tightness during the road trip that ended last week. Another MRI on Friday showed nerve inflammation in Senga’s right elbow. “When your muscles are not moving the way they’re supposed to, then a lot of different things could get inflamed and it happened to be the nerve this time,” Senga said. He received a cortisone shot on Friday and likely will resume throwing on Wednesday. Senga sounded dispirited over his rehab. “I think that I understand my body well and I think things could have gotten better,” he said. “I’m not overly surprised of where I am. I think I could have fixed some things.” He was concerned about the progression of his return. “In order to get back to 100%, you have to hit each benchmark,” he said. “It’s not one specific thing that caused everything. But just moving forward, I think I have to look forward and bang out each thing that I need to do in order to move on to the next step and ultimately get back to on the mound.” New York waited an extra two weeks before Senga resumed throwing. “We laid out a plan when he first went down in spring training,” the manager said. “Everybody was on board. We listened to some of his suggestions.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "MONTREAL — Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme ForThé in Quebec's Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. \"All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,\" he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they're investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had \"disappeared.\" Ruel didn't say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. \"You can't move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,\" he said in a phone interview. Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. \"There's a lot of emotion, because even if it's a new business, it's still all the work and the life savings,\" he said. \"To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.\" Fortin says it isn't easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it's not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he's heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren't insured against theft. If not, he says he'll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. \"For sure it's very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we're restarting at zero,\" he said.

        "content": "Following the first epic semi-final of the week, we have our first two Britain’s Got Talent finalists. Simon Cowell , Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon , and Bruno Tonioli returned to their judging duties tonight as eight acts took to the stage, all hoping to win over the public. These acts were: Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust, and Innocent Masuku. However, only two could go through to the final, and they were Innocent Masuku and Ssaulabi Performance Troupe. Opera singing powerhouse Innocent received the most votes from the public, sending him straight through after an incredible closing performance. Meanwhile, dog act The Trickstars and martial arts stars Sslaubi Performance Troupe found themselves in the top 3, meaning the judges had the power to choose who went through. While the panel heaped praise on both acts, it ended up being a clean sweep, as all four voted in favour of Ssaulabi Performance Troupe. This means they now have a chance to follow in the footsteps of last year’s winner, comedy clown Viggo Venn. Alas, dog training act The Trickstars suffered yet another blow, as she noted it felt like a repeat of 2016 ‘all over again’, when she also failed to make it to the final. In true BGT style, semi-final week kicked off in utterly chaotic style. Britain's Got Talent star is unrecognisable – and glam to the max – 13 years later BGT auditions conclude with appearance from rarely-seen family members Ant McPartlin reveals Simon Cowell sent him special gift after son's birth Britain's Got Talent fans shocked as four familiar faces return for mind-blowing audition We had rollerblading daredevils Stardust dragging judge Bruno on stage and suspending him in the air as part of their act, plus Sven running riot with his air guitar. Also performing on Monday night’s show were the West End cast of Disney’s award-winning musical The Lion King.

        "content": "When Netflix’s hit series Bridgerton returned for its third season, fans eagerly anticipated the latest romantic escapades and societal intrigues of the Bridgerton family and their peers. However, one noticeable absence was Charithra Chandran‘s character, Edwina Sharma, who had played a significant role in the second season. Recently, Chandran opened up about why Edwina did not return, shedding light on the creative decisions behind her character’s journey. Chandran’s portrayal of Edwina Sharma in the second season captivated audiences with her grace, vulnerability, and the complex dynamics between her, her sister Kate Sharma (played by Simone Ashley), and Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey). Edwina’s storyline, which revolved around a complicated love triangle, culminated in her stepping back to allow her sister and Anthony to embrace their true feelings for each other. In an interview with the Indian Express in 2022, Chandran reflected on Edwina’s character, saying starring in Bridgerton “is absolutely a burden and a blessing. I think it’s about picking diverse roles that are really different from it and building out a career that doesn’t rely too much on the flagship show that launched me. But I’m so grateful for it. It was such a wonderful experience and I have great things to say about it.” She added, “I’m not on set for season 3. I’m doing another film. It hasn’t been announced yet. It’s really exciting!” Over the past one and a half years, she has announced many projects, including producing a reality show based on the Kama Sutra. She is also set to star in Arzu, a drama based on the novel of the same name, as a young Indian heiress who leaves Mumbai for New York City. She also starred in the film How To Date Billy Walsh, which premiered on Prime Video last month. The actress was aware that the success that came with Bridgerton could be fleeting. “I’ve potentially had the biggest success, in my professional life, in the second thing I’ve ever done,” Chandran said in an interview. She continued, “I’m not saying I’ll never do anything grander than Bridgerton. I hope that’s not the case – and I have big ambitions. It’s just rather bizarre that it was the beginning of my career. I think it has really warped my sense of achievement.”",

        "content": "When Herby Caillot was released from the Massachusetts prison system in 2019 after serving 22 years for first-degree murder, he had to start from scratch to establish himself financially. He had been locked up since he was 17 years old and had never paid a bill or used a credit card. The bank across the street from his mother’s house in Brockton wouldn’t let him open a checking account; car dealerships turned him down for financing. “Without any credit history,” he said, “nobody’s even looking at you.” People who have been incarcerated face numerous challenges when they return to society, especially when it comes to getting a job and finding a place to live. Sometimes a few thousand dollars can make all the difference, providing a way to buy a car to get to work or put down a security deposit on an apartment. But with a criminal record and no recent employment or credit history, many lenders won’t approve funding, or will only grant it with a sky-high interest rate. Some people have had their identities stolen while they’re behind bars, making it even more difficult to establish credit. Advertisement A nonprofit being launched in Boston in July, with help from an investment by the GreenLight Fund, aims to fill this need by offering low-interest loans of up to $15,000, along with financial planning and community support, for formerly incarcerated residents. Boston will be the fifth market for the Fountain Fund , which was founded in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., and has issued 500 loans — typically for a three-year term with 5 percent interest — totaling more than $2.25 million. Applicants with any type of conviction are eligible, but they must have a job that will allow them to pay back the loan and show that the funds will provide a “potential elevation in their personal circumstances,” such as paying off a debt, getting their car insured, or starting a business. Advertisement Orlando Barbour used his $15,000 loan to buy a box truck and equipment to start a moving company in Charlottesville, Va. Barbour, 32, served five years for selling cocaine and meth, and now has two full-time employees. But getting the loan didn’t come easy, he said. He had to show pay stubs from his job driving a bread delivery truck and present a business plan for his company, Smoov Moving, complete with financial projections. The loan gave him a running start, he said, but the support the nonprofit gave him, along with the networking opportunities, was just as important: “Just having someone who believes in you.” The Fountain Fund staff reviews applicants closely, examining their income and monthly bills before presenting cases to a loan review committee made up of formerly incarcerated people and community leaders, said Jay Vilar, the former program director at Haley House in Boston, who was just named director of the local Fountain Fund. The money is paid directly to landlords, car dealerships, and other vendors, said Vilar, 45, who lives in Roxbury and has an older brother who has been in and out of prison. The nonprofit also partners with community organizations that provide financial literacy training for loan recipients, each of whom must complete an FDIC financial education course online. At Haley House, a nonprofit that runs a soup kitchen and provides other social services, Vilar oversaw a re-entry program for recently incarcerated residents and found plenty of assistance but nothing that gave them immediate access to money. This can drive people to fall back into their old ways to survive, he said, causing them to end up back in prison. Advertisement Many of those who have served time can’t rely on relatives for financial help, said Kristine McDonald , a Brockton attorney who works with people returning from incarceration through the Massachusetts Communities Action Network, a network of faith-based leaders and community organizers dedicated to economic justice and racial equity. “This is a demographic that has been denied generational wealth,” she said. “All of the economic injustices that have been perpetuated for generations and generations of Black and brown people are very much at play.” When Dormen Lisby first tried to buy a car after serving 26 years in prison in Pennsylvania, the dealership would only offer him financing with a 25 percent interest rate. So Lisby, who lives in Philadelphia, turned to the Fountain Fund, which gave him a $13,000 loan — with 3 percent interest — to buy a 2014 Nissan Maxima. Lisby, 52, uses the car to get to work as a program specialist for Shining Light, a nonprofit that provides re-entry programming inside prisons, and take his mother to the hospital for cancer treatments. He also uses it as a “tool of wellness,” rolling down the windows, cranking up the stereo, and going wherever he pleases. Advertisement “To be able to drive,” he said, “is the ultimate expression of freedom.” Katie Johnston can be reached at katie.johnston@globe.com . Follow her @ktkjohnston .",

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",

The 46-year-old royal stunned in a Summer ensemble, sporting a baby blue floral dress midi dress with matching blue heels. Her frock, which featured a gathered design around the lower waist and short sleeves, bore an elegant botanical print with pink flowers and green leaves. Mother-of-three Victoria co-ordinated her dress with a simple pair of heeled pumps in a matching shade of blue. She wore her brown locks pulled into a chic low bun, and opted for a natural make-up look, with a clear complexion, light eye-make-up, and a pink lip. Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden (pictured) was stylish in a baby blue dress featuring a botanical print as she visited The Nordic Museum in Stockholm today The royal (pictured) paired the elegant midi dress with a pair of simple heeled pumps in the same shade of blue The finishing touches to her ensemble included a few pieces of carefully curated jewellery. Among them were a classic silver wrist watch, a platinum ring on her ring finger, and a pair of colourful statement earrings, which matched the palette of her dress. Victoria was greeted at the museum's entrance by its director Sanne Houby-Nielsen, ahead of her attendance at the Friends of The Nordic Museum and Skansen at The Nordic Museum meeting. The royal has been a member and First Honorary Member of the association since 1997. Skansen describes itself as 'the world's oldest open-air museum, showcasing the whole of Sweden with houses, animals and traditions from every part of the country'. Carrying a bouquet of delicate white flowers, the Princess was snapped as she shook hands with Sanne Houby-Nielsen, along with Skansen director Maria Groop, Russel, director of operations Clara Block-Hane, and chairman Hans Malmsten. The Summery look complements her outfits from previous years where she has worn a similarly floral frock of varying colours. Last year, she looked perfectly chic in a matching floral white and grey blouse and skirt from the Scandinavian fashion brand, Malina. The royal opted for natural make-up and a simple, stylish low bun to complement her floral frock during her outing today The mother-of-three (pictured, left) is photographed while being greeted by Sanne Houby-Nielsen, director of the Nordic Museum (pictured, right) Her appearance today follows another recent outing. Last week, the Crown Princess attended World Wildlife Fund (WWF) event with her dog Rio. The organisation, which focuses its work on protecting the environment and nature, hosted in annual event in Stockholm. Dressed casually in a purple parka jacket and fitted green trousers, the royal rode the ferry where she visited the Nämdöskärgården National Park on the archipelago of Nämdö. Once slipping off her parka, the Princess revealed a magnificent queen silk blouse which was open necked. As a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, Victoria has long been committed to causes including sustainability and climate action.

In attendance for the final on Saturday 11 May, she opened the ceremony with a pre-recorded speech to the hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide. The royal appeared to be following in the footsteps of the Princess of Wales, who opened the song contest in Liverpool last year with a touching piano performance tribute to Ukraine. Victoria looked chic in a pale pink suit, which she paired with a white blouse and stilettos in the short clip. She appeared to be standing in one of the main rooms in the Palace, revealing the opulent decorations and a large bouquet of flowers placed behind her.

        "description": "Portraying the separation of the capital-gains measures into a stand-alone bill as a shrewd political strategy to trap Conservatives distracts from the reality",
        "content": "The justifies the increased capital-gains inclusion rate (from one-half to two-thirds) on fairness grounds, asserting that only 0.13 per cent of Canadians with the highest incomes are expected to realize gains exceeding the $250,000 annual threshold. Even though it is now apparent the capital-gains tax increase will adversely affect many ordinary Canadians as well, in his recent Justin Trudeau has doubled down on this equity rationale, saying as he did in 2015 that the richest few should pay a little more. proposes the implementing legislation for many of the budget measures but conspicuously omits the contentious capital-gains provisions, for which important details still remain unknown as the effective date of June 25 approaches. Chrystia Freeland promises a separate bill on capital gains before the summer, which she says will force Conservatives to take a stand on tax fairness. This is disingenuous in two respects. Portraying the separation of the capital-gains measures into a stand-alone bill as a shrewd political strategy to trap Conservatives distracts from the reality: They were evidently a last-minute budget addition to raise revenue and contain this year’s deficit at the promised $40-billion cap. It’s clear that the technical amendments were not released with the budget because the Department of Finance was not given enough time to prepare them and they still are not ready. Moreover, the Liberals are framing support for the capital-gains tax increase as a choice exclusively about fairness, and in particular how progressive our income tax system should be. They argue that our already steeply progressive taxes – where higher rates apply to higher thresholds of income – should be torqued further, even though the already bear 22.5 per cent of all income taxes paid, and the . But this obsessive Liberal focus on their highly progressive version of tax equity obscures other important objectives of sound tax policy. These include ensuring Canada’s tax system is competitive with other countries, promotes capital investment and productivity improvements, and minimizes unwarranted complexity of compliance and administration. The capital-gains proposals arguably fail on all counts. In one respect, an increased capital-gains inclusion rate could possibly be justified on equity grounds not because it exacerbates progressivity so the richest Canadians pay more, but rather because it better measures a taxpayer’s ability to pay, regardless of income level. The base of our income tax to which progressively increasing tax rates apply is “income,” which is comprised of incomes from all sources plus, since 1972, one-half of gains from dispositions of capital properties. The in 1966 had recommended adoption of a comprehensive income base including 100 per cent of realized capital gains as a suitable measure of a taxpayer’s economic power, because “a buck is a buck is a buck,” but in conjunction with much-reduced marginal rates and more generous income averaging. In part to minimize the adverse impact on capital investment, and in part to avoid taxing nominal gains because of inflation, the government of the day instead adopted the arbitrary 50-per-cent inclusion rate for capital gains. Fiscal pressures led to this being increased to two-thirds in 1988, then to 75 per cent in 1990, and then returned to its present 50 per cent in 2000. There is thus no magic to any particular capital-gains inclusion rate. The policy goal is to appropriately estimate a taxpayer’s ability to pay without taxing inflationary gains or undermining incentives to invest in capital properties. The Carter Commission’s advice was to broaden the base (by increasing the capital-gains inclusion rate), and also to lower the rate of tax that applies to income as comprehensively determined. The Liberals are proposing only to broaden the base, but not to lower the overall rate, which for income over $247,000 is an excessively high 53.5 per cent for an Ontario-resident individual. This heightens the risks to capital investment that so many commentators have warned about. It is also arguably unnecessary because of the separate tightening of the alternative minimum tax base, which as of 2024 will now include 100 per cent of capital gains in any event. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is facing to take a position on the capital-gains issue. Canadians should reject the Liberal framing as a question solely of tax fairness, for unneeded enhancements to our already steeply progressive income tax system. The Liberals’ capital-gains proposal should be opposed on wider tax policy grounds, particularly its damaging impact on Canada’s already troubled investment climate. And whenever the draft legislation is eventually released, it is unlikely to reduce complexity of the tax system for ordinary Canadians.",

        "content": "Back in 2021 when Jordan Love was signed by the Green Bay Packers, not many expected the QB to be as good as he is today. After spending the first two seasons in Aaron Rodgers’ shadow, Love had a coming of age last season with 32 TDs scored and 4,159 yards covered. His exploits last season have raised his stocks considerably in the NFL with many DEs being varied. However, there is a debutant DE this season who Jordan Love will be acquainted with. The DE is Ron Stone Jr., Jordan’s girlfriend’s brother. The 24-year-old Defensive End is entering the NFL on the back of a stellar campaign for Washington State . To put things into context, last season saw Ron record his career-best numbers of 60 tackles, 11 for a loss, and 5.0 sacks. These exploits have thus landed him in the NFL with the Las Vegas Raiders taking a punt on Ron. The WSU alum’s signing has been a matter of excitement for the Raiders fandom as he comes with an extensive experience of 5 years. Moreover, veteran ESPN analyst Mel Kiper also rated him as the 25th-best outside linebacker among active players in the collegiate circuit. Factor in his versatility in the defense line and Ron Stone becomes a rock-solid partner for the Raiders’ superstar DE Maxx Crosby. All said, the Raiders with Ron’s signing have certainly added an element of youthfulness and vigor to their backline. This particularly bodes well for Las Vegas when facing teams led by accomplished QBs, especially against the likes of Patrick Mahomes with whom there seems to be a rivalry brewing. Crosby’s Raiders Vs Jordan Love’s Packers, The Next Big Rivalry? For the last four decades, the Raiders vs Packers game has been one-way traffic favoring Green Bay . It was only last season that the Raiders broke their duck of losing eight straight games against the Packers with a 17-13 victory. Considering the constant humiliation that the Raiders face from the Packers, the rivalry will now get more spicy with Ron Stone Jr. in the mix. On the one hand, the Las Vegas Raiders will be fighting for their pride, while Jordan Love, on the other hand, will be fighting to not lose his domination. The Packers QB in particular would be hoping to not lose to his potential brother-in-law, adding more layers to this budding rivalry. Unfortunately for us, we can only dream of this match for the time being, as the Raiders won’t be taking on the Packers in the regular season this year. However, both teams have been heralded by many as the dark horses for the Super Bowl this time. Thus it would be a delight if the two teams were to lock horns in the playoffs this time raising the stakes even higher.",

        "content": "Janhvi Kapoor is currently awaiting the release of her next ‘Mr & Mrs Mahi’ which also stars Rajkummar Rao in the lead role. Janhvi Kapoor recently opened up about how doctors had advised her to not play cricket post the injury she had on the sets of her upcoming film. Janhvi underwent rigorous training and the intense cricket practice caused her to dislocate her shoulder twice. Talking to Bollywood Bubble, Janhvi revealed that the doctor had advised her to not play cricket. She stated that when she dislocated her shoulder for the first time, she thought it might be a fluke or she was overworked. But the second time around, when she had the second dislocation, nearly three months after the first, she consulted a shoulder specialist. She revealed that the specialist told her that she had multi-directional instability which meant that she was the worst candidate for cricket. The specialist even advised Janhvi that she shouldn’t be playing cricket all her life because she is very susceptible to dislocations. Janhvi recalled that despite the injuries she had to train, however, she had a strategy. Every time they had to train to play cricket, Jahvi taped up her shoulders to keep it in place. “I had a cap of about 60 balls but we ended up reaching 100 balls a day. I could not even play with a season ball so the team had even changed to a machine ball,” she recalled.",

        "content": "By For all of the impressive accolades and championships that Tom Brady accumulated over the course of his legendary career, a vocal smattering of critics will continue to bring up “Deflategate” and Brady’s role in the onerous drama as a blemish on his legacy. But don’t count former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce among those who still dredge up “Deflategate” as a strike against Brady’s sterling career on the gridiron. On the contrary, Kelce defended Brady — admitting that he’d also do whatever he could do to gain a slim advantage during a game, while also trivializing just how much impact a slight deflation in footballs would have on a game. “I don’t even think Tom should have gotten in trouble for deflating footballs,” Kelce said. “I’m pro deflating footballs. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I am pro deflating footballs. He outsmarted people. Why the (expletive) does it matter how much air is in that (expletive)? If you’re throwing it and catching it, who the (expletive) cares? ... “We’re all mad because he had the common sense to (expletive) take a little air out so the receivers could catch the (expletive) thing? “Why is that against the rules? Y’all could have taken the air out, too. You guys could have taken the air out, too. You just weren’t smart enough. So why am I getting penalized because you’re (expletive) dummies? It’s a rule, but it’s a stupid rule, though. ... You’re taking away intelligence.” Despite the year-long drama involving Brady, Roger Goodell, the NFL, and “Deflategate”, Brady earned the last laugh after getting hit with a four-game suspension before the 2016 season. Brady went on to win three more Super Bowls between the Patriots (LI, LIII) and Buccaneers (LV) after that suspension — with the former QB “Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent 20 million dollars and found that it was ‘more probable than not’ that I was ‘generally aware’ that someone may have deflated my footballs,” Brady said during the Netflix special. “You could’ve just given me the 20 million and I would’ve just told you I (expletive) did it.” Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during football season.

        "content": "American flags and flowers adorned grave sites of fallen military members in national cemeteries around the country this Memorial Day . More than 4 million Americans are buried in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' 155 national cemeteries, and thousands of people gathered at 130 of them for sponsored holiday events Monday, which included rifle salutes, patriotic music and, in some locations, an F-16 flyover. \"This day means everything to me,\" said Bill Schultz, who came to visit the gravesites of people buried at Denver, Colorado's Fort Logan National Cemetery. \"Sure, Fourth of July is a great holiday, but Memorial Day is for the heart.\" Fort Logan National Cemetery is named for John Alexander Logan, a commander of the Grand Army of the Republic. In 1868, Logan issued the order to establish the Memorial Day Act to commemorate deceased members of the military by placing flowers on their graves, according to the National Cemetery Administration. For Joyce Prince, Memorial Day carried a special meaning this year, as she recently lost her husband. \"I'm a fairly recent widow — not even two years yet — and it's still very hard to even think of my husband,\" Prince said. \"But I'm proud of him, and I miss him, and it's wonderful to be here with others in the same situation and honoring them is so important.\" Holidays and Celebrations Mikel Burroughs traveled from Texas to Denver to continue a seven-year tradition of laying roses on thousands of gravesites. \"Let's ensure everyone here is remembered, every sacrifice is honored and every grave is adorned with the love and respect it deserves,\" he said. Burroughs' organization, Victory for Veterans, gathered volunteers, including local Boy Scouts, to distribute more than 5,000 roses in the Fort Logan National Cemetery, he said. Burroughs said he coordinated similar efforts at 10 cemeteries across the country including in Texas, Wyoming, Illinois, North Carolina and Minnesota. \"My motivation is pay respect to all our veterans that have passed as well as those that made the ultimate sacrifice and to help with our mission to save our veterans that are struggling with other invisible wounds,\" he said. Hunter Semingsen, a youth member of Mountain View Young Marines, helped set up chairs for the Memorial Day event in Denver. \"I'm a little sad that we have lost so many men and women that have served for our country,\" he said. \"I'm a little bit honored that so many of these men and women served for us.\"",

        "content": "Many coming of age in the 1960s hold a special place in their hearts for Iron Butterfly’s 1968 psychedelic rock anthem “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.” Now, the vocalist, composer and organist behind the mega-hit — Doug Ingle — has died. He was 78. Ingle’s son, Doug Ingle Jr., confirmed his father’s death on social media . “It’s with a heavy heart & great sadness to announce the passing of my father Doug Ingle,” he wrote. “Dad passed away peacefully this evening in the presence of family.” “Thank you Dad for being a father, teacher and friend. Cherished loving memories I will carry the rest of my days moving forward in this journey of life. Love you Dad,” the post continued. Ingle was born in Nebraska and raised in San Diego, forming Iron Butterfly in 1966, according to The Guardian . The band released “Heavy” and then “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” in 1968, the title of the latter being a garbled version of “in the garden of Eden.” Ingle wrote the song while drinking a gallon of wine, the Guardian wrote — hence the garbled title. The original version of the song was 17 minutes before a radio version was slashed down to three. The shorter version of the song reached number 30 on the Billboard top 100 chart. Ingle and Iron Butterfly released two more albums after “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” but neither matched the commercial success of that album. The band was slated to play at the Woodstock festival in 1969, but they wound up getting stranded at New York’s LaGuardia Airport, according to Ultimate Classic Rock . Unfortunately, by 1974, three years after the band broke up, Ingle was in serious debt. “I was a child among men,” Ingle told the Los Angeles Times in the mid-’90s . “I was dealing with people who were competent but not necessarily (working) in my interest. I took the luxury of playing ostrich. I didn’t involve myself at the business level at all. I just went out and performed.” Ingle lost most of his property, including a 600-acre ranch and an apartment building in Woodland Hills, California. He even had to sell his grand piano, according to the Los Angeles Times. Ingle rejoined Iron Butterfly and toured with the band in 1978 and through most of the ‘80s and ‘90s, officially retiring in 1999, according to NBC News . “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” would go on to influence a generation of rockers, and was famously covered by “ The Simpsons .” More music content",

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Four teenagers were killed and another was seriously injured when their truck collided with a semitrailer in rural south-central Wisconsin early Monday. The Dodge County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies responded to the crash just outside Columbus around 4 a.m. An initial investigation shows the teenagers were traveling north in a pickup truck when they ran a stop sign and hit an eastbound semitrailer. The pickup’s driver, a 19-year-old Sun Prairie man, was pronounced dead at the scene. So were a 17-year-old male passenger from Sun Prairie and a 16-year-old male passenger from Madison. An 18-year-old female passenger from Madison died later at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison. Another 18-year-old female passenger from Madison was taken to the same hospital with life-threatening injuries. The semitrailer driver, a 57-year-old man from La Farge, was taken to a hospital in Columbus with minor injuries. The sheriff’s office has not identified anyone involved in the crash, which remains under investigation. Columbus, a city of about 4,000 people, lies about 27 miles (45 kilometers) northeast of Madison, the state capital.",

        "description": "Gardening is a labor of love -- and requires a love of labor. The rewards are the colors and smells and bees ang butterflies, columnist Donna Vickroy says.",
        "content": "Tomato plants in. Flower beds redefined. Debris removed from hostas, lilies and coneflowers. Check. Check. Check. Tilling, pulling, digging, hauling. Gardening is work that never ends. And that’s exactly why I love it. I am a worker. I was raised to be busy. Growing up in a household of eight, if you weren’t doing something, well, you were lazy. Even though it’s been decades since the to-do list exceeded hours in the day, I still struggle with downtime. Coneflowers, seen here in columnist Donna Vickroy’s garden, are not only easy to grow and native to Illinois but they attract all sorts of pollinators. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) Life demands enough thankless work, chores that go uncelebrated but still need to be done. But there also is the work that reaps rewards. The snipping of dead blooms, the thinning of robust lily beds, the trimming of lilacs and spirea. If things go well, all of it will result in loveliness. Temporary loveliness, of course, but loveliness all the same. Peonies popping with brilliant color, tomatoes bursting with flavor, wisteria cascading with purple hues. Even when you fail and your clematis burns up in the sun, you gain knowledge and, thus, the opportunity to start again — in the shade. In 2020, when I decided to retire from full-time writing and people asked, “What will you do now?” I didn’t want to tell them, “Now that I’m grown up, I want to be a gardener.” But then COVID-19 hit and my dad took a turn and suddenly there was endless work and endless obstacles to getting that work done. Even though I didn’t need more to do at the age of 60, I opened the door on gardening, mainly because life was suddenly so stressful and I needed something that brought peace. I’d always been intrigued by gardening and would have dug into it sooner but there were kids to be raised and a career that demanded so much of my time. Back then, domestic duties were given minimal attention. Neglect is a nice euphemism. Foolishly, I thought, once I retired and had some time, I would instantly become a gardener. Ha. Donna Vickroy grew a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes in her garden last summer. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) Gardening takes planning, thoughtfulness, research. It takes strength, patience and humility. And it takes years of practice. It has literally taken me years to learn the identities of plants, let alone their properties. Thank goodness for that iPhone plant identifier. Countless times I have Googled, “Why won’t my peonies bloom?” “Where should I plant daisies?” “Should I deadhead black-eyed Susans?” I only recently learned about the importance of removing suckers from tomato plants and how to harvest basil properly. The journey has been a humbling one, fraught with failure, wasted funds and countless blisters, sunburns and thorn-like injuries. I now understand that I likely won’t live long enough to be really good at this. But that’s OK. I like that the endeavor is bigger than me. I like that the discipline requires ongoing investigation, not to mention trial and error. Mostly, I like that the endeavor is worthwhile. Not only does it reap a harvest of color, it enables me to give the earth something it appreciates. Years ago, while helping tend to my dad’s backyard veggie plot, he told me, “If you want the earth to work for you, you have to work for it.” In exploring the world of local fauna, I have discovered much about myself: How much I don’t mind dirt or worms or the occasional tortoise that crosses the border from the nearby wetlands; how much I like to collapse into the bed at night because I worked so hard all day; and, how much of a social media show-off I can be — did you catch the photo of my peonies? I was nervous that the supersonic cicada emergence would be more than I could handle, but so far I haven’t spied a single one in my yard. When we walk the dog, they’re all over the sidewalks of other neighborhoods but it seems ours has been spared. Bee balm flowers not only bring color and aroma to your garden, they live up to their name. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) And so my work continues. Hauling hoses, pulling buckthorn and sticker weeds, and trying desperately to keep the coleus happy. It is a never-ending job but it also is a labor of love. I love when the wild geranium loses control and has to be cut back. I love when the bee balm lives up to its name. I love when the cherry tomato harvest is so robust that I have to stand and eat them off the stalks to maintain order. And I love the creativity gardening affords. I put together a fairy garden for my grandchildren. I relegated a portion of my new perennial garden to milkweed. And, last year, I scattered wildflower seeds across the railroad garden, which backs up to a heavily traversed walkway. By mid-July, the trains were circling a small meadow. I love when the honeysuckle vines leap, their blooms becoming a siren for hummingbirds. And I especially love when finches, butterflies and bees come to feast and join the show. I will never be an expert. My home will never make the garden club circuit. And there will always be something that’s failing, struggling or completely out of place. But they are my gardens. And I am proud to be at their service.",

        "description": "The High Court quashed an order of Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj barring them from taking part in execution of various public works",
        "content": "The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Monday allowed contractors, who were delisted for being relatives of militants and separatists, “to participate in the tendering process” and quashed an order of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. “I find merit in these petitions...The impugned communication dated March 15, 2023, issued by the commissioner/secretary, Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, is quashed. The respondents shall permit the petitioners to participate in the tendering process,” Justice Sanjeev Kumar said. Justice Kumar was hearing a number of petitions where local contractors pleaded that they were denied permission to participate in a government tendering process for allegedly being related to militants or separatists. “Evidently, the competent authority has not proposed the cancellation or refusal to renew the certificates of registration issued in favour of the petitioners. Simply, because one or more relatives of the petitioners were involved in anti-national activities in early 1990s or thereafter cannot be a ground to deprive the petitioners of their right to enter into contracts with government for execution of various public works,” Justice Kumar held. The Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj in 2023 debarred a number of local contractors from participating in the process of government tendering on the basis of the communication received from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Jammu and Kashmir, wherein they “failed the security test”. The CID report suggested that “close relatives of the petitioners, i.e. brother, cousin, uncle, nephew, maternal uncle, father’s maternal uncle, father etc. had in the past remained involved in subversive activities. Some of the relatives indicated in the remarks column of the verification reports are dead for the last couple of decades. “I am of the considered opinion that the impugned communication not only violates the fundamental right of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, but it has also the effect of depriving the petitioners of their right to livelihood implicit in Article 21. The relevant extract of Article 19 i.e. 19(1)(g) and 19(6),” the court observed. Fundamental rights Justice Kumar further held that in a democracy, as we are, governed by rule of law and no authority, however high and mighty it may be, cannot be permitted to subvert the constitutional provisions. “The fundamental rights, which form the bedrock of rule of law, cannot be permitted to be tampered with in the manner it has been done by the commissioner/secretary, Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj,” the court observed. Referring to the 2010 rehabilitation policy for former militants in Kashmir who crossed into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Justice Kumar said, “To such a blatant violation of fundamental rights of the citizens, this court cannot remain a mute spectator. It may not be out of sync to point out that with a view to rehabilitating former militants/surrendered militants, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir has been promulgating rehabilitation policies.” The policy was intended to facilitate the return of former militants who belonged to the Jammu and Kashmir and had crossed over to PoK/Pakistan for training in insurgency but later gave up insurgent activities due to change of heart. “The intent and objective of the rehabilitation policies issued by the government from time to time was to bring the misguided youth and others, who had strayed into militancy but had realised their mistake, into the mainstream. The impugned communication issued by the then commissioner/secretary, Rural Development department and Panchayati Raj, is clear onslaught on the well thought after and wise decisions taken by the government to bring peace and normalcy in the then State of Jammu and Kashmir, now Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” the court observed. ‘Filmsy ground’ Justice Kumar said, “I have not been able to discern the thought process that might have gone into the mind of the then commissioner/secretary to issue such communication. They [contractors] were debarred from executing works of the Rural Development department on a flimsy ground that their uncle or even father’s uncle 10/20 years ago were involved in anti-national activities. As is evident from the CID report, most of the relatives of the petitioners named therein have either died or surrendered to make a new beginning as law- abiding citizens of this country.” The court held that it was a matter of “very serious nature”. “Let a copy of this judgment be placed before the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, for initiating departmental action against the concerned commissioner/secretary. A report with regard to action taken shall be submitted by the Chief Secretary to this court within a period of two months,” the court held. The court listed the case for July 29, 2024. Under the 2010 rehabilitation policy for militants, official figures suggest over 212 people returned from PoK through Nepal and other routes between 2010 and 2012, against 219 cases approved after security clearance.

According to Carlos, the media and fans tried to destroy Vinicius during his early days at Real Madrid, which has made the Brazil international even stronger. Speaking to the media at a recent event, Carlos said via TheMadridZone, that it would be natural for Vinicius to win the top individual prestigious award. “They tried to destroy Vini when he was young and that made him stronger,” the former defender said of Vinicius. “There are other great players, but we needed a player like Vini. If he continues like this, it will be natural for him to win the Ballon d’Or.” Vinicius has been impressive for Real Madrid this season. He has already helped Los Blancos win La Liga and has played a key role in taking them to the UEFA Champions League final where they will face Borussia Dortmund.

        "description": "The one-of-a-kind champion turned broadcaster never left the public eye but still nobody knew of his fight.",
        "content": "Two-time NBA champion Bill Walton, who dominated the hard court during a 13-year pro basketball career and later excelled as a broadcaster, has died after a “prolonged” battle with cancer. The 71-year-old was with his family when he died, NBA spokesperson Mark Broussard said in a statement. Walton led the Portland Trail Blazers to an NBA championship in 1977 and won a second NBA title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today And after a 13-year career on the hardwood, Walton moved into the media. “(He) translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colourful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said. Former ESPN commentator JA Adande said “‘I’m much better at getting high than getting low’ might be the ultimate Bill Walton quote”. “I never saw him ‘low’, no matter how much his chronically bad back might have been bothering him. I assume now he had cancer when I saw him in February. Couldn’t tell,” Walton was a high school phenom before he went to play for coach John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins. There, Walton won three consecutive National College Player of the Year awards between 1972 and 1974 and helped lead the Bruins to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973. Off the court, Walton became one of the most polarising athletes in the country with his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War, the Nixon administration and the FBI. He was even arrested at a war protest during his junior year. With a shock of flame red hair, Walton also broke the mould for what a college athlete should look like with his multicolored headbands and flannel shirts. He declared himself a vegetarian, practised meditation and became a lifelong fan of The Grateful Dead. “Your generation has screwed up the world,” he said in a statement after his arrest. “My generation is trying to straighten it out. Money doesn’t mean anything to me. It can’t buy happiness, and I just want to be happy.” Being happy to Walton meant to pursue an NBA career. Selected as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton led the Trail Blazers to a championship three years later and also won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. In 1978, Walton won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player Award. But from high school through the rest of his career, Walton was dogged by foot and leg injuries that forced him to play through the pain. He missed three seasons because of injuries that required some three dozen surgeries to correct. At age 34, Walton retired after playing just 10 games of the 1986-87 season. In his autobiography, Walton wrote that his biggest regret was playing hurt. “I didn’t let pain be my guide. I didn’t say, ‘If it hurt a lot, don’t play,” Walton wrote. But Walton was not done with basketball. A stutterer, Walton overcame his speech impediment to become one of the country’s best-known — and sometimes controversial — basketball commentators. Walton called games for NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, ESPN, Turner Sports and, most recently, provided commentary for ESPN broadcasts of Pac-12 basketball. In 2001, Walton received an Emmy for best live sports television broadcast. Along the way, Walton built a collection of outlandish quips, some of which were compiled online by an outfit called Awful Announcing. “Come on, that was no foul,” Walton once declared mid-game. “It may be a violation of all the basic rules of human decency, but it’s not a foul.” Walton once likened a player to a mosquito. “If you ever think you’re too small to make a difference, you’ve never spent a night in bed with a mosquito, or you’ve never played basketball against Taylor from Utah — No. 11 in your program, No. 1 in your heart,” he said. Walton could also go over the top with praise. For example: “John Stockton is one of the true marvels, not just of basketball, or in America, but in the history of Western civilisation!” Walton is survived by his second wife, Lori, and his sons from his first marriage: Adam, Luke, Nate and Chris, according to the NBA.",

        "content": "Jo Aleh and Molly Meech competing in Marseille last year. Photo: Getty Images By Dana Johannsen Yachting NZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections after one of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games, despite failing to meet the required performance standard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up in the 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined the announcement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Games last month. With five previous Games appearances and three Olympic medals between them, the pair are the most experienced of the nine-strong team named thus far. But according to Yachting NZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to be considered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10 placing at one of the designated selection regattas. The selection was signed off by the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamant proper process was followed in the nomination and selection of the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparent willingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech, along with a perceived inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes over its handling of selections and allegations of bias. Secret selection criteria leaked Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak of secrecy around how it selects its athletes for the Olympic Games. It is the only national body that does not publicly share its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC's nomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing to be considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep it confidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of the selection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clear an even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\" criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primary selection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominate athletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To be eligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline, achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta, or have medalled at a world championships during that Olympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailors or crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emerging talent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors need to finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selection regattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailing partner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly, won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver in Rio. Meech was also a silver medallist in Rio, alongside teammate Alex Maloney in the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separate ways following a disappointing 12th place finish in Tokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginning of 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite their credentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results on the international circuit. In the first of two selection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at the European Championships in Portugal last year - well outside the top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the World Championships earlier this year. Prior to being named in the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just one top 10 result at a major international regatta in two-and-a-half seasons - a sixth placing at the 2023 world championships. It is understood selectors relied heavily on this result, despite it not being an official selection regatta. Under the criteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew's track record of success at past Olympic Games\". However, those familiar with the policy say these factors only come into play in final deliberations once sailors have met the underlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken with several past and present members of the NZL sailing team, who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of this year's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fear of being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made a point of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFX pair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme of the conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceived inconsistent approach to its selections has created distrust in the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into the debate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, but told RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection, having had close friends impacted by selection policies in the past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happy to be selected and for us it was just a little step on the way to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus is very much on making sure we are doing everything we can over the next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named in the Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough result last month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming the bronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning to perfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone's reading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied an extraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meech in the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ, Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisation does not publicly comment on individual nominations, but all sailors and crews were selected in line with its policies. The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process led by an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertise and experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicol also asserted proper process was followed. \"All selections are made by an experienced selection panel. Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by [national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOC selectors against the agreed nomination criteria and the NZOC selection policy,\" she said in a statement. Selection discretion: Pedigree vs potential The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meech appears not to have been as readily available to others. RNZ understands at least one sailor - kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appeal with the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the new Olympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympic pole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke out about the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy, arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to the Olympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will be heard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in the meantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when a case is before the tribunal, but it is understood Walton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emerging talent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected under this criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women's IQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to be confirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesday morning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall at her two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16 nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky start to her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in the first two selection events earlier this year, before pulling it out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month. There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14th nation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focus on the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th at his three selection regattas. His 17th placing at the European Championships last year put him inside the top 16 nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28 year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. He finished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninth nation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships (15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event, Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next, I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let's see.\" 'Rigid' with rules 'when it suits them' One former international sailor said the governing body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\" approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, but also funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\" development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules to the absolute letter when it suits them. We're always being told, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when they want to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all this grey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directly address questions related to whether he has concerns about perceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. But in a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are \"transparent and available to every athlete throughout their campaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of the organisation also said the current policy was \"developed after an athlete-led review following the Tokyo Olympic Games\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refining the policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignored questions about whether the NZOC had any concerns about Yachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we are not able to comment on individual cases, we do understand how tough it is for athletes that may not have been nominated by their sport for selection to an NZ Team.\" It is not the first time questions have been raised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections for pinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) and Natalia Kosinska (RS:X) took cases to the Sports Tribunal over their non-nomination for the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruled in favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitration body Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport's handling of selections. \"I have concerns about the inadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. While the selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretion to YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide by the rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness in its implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in his decision.",

        "content": "Image credit: (Photo by Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images) Here’s a take: College baseball’s selection committee largely got it right this year. I just last night argued it made a mistake in choosing East Carolina as a host over Dallas Baptist and I still believe that. But taken in totality, the committee did a good job. Eleven bids for the SEC? The right decision. Leaving Charleston and Northeastern out, making the Coastal Athletic Association a one-bid league? The right decision. Indiana and Georgia Tech in? The right decision. Cal and Lamar out? The right decision. I would have taken TCU instead of Kansas State. Oklahoma State should be seeded higher than Oklahoma, a team the Cowboys went 4-1 against. But reasonable people can disagree about all of this. The problem, however, is that the selection committee is taking a ton of heat right now because of a perception problem. The committee is composed of sitting college baseball administrators — this year it’s 10 athletic directors — and, unluckily, this year a lot of those committee members had teams that fell on the bubble of something — the top-eight seeds, hosting or the tournament field. And just about every decision that involved one of those schools went in a favorable direction for those teams. The NCAA sets rules and procedures that all of its selection committees have to follow in such cases. If a committee member’s school is ever up for discussion, that person must leave the room and they are not a part of any voting in the debate. But what does that look like in practice? We don’t know. We don’t know a lot about the selection process and that’s a problem, even if it’s only a problem of perception and that, in fact, the procedures put in place to safeguard the system are working perfectly. The process is inherently subjective. This is not professional sports, where teams are playing uniform, consistent schedules, meaning that it’s entirely reasonable to build a playoff field out of division winners and then a few more teams that had the best records. And when the selection committee leans too heavily on RPI – one of the most objective tools it has at its disposal (it might be flawed, but it’s literally just an algorithm that doesn’t care what conference you represent or how big your stadium is) – people get mad. When the selection committee deviates from RPI, people also get mad. What this process needs more than anything is more transparency. Good luck even finding who is on the committee in any given year. The NCAA website is a nightmare to navigate and a lot of information is truly buried. Last month, a major conference head coach reached out to me to ask who was on the baseball committee. I’m always happy when coaches come to me for information, but in this case, that’s not a good sign. College baseball is becoming too big of a deal for its current process. The basketball selection committee releases its full seed list, 1-68. Baseball won’t even tell us what team is No. 17 or No. 65. Every selection committee I’ve ever talked to says the regional advisory committees (which are supposed to be their version of the eye test) are an important part of the process. I’d love to know how the RAC lined up the Big 12 teams. Is that why Kansas State was selected instead of TCU (which had better metrics) or Cincinnati or Kansas (which both had better conference records)? Show me the goods. College football and basketball both have in-season releases of the committee rankings (football does a Top 25 weekly down the stretch, while basketball shows a release of the top four seeds in each region once). Those are both mostly just content made for the TV partners. But they do at least give some early insight into the committees’ thinking. Committee chairman Matt Hogue on Monday was asked if baseball had explored something similar. He said they hadn’t to this point, but believed it would help drive interest to baseball. There are a number of ways the baseball committee could provide more clarity to the process. Instead, it remains largely a black box and that allows conspiracy theories to run rampant. Some, like the importance of having a team or league representative on the selection committee, have at least some correlating evidence, even if causality is impossible to prove. Others, like agendas for or against the SEC or Pac-12, appear to be essentially baseless. But they’re out there and they’re eroding confidence in the selection committee. Maybe it’s unreasonable to think these are solvable problems. Again, this is an inherently subjective process that gets harder every year because of conference consolidation and the increasing attention and money in the sport. Missing the tournament is more likely to have consequences for programs and coaches today than it did even 10 years ago, let alone 25 years ago. But bringing some sunshine into the committee room couldn’t hurt.",

        "description": "After a year where multiple natural disasters hit HRM, city staff is now working on enhancing its emergency management program after receiving an assessment report.",
        "content": "Findings of a report determining the state of HRM’s emergency management program was presented to Halifax’s Executive Standing Committee on Monday. The Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) framework was used to make the assessment, hoping to build the best possible emergency management program. “We have a lot of experience responding to emergencies,” said HRM Community Safety Executive Director Bill Moore. “We have a lot of very, very good staff doing a lot of really, really good work. This is not a reflection of that. This is about building the program around it.” HRM CAO Cathie O’Toole told the executive standing committee that assessing the maturity of emergency management for the city was her priority when she entered her role. The report shows the HRM’s emergency management program lacks documentation and structure and needs a multi-year strategic plan. Story continues below advertisement “Right now, we are strong in terms of the fact that we have good people and we are well practiced in terms of responding to emergencies,” said O’Toole. “The resilience piece, though, is of particular concern because without the documentation and without the training, then we may not be resilient if we lost two or three key individuals.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. The report came as a bit of a surprise to some councillors who believed the program was in good order, who now welcome the changes.

Border intelligence program needs better training, analytics: evaluation Canada needs to do more to disaster-proof its hospitals, experts say “I was pleased to see that some of the work was done in 2020 to get some of the documentation back up, but that so much of that had fallen behind,” said HRM District 15 Coun. Paul Russell. “I’m also pleased to hear that...we’re moving ahead with that.” The internationally recognized EMAP set of standards used to assess and continuously improve emergency management programs will allow for plans to be updated regularly while providing a roadmap for building the program in the future.

Having managed the way through at least four emergency events last year, approval from the Executive Standing Committee for the report recommendations allows City Staff to begin strategic planning. Story continues below advertisement “We need to make sure that the plans are actually going to be able to be put into operations,” Moore said. “So, that involves talking with a whole lot of stakeholders, communities, levels of government, First Nations communities, private businesses.” This work is a result of questions raised from the wildfires after-action report, which Moore told Global News his team is taking very seriously as they make sure to build those recommendations into the municipality’s program.

        "content": "Two days after the Rajkot blaze, forensic experts have been able to establish identities from DNA samples of only 13 of the 27 completely charred bodies recovered from the site of the TRP Game Zone fire. Of the 13 identified, seven bodies have been handed over to the victims’ families, Rajkot Collector Prabhav Joshi told The Indian Express . “Those remaining will be handed over in the morning as requested by the families. These have been kept in the cold room facility at the Rajkot Civil hospital and AIIMS,” Joshi said. The seven victims whose bodies have been handed over to the families are Satyapalsinh Chhatrapalsinh Jadeja (17), Smit Manishbhai Vala, Sunilbhai Hasmukhbhai Siddhpura (45), Jignesh Kalubhai Gadhavi, Omdevsinh Gajendrasinh Gohil (35), Vishvarajsinh Jasubha Jadeja (23) and Ashaben Chandubhai Kathad (38). Advertisement DNA sampling was necessitated after the bodies were charred beyond recognition. However, according to sources, the bodies were charred to such an extent that there was no fluid remaining for even easy DNA sampling. Some of the bodies were dismembered, too, they added. “Blood is required for extracting DNA samples from a dead body, but in the Rajkot incident, there was no blood (left in the bodies). So, the bones of the deceased were sent immediately to Gandhinagar FSL by an air ambulance to save time,” stated Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi, who visited the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar on Monday to review the investigation. Also Read | No fire clearance: Rajkot game zone kept flying under radar for 3 years He added that a team of more than 18 members “is working day and night to get the bodies of the deceased to their families as soon as possible”. The blaze that broke out on May 25 had claimed 28 lives, including seven minors. So far, the remains of all but one missing person have been found. Advertisement “Some of the DNA samples have been identified today (Monday). The process of DNA analysis is underway and it is expected to confirm the remaining samples as early as possible, likely by tonight,” a senior official confirmed to The Indian Express. According to Sanghavi, the FSL started working from 5 am Sunday. The first DNA samples to arrive were blood and post-mortem samples. “This operation has to be done in eight stages — from extracting the DNA samples to the final report. At each stage, the duration of the test is determined based on the type of the sample,” he said. Some of the hard tissue samples are estimated to take around 36-48 hours to be identified. Advertisement In the first stage that takes around six to seven hours, the case opening process is carried out for analysis of samples for testing, the minister explained. The second step, which also takes nearly six to seven hours, involves extracting DNA from the samples. The third step is to check the quantity and quality of the DNA. This takes around three to four hours, the minister said. “Then PCR (Polmerase Chain Reaction) of the DNA samples, i.e., DNA enrichment process is carried out under the fourth step. It is a three-four-hour process. The fifth stage involves DNA profiling, which takes approximately eight to nine hours. The DNA profile obtained under the sixth phase is analyzed, which takes two to three hours. In addition, the interpretation of the analyzed samples is done in the seventh phase that takes around six to seven hours, and the DNA report is prepared under the final and eighth phase that takes nearly three to five hours,” Sanghavi explained. On Sunday, Rajkot Collector Prabhav Joshi had said, “Despite some identification evidence on the bodies, like rings and bangles, the government decided on DNA analysis for scientific identification so that there is no mistake in handing over the bodies.”",

        "content": "As the Trudeau government desperately seeks to improve its polling numbers heading into an election next year, Canadians are increasingly confronted with the reality that many of its signature policies don’t make sense. Not only that but, even worse, they often work against each other. A case in point is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s simultaneous goals of significantly increasing Canada’s annual immigration levels, creating more affordable housing and lowering Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by 2020. The problem is that higher immigration lowers the availability and raises the cost of housing, as well as increasing greenhouse gases. When the Trudeau government came to power in 2015, 271,845 immigrants became permanent residents of Canada. Its current plan boosts that number to 465,000 this year, 485,000 in 2024, 500,000 in 2025 and “stabilizes” it at 500,000 in 2026. In 2022, while the Trudeau government was developing its plans, its own public service warned it that this would exacerbate Canada’s housing shortage, raise prices and adversely affect other government services. As the Canadian Press reported earlier this year, documents obtained through an access-to-information request revealed that in 2022, public servants in the immigration ministry warned the government that, “In Canada, population growth has exceeded the growth in available housing units ... As the federal authority charged with managing immigration ... policy-makers must understand the misalignment between population growth and housing supply, and how permanent and temporary immigration shapes population growth ... “Rapid increases put pressure on health care and affordable housing.” Then there’s the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Herbert Grubel, a former federal MP and emeritus professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and Patrick Grady, a former senior official in the federal finance department, estimated in a 2021 Financial Post article that based on higher immigration levels, “greenhouse gas emissions will be 7.5% above what they would have been otherwise” in 2030 and “this gap will be much larger by 2050, the year the government has promised to reduce emissions to net-zero as required by the Paris accord.” As Canadians for a Sustainable Society notes on its website, “there is a direct link between immigration and sustainability.” One would think this would be obvious to everyone, including the Trudeau Liberals. Apparently not.",

        "content": "Australia is providing a $2.5 million aid package as Papua New Guinea (PNG) faces the aftermath of a massive landslide that buried over 2,000 villagers in Enga Province. A catastrophic landslide in a remote region of PNG has resulted in and posed substantial challenges for rescue and recovery efforts. The international community, including Australia and the United Nations, is stepping in to offer assistance. \"As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support,\" said Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. The treacherous terrain and ongoing geological instability, including falling rocks and cracking soil, are severely hampering rescue efforts. Australia's aid will include technical experts, incident management assistance, geo-hazard assessments, and early recovery support, with the Australian Defence Force involved. Australia may consider additional support beyond the initial aid package as the situation develops. Rescue operations will continue in the challenging conditions, with hopes of finding more survivors diminishing as time passes. Share 1 min read",

        "content": "An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government's proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada's non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada's conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government's draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government's draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 per cent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) blasted an that killed at least 45 people over the weekend as “an indefensible atrocity,” as criticism rises of the Israeli military operation in the southern Gaza city. The Israeli strike on the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah targeted a humanitarian zone filled with tents, where Israel’s military previously instructed displaced Palestinians to shelter from the ongoing war against militant group Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The Israeli military claimed the strike killed two senior Hamas leaders. “The IDF’s attack on a tent camp of innocents in Rafah is an indefensible atrocity,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote . “This was done in open defiance of President Biden’s red line and the ICJ’s call for a ceasefire.” She added that it is “long past due” for Biden to “live up to his word” and stop military aid shipments to Israel, following through on a in an attempt to prevent Israeli attacks on Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a and called for an investigation into the civilian deaths Monday. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion, because this is our policy.” The attack comes just days after the International Court of Justice its operations in Rafah, the last remaining major settlement in Gaza that has not been invaded by the Israeli military. The strike was widely denounced, as criticism rises on the Israeli military operation in Rafah. A White House National Security Council spokesperson that the attack was “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas... but as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” the spokesperson said. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened.” French President Emmanuel Macron used the strike as an opportunity to again call for a cease-fire in the conflict. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” Macron wrote in a post on X. “I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.” The Israeli military has , despite strong warnings from the Biden administration. More than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people are believed to be sheltering in Rafah, and more than 80 percent of the territory’s population overall are displaced from their homes. The U.N. said famine has begun in parts of the region as civilians struggle to get access to humanitarian aid.",

Several days ago, Las Vegas Aces head coach Becky Hammon imported the media to \"back off\" any notion that WNBA veterans dislike Caitlin Clark . \"We love Caitlin Clark. I think she’s amazing. I watch every time I possibly could. Our league loves her,\" Hammon began . She then took a swipe at a race narrative — her own star player in A'ja Wilson said that race was a \"huge thing\" in Clark's popularity.

(AP Photo/John Loche, Filer) \"Even the Black and White thing — knock it off. It's not there. It's not there. So shut down the noise, and Black and White, what is she, 22? She's a 22-year-old woman with a lot of pressure. She's not perfect. She's a rookie in this league. Back off,\" Hammon said. Many took that as a swipe at Wilson, who had actually been standing right next to Hammon during that plea. Hammon was asked about those comments, with a reporter saying it had been \"miscontrued a couple times.\" \"It's construed as some of our minority Black and brown women are hating on her because she's white, and that is not the case. Let's take Caitlin out of the picture. What I think is upsetting... It's not about Caitlin. Give her her flowers. She's done stuff that no man or woman, Black or White, has ever done in college basketball. Give that woman her flowers,\" Hammon said . \"But what it does is, it has highlighted how Black and brown greatness has not been celebrated or valued as much. That's what I was talking about.\" Those recent comments did seem to echo what Wilson said earlier this month.

It doesn’t matter what we all do as Black women, we’re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That’s why it boils my blood when people say it’s not about race because it is.\" Ahead of her game Friday, Clark was asked about the \"narratives around the attention\" she's gotten \"versus some of the vets that have been in this league for a long time.\" \"To be honest, I'm not really on social media. I don't read that,\" Clark said. \"This is my job. My job is to compete and play basketball every single day. I think the more attention we can get on every team around this league, that's only going to help me get better and better. \"My job is just to continue to show up and help this team get better.

        "content": "Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff’s two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe’s two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach's blast.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Joe Ryan pitched seven smooth innings for the Minnesota Twins, who got a two-run homer by Jose Miranda and a three-run shot from Trevor Larnach and hung on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff’s two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe’s two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach’s blast. The Royals have their first losing streak since a two-game skid from May 4-5 and just their second since April 30. Their eight-game winning streak was stopped on Sunday in Tampa Bay . TRAINER’S ROOM Royals CF Kyle Isbel was cleared for action after a full pregame workout but remained on the bench as a precaution, two days after fouling a ball off his face that caused a small fracture in his upper nose.

        "content": "A HEALTH Maintenance Organisation, AVON Healthcare Limited, has reinforced its commitment to promoting healthy living by donating sanitary products to 500 underprivileged schoolgirls in Lagos in honour of World Menstrual Hygiene Day, celebrated globally today. This initiative was part of a community outreach programme held at Bright Achiever’s School in Bariga, Lagos, and also marked the end of their #PurpleLipsChallenge, a campaign celebrating women and raising awareness about menstrual hygiene. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Avon HMO, Adesimbo Ukiri, while highlighting the significance of the initiative, cited economic challenges and rising costs that make essential goods inaccessible for many Nigerians. She said: “The inability to afford personal hygiene products can significantly hinder a girl’s education and overall well-being, affecting their long-term development and potential to make meaningful contributions to the society. Through this initiative, we aim to ensure that girls can remain in school throughout the academic year, helping to create a future where women and men can equally contribute to the society. “By fostering partnership between the private sector and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), more girls can stay in school year-round, attaining the same educational opportunities as boys. Empowered girls become empowered women, and when both women and men have the necessary tools, they can actively contribute to building a more inclusive and thriving society. Launched in 2019, the #PurpleLipsChallenge encouraged women to share photos of themselves wearing purple lipstick on social media. For every photo posted, Avon HMO pledged to provide a schoolgirl with reusable sanitary products. This year’s campaign, like the one in 2019, gained local and international support, attracting participants from Nigeria, London, Texas, Abu Dhabi & Ontario. A key driver of this success was Avon HMO’s collaboration with Safety for Every Girl, an NGO focused on eradicating period poverty and advancing menstrual equity in Nigeria. Additionally, leading organizations such as Heirs Energies, United Capital Plc., Afriland Properties, and Avon Medical Practice lent their support. Beyond providing sanitary kits, Avon HMO empowered the girls by providing education on managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. This was done through health talks and practical demonstrations where they showed the girls how to properly use the sanitary kits. Period poverty remains a substantial barrier to education for many girls in Nigeria. According to UNESCO, one in ten girls in Sub-Saharan Africa misses school during their menstrual cycle, potentially losing up to 20% of the school year. This interruption not only hampers their academic progress but also limits their future prospects. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario — Federal anti-scab legislation passed 3rd reading today, clearing its final hurdle in the House of Commons, and significantly levelling the playing field for workers’ rights in federally-regulated sectors like communications and transportation. “This is a long-awaited victory for workers’ bargaining rights in Canada,” said CUPE’s National President Mark Hancock. “And let’s not forget, this is what happens when the NDP – backed by the labour movement – put the rights of workers front and centre in the House of Commons. Let’s also not forget that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has voted against anti-scab legislation not once, not twice, but eight times in the past. The Conservatives only voted for it this time because they knew better than to pick a fight with the labour movement as we approach the next election.” Currently, employers are able to hire scabs in order to break the morale and bank accounts of striking and locked out workers, as is the case with members of CUPE 2614 at the Port of Quebec, who have been locked out and replaced with scabs since September 2022. Employers also use scab labour to ship jobs out of the country, as is the case with members of CUPE 2815 who have been locked out from their jobs at Videotron in Gatineau, Quebec since October 2023. While these workers have gone seven months without a paycheque, Videotron is able to continue business as usual, while paying bottom-dollar to ship jobs out of the country. Anti-scab legislation will make all of this illegal. Employers will no longer be allowed to hire replacement workers (scabs) during strikes and lockouts, thereby balancing the scales and giving more power back to workers to fight for better wages and a better life. “Today we have climbed another rung on the ladder toward justice and fairness for workers,” said CUPE’s National Secretary-Treasurer Candace Rennick. “This marks an extraordinary milestone in the fight for workers’ rights in Canada, and a profound testament to the power of workers when we organize and join with our allies in Parliament to fight for what is right. We never gave up on the fight for anti-scab legislation for federally-regulated industries, and we won’t stop until it’s in effect in all jurisdictions across Canada.” Anti-scab legislation has already been shown to reduce the length and frequency of strikes and lockouts in Quebec and British Columbia where anti-scab laws are already in effect provincially. The Kinew NDP government in Manitoba has also promised anti-scab legislation. The federal legislation must now be confirmed by the Senate before receiving Royal Assent.

        "content": "After causing multiple rainouts earlier this season, Mother Nature made up for it this weekend at Oxford Plains Speedway. The track hosted two days of racing to make up for past postponements. Regular Saturday-night Oxford Championship Series competition took place at its scheduled time, and then all the divisions were in action Sunday. Austin Teras captured the first 50-lap Super Late Model feature of the weekend. The part-time competitor who won multiple times at the track last year returned to victory lane, with a pair of early-season points championship contenders in Scott McDaniel and Steven Chicoine joining him on the podium. Other winners Saturday included: Jordan Russell (Limiteds and Street Stocks), Adam Stearns (Mad Bombers), Alex Mowatt (Thunder Stocks) and Jaxson Moreside (Rookies). The Wicked Good Vintage Racing Association visited Saturday night, with Matt Gosley winning the Outlaws feature and Dave Foster topping the field in the Hobby division. Brandon Varney turned his fortunes around Sunday. The SLM rookie placed 21st out of 24 starters Saturday, but at the end of Sunday’s 50-lap feature, the Auburn native captured his first win of the season and second of his career . Both have come while wheeling the car normally driven by Varney’s car owner, Dennis Spencer Jr. Dominic Curit was Sunday’s runner-up, and Calvin Rose Jr. rounded out the podium. Teras finished fifth in the 19-car field. Jordan Russell made it a weekend sweep in the Limiteds division. He settled for a fifth-place finish in Sunday’s Street Stocks feature, which was won by Billy Childs Jr., who was runner-up to Russell on Saturday. Brandon Johnson , who placed third in Saturday’s feature, slotted behind Childs in second Sunday. Among Sunday’s other winners were: Corey Morgan (Mad Bombers), Thomas Richards (Thunder Stocks), Liz Newton (Rookies), Adam Oneil (Rebels) and Matt Morneau (Cruisers). The track also hosted a 50-lap enduro, with Zach Audet conquering the 32-car field. WISCASSET WINNERS Mike Hopkins won his second straight Coastal 200 at Wiscasset Speedway on Sunday. That was the spotlight race of a slate that also included three other feature races. Adam Chadbourne added to his career trophy haul at the track by winning the Coastal Mod 50 Modifieds race, Jase Mongeon won the 25-lap Bob Weymouth Memorial race for the visiting NELCAR legends car series, and Dan McKeage Jr. captured the checkered flag for the 35-lap Strictly Streets division feature.

        "content": "A six-month battle to evict boats moored at Mosquito Creek Marina has left the boatyard a ghost town, with those few who remain fighting for a sense of community. In the weeks before Christmas, Nch’ḵay̓ Development Corporation, run by the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), announced it would be closing a number of its docks at its North Vancouver marina for repairs. The 500 boats and 38 boat sheds moored would have to vacate the marina by May 31. Those deemed residents – moorage customers of live-aboard boat sheds and live-aboard boats – have since been offered an extension, but will have to vacate at a later date, no earlier than September of 2025. The owners of the 65 floathouses at the marina are not facing eviction and will continue to receive the same 12-month moorage licence extensions they are accustomed to receiving, according to an update on the Nch’ḵay̓ website. Scott Burwood, one of a large number of ex-Mosquito Creek Marina tenants to have relocated to Point Roberts in the United States, considers himself “one of the lucky ones.” “There are about 50 of us who have moved to Point Roberts, and we’re grateful we managed to secure that, but there are still a lot of people in real trouble,” he said. “This is not just wealthy people’s boats that are down there, it’s a real community, an incredible community, and it’s sad that that would be discarded.” The promise of an extended stay offers small consolation to the live-aboards and floathouse owners that are adapting to living in a floating neighbourhood with far fewer neighbours, said floathouse owner of eight years Ginger Gosnell-Myers. “It is really empty right now, so many people have up and left,\" she said. With around 130 boats left remaining, and just 17 boat sheds, more than half of the marina’s boating population has already moved on, said Gary Muuren, executive vice president of operations at Nch’ḵay̓. Muuren said Nch’ḵay̓ had tried to assist boaters in any way it could, extending eviction dates where possible and making it a “real necessity” to aid boaters in finding a new home. “We reached out to approximately 100-plus marinas and they were all wonderful. There were people in Nanaimo, in Duncan, in Salt Spring Island that reached out ... it’s a whole community with wonderful people,” he said. Addressing the speculation among boaters that penned development is the reason for the mass eviction, Muuren said there is nothing at play other than a necessity to improve the safety of the marina. “We have not taken any steps in determining what the future would be,” he said. “This was driven by safety concerns, there are no other plans for [the marina] at the moment. It’s going to take time, at least a year, before we know what’s going to happen going forward.” An update to the Nch’ḵay̓ website states anyone who has not removed their property by May 31 will be mooring in an unlicensed slip, and Mosquito Creek Marina will \"deal with the vessels\" at the owners’ expense.",

        "description": "In competing globally with the U.S. for economic opportunity, rather than friend or competitor, Canada has often been roadkill",
        "content": "Countries may be friendly in engaging each other, but they are not friends. They are allies and competitors. And in competing globally with the United States for economic opportunity, Canada has often been roadkill. This need be front of mind as Canada again prepares a concerted effort to engage the U.S. after its November election and in advance of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review in two years. This roadkill reality has been a constant theme in Canada-U.S. relations from at least the 1950s, when the U.S. punished Canada for breaking its grain embargo of China during that country’s greatest famine, to the recent U.S. use of the NAFTA renegotiation (which produced the USMCA) to gain advantage over Canada in agriculture sales to China. In these and other cases, including U.S. enforcement of its embargo of Cuba, what starts as a measure to promote legitimate U.S. security concerns – advertently or inadvertently, and often with great hypocrisy – morphs into measures that benefit U.S. businesses and harm their competitors. This reality is set to worsen as the U.S. increases the scope, intensity and extraterritoriality of security measures it employs in its conflict with China. For example, it is already foreshadowed in U.S. hints that Canada’s slow compliance with seizing (what the U.S. claims are) forced-labour goods from China – as mandated under the USMCA – will be on the table in the coming review. In this hypersecurity environment, the warm, fuzzy romanticism of a friendship needs to be replaced by sober, clear-headed thinking as part of an overall retooling of how Canada engages the U.S. It is also necessary to draw lessons from how Canada has historically managed the tension between trade and security interests with the U.S. Between the mid-1950s and the early 60s, a low point in modern Canada-U.S. relations, Canada was losing global wheat sales through the U.S. use of political coercion abroad and subsidies disguised as foreign aid. This caused farm incomes on the Prairies to fall drastically, precipitating a crisis. Ottawa’s entreaties to Washington were ignored. Around this time, Canada gained entry into the Chinese wheat market, where the Americans were absent owing to an embargo on China, ostensibly for security reasons. Canadian grain sales grew; Washington was furious. Rather than discuss a more equitable sharing of global grain markets, the Kennedy administration had U.S.-based oil companies refuse to fuel grain ships at the Port of Vancouver and threatened Canada’s auto industry. At one point, the Americans suggested that they grant licences for Canada to violate the embargo, essentially to approve which Canadian products Canada could ship from Canadian ports and to whom. Most recently, during renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement, the Americans, at the last minute, inserted a clause to deter negotiating a trade agreement with China, again ostensibly for security reasons. This clause, which allowed a country to leave the agreement if another negotiated a deal with China, had no new legal or material effect. The right to leave for any reason existed in previous treaty versions. It did, however, have a psychological impact, essentially scaring the Canadian public, private sector, media and politicians. But while Canada panicked, the Americans negotiated and then signed their own partial trade agreement with China, which gave specific, unique advantage to American agricultural exporters at the expense of Canadian counterparts. We’ve been to this rodeo too often not to know that the Americans use legitimate security concerns – such as the Cold War, containing Cuba and, more recently, countering China’s rise – to also realize commercial advantage. We have been and will continue to be good allies with the Americans on security issues. We need to learn to be better competitors, which we can do without hostility, aggression or a “beaver warrior” (a Canadian version of China’s “wolf warrior”) approach to economic diplomacy. We did so in the past. Whether Canada can rediscover that clarity in an era of greater economic, psychological and security dependence on the U.S. is an open question to be answered at the review of the USMCA two years hence.",

        "description": "Alex de Minaur has been talking confidently about enjoying his best run at Roland Garros - but a youthful American in Paris stands in his way.",
        "content": "It seems only yesterday the eternally fresh-faced Alex de Minaur was one of the much-touted NextGen hotshots, but now it's a new breed of teen tennis guns who are on his trail. \"He's a tall American, dangerous and with powerful groundstrokes,\" is de Minaur's verdict on his latest young hitman at the French Open, 19-year-old Alex Michelsen, who's already shot down the Australian No.1 once this season on a Mexican hard court. De Minaur is counting on the stocky, 1.93m Californian being a bit greener on the red clay but can't rely on it, with Michelsen, who's up to No.60 and will surely soon join his seven compatriots in the top 50, having downed fellow American world No.12 Taylor Fritz in Geneva last week. \"It should be a tough battle, and hopefully I can get my revenge,\" added de Minaur. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Australian tennis is counting on it, a mite desperate for its main man to prevail after a wretched start to the tournament with five players already out, one withdrawn though injury and not a winner on the board. De Minaur has got used to the responsibility of being the spearhead, and isn't talking down his expectations any more. At a mature 25 and having tasted life in the top 10 this year, he feels a quarter-final place, at least, in every slam should be achievable for him now. On clay, the world No.11 is adamant he's become a different player this year. \"I'm yet to go past the second round here in Paris, so that definitely has to be the first step, but I don't see why I can't play well,\" he told AAP. \"Adapting to clay has been a learning process. A lot of my improvement has probably had to do with me growing into my body a little bit more, getting a little bit stronger. \"My groundstrokes aren't probably as effective on the clay as they would be on other surfaces, so I've got to make sure that I'm nice and strong and physical with it. \"Getting that strength and power to help me out on the clay has been very important and, also understanding the type of tennis that I want to play on the surface and using a little bit more creativity, movement, speed to create more variety. \"It's all clicked together and I've gained a lot of confidence on the surface. And, mentally too, I've told myself that there's no reason why I can't play well on this surface.\" Should calamity befall de Minaur, there's at least one bit of good news on the horizon with one Aussie guaranteed for the second round from the Alexei Popyrin-Thanasi Kokkinakis clash. The shame, as their colleague Max Purcell noted, is that they're both playing well enough to have both gone on a good run. \"I'll be watching though,\" smiled Purcell. \"It's a popcorn match, definitely.\" \"He's one of my better mates on tour,\" says Kokkinakis, revealing that he and Popyrin had decided radio silence between each other might be the best bet before their clash. \"We practise a lot together. It is tricky - but it should be a fun one.\" AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION ON DAY THREE OF THE FRENCH OPEN (PREFIX DENOTES SEEDING): Men's singles Alexei Popyrin v Thanasi Kokkinakis 11-Alex de Minaur v Alex Michelsen (USA) Adam Walton v Arthur Rinderknech (FRA) Rinky Hijikata v Luciano Darderi (ITA)",

        "description": "Walton supported the 'Conference of Champions' like nobody else during his career as a broadcaster for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network.",
        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. Walton loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday , first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them. It was the only conference that the champion of the ‘Conference of Champions’ ever knew. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter/X: @ WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.

        "description": "Walton supported the 'Conference of Champions' like nobody else during his career as a broadcaster for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network.",
        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. Walton loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday , first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them. It was the only conference that the champion of the ‘Conference of Champions’ ever knew. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter/X: @ WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.

        "description": "Hearing takes place Friday for Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer",
        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. RELATED: Two Abbotsford hog-farm protesters sentenced to 30 days in jail In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. RELATED: Guilty verdicts stand for 2 Abbotsford hog-farm protesters",

        "content": "Photo: Health Canada The B.C.-based vodka seltzer manufacturer, N?TRL, distributed 33,000 tumblers with sulfuric and phosphoric acids trapped between the cups' walls. At least 43 Canadians have fallen ill after tumblers branded by the B.C.-based vodka-drink manufacturer NÜTRL began leaking sulfuric and phosphoric acids trapped between the cups’ walls. Health Canada issued a recall of the product last week after 33,000 tumblers were distributed to customers as a promotional gift alongside 12- or 15-packs of NÜTRL seltzers between April 29 and May 17, 2024. “This solution may release when the tumbler is filled with liquid, posing a potential risk of serious injury,” said Health Canada in its recall. By May 23, dozens of people had fallen ill with reports of headaches, nausea, cramping and abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Health Canada also warned that affected people may experience burning of the lips, tongue, throat, stomach, and other tissue damage. NÜTRL, which opened its distillery in Delta, B.C., in 2013, said in a statement posted to its website that the recall began after the Chinese manufacturer, Suncope, contacted Health Canada warning of a defect. The statement said the substance inside the walls of the tumblers is a chemical cleaning solution that may result in elevated levels of iron, chromium and nickel. “Consumer safety is our top priority,” the statement reads. For more information, Health Canada advises consumers can call 1-866-846-1778 or email [email protected] . People experiencing any symptoms related to the recall should seek medical attention.",

The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m.",

I couldn’t believe I was in a fifth set.” Harriet Dart loses out to Linda Nosková in a tight 1st round match #BackTheBrits 🇬🇧 | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/WZkj62Yuqr — LTA (@the_LTA) May 27, 2024 Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Dart said: “I felt I played an OK match to be honest, I always knew it would be a tough match. I’m just disappointed I didn’t capitalise on some of my opportunities.” Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

Ali Taha Koc Thank you, Ozlem. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. At Turkcell, we are celebrating our 30th anniversary with great pride, having pioneered numerous milestones from our first call to becoming Turkey's leading technology provider. In the first quarter of 2024, we are delighted to share our successful results. By taking timely actions, we have delivered double-digit Real Growth despite global central banks tightening policies and reaccelerating inflation in Turkey. Our top line grew 12% to TRY31 billion with a remarkable 23% increase in EBITDA. These results have been driven by a rational price increases since 2021, which enabled mobile ARPU growth to reach 17% and fiber residential ARPU growth to reach 14%. Supported by lower energy and interconnection expenses, operating leverage expanded the EBITDA margin by 3.8 percentage points to 41.4%. Additionally, our commitment to focusing on value generating post-paid and fiber customer acquisition resulted in 333,000 net additions in the first quarter of the year. Overall, our strong operational performance resulted in a remarkable net profit of TRY2.6 billion. Our strong first quarter performance enabled us to revise our 2024 revenue growth upwards, which I will elaborate on later. Next slide, please. Let's take a look at our operational performance in the first quarter. Unlike previous quarters, competition in the mobile market was relatively less aggressive in this quarter. On the mobile front, we sustained our focus on the postpaid segment, which contributes more value to our financials, resulting in a net increase of 472,000 subscribers. Over the past 12-months, our postpaid base has grown with 1.7 million additions. Our postpaid customer base exceeded 27.6 million, reflecting 72% of the total on a three-point rise year-over-year. Disconnections from previous year's tourist lines, rising new acquisition price levels, and demand to alternative data solutions were the main factors behind the prepaid net loss of 243,000 subscribers. Our customer-centric and innovative approach contributed to a low churn rate this quarter. The churn rate in the mobile segment was at 1.5%, marking the lowest rate in the past six years. Driven by sequential price adjustments, upsell efforts, and an increased share of post-paid subscribers in the portfolio, blended mobile ARPU rose by 95% year-on-year and continued to outpace CPI. The base effect from the last year's earthquake contributed to the widening ARPU inflation gap in this quarter. Taking into account inflation adjustments, mobile ARPU recorded 17% yearly growth. Next slide, please, Ozlem. In the fixed broadband market, this year started with price adjustment in December, and the market has become more rational compared to the previous year. In the first quarter, we had 48,000 fiber customer additions to our portfolio, following focused investments in expanding our fiber footprint over past years. We are pleased to have added 41,000 IPTV subscribers, reaching the homes of 1.5 million customers. TV plus is a premier solution for fiber subscriber retention, enabling us to implement effective price adjustments, thanks to its rich content. With the contributions of TV plus, our pure fiber technology and a rational market, we achieved a fixed churn rate of 1.3%, marking the lowest level since 2007. Widening the gap with CPI, residential fiber ARPU growth continued to rise, achieving a 90% year-on-year growth on a historical basis. Our upsells are forced to higher speed packages and an increase in 12-month contract share within the customer portfolio were the main components of this outstanding performance. Similar to the mobile site, the base effect from last year's [Indiscernible] contributed to the widening ARPU inflation gap in this quarter. Lastly, we will be prioritizing fiber subscriber net additions over increasing home passes this year. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate lower new compass figures, compared to last year. Next slide. Let's discuss our strategic focus areas, starting with digital services and solutions. Standalone revenue from our digital services and solutions grew an impressive 32% year-on-year, primarily driven by a 29% revenue increase in digital OTT services, which has a 5.5 million paid user base. Among these offerings our TV services and personal cloud service were particularly instrumental. TV plus’ success is remarkable. As it has been the only platform consistently growing its market share since 2014. According to the ICTA report, the TV plus market share increased to 17.6%, cementing its second position as of ‘23 year-end. In the first quarter, digital business services generated TRY2.8 billion in revenue and secured more than 1,200 contracts. We remain committed to maintain our leading position in the data center market. Combined with our cloud services, revenues from those grew by 48% to TRY470 million. Next slide. Paycell, our innovative payment service platform, registered a remarkable quarter delivering 33% year-on-year growth. Rising interest rates and commission on post solutions as well as volume growth supported the top line. The 57% surge in Pay Later volume was positively affected by a 16% increase in the number of active users. Paycell EBITDA rose 47% year-on-year. The primary factor behind the rise in the margin is post-expense growth lagging behind its revenue increase. Financing customers' technological needs, finance sales revenues rose 53% on a surging loan portfolio, higher average interest rate and the contribution of insurance business revenues. The higher cost of funding stemming from tight monetary policies secures finance sales profitability similar to the banking sector. This was reflected in the next -- in the net interest margin, which narrowed by 2.4% point this quarter. Since financial issues loans with relatively shorter maturities, we expect this pressure to decline in the second-half of the year. Meanwhile, our cost of risk is at 1.7%, which is lower than first quarter of 2023. Next slide. Lastly, our performance in the international markets. Turkcell’s international revenues, which account for 3% of group revenues, rose 2.2% to TRY815 million. Best revenues rose 24% on a yearly basis in local currency terms, primarily driven by higher data, SMS and service revenues. The 3.2% point improvement in EBITDA margin was sustained by dedicated cost management. Next slide. I would like to end by sharing our revision for 2024 guidance. Given our first quarter performance, we revise our 2024 revenue growth guidance to low-double-digit growth. For EBITDA margin and CapEx intensity, we maintain our guidance. I will now leave the floor to our CFO, Mr. Kamil Kalyon. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much, Ali Taha. Now let's move on to our financial results. Our consolidated revenue increased by 11.8% on a yearly basis to TRY30.8 billion. The Turkcell Turkey segment was the biggest supporter of the Group topline growth with a 13% rise on a year-on-year basis. This was driven mainly by an expanding subscriber base, particularly on the postpaid side, and strong ARPU growth, thanks to sequential price adjustments with successful upselling efforts. The Techfin segment contributed TRY460 million to the top line with the strong performances of Paycell and Financell, which grew 33% and 54% respectively. Next slide, please. In the first quarter of 2024, EBITDA rose 23% on a yearly basis to TRY12.8 billion, thanks to strong revenue growth. The EBITDA margin expanded 3.8 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the increase in personal expenses due to the [Indiscernible] annual wage rise and the increased funding cost of our financing operation, the Group EBITDA margin benefited from a decline in the cost of goods sold, energy expenses, and interconnection expenses as a percentage of revenue. After the electricity prices increase in 2023, which was relatively low compared to inflation and our corresponding price adjustments in line with the inflation, the proportion of energy expenses to our revenue decreased, thereby supporting the EBITDA margin. Additionally, the continued decline in MTR positively impacted our profitability. A trend expected to persist throughout 2024. Next slide, please. Now let's dive into the net income performance. Thanks to a robust operational performance, EBITDA has contributed TRY2.4 billion to net income. The net FX loss item has pressured net profit by TRY1.8 billion, due to higher foreign exchange rate change, which is partially offset by mark-to-market of financial derivatives. By the first quarter, the increased weight of non-monetary assets on the balance sheet, the dividend distribution, which decreased retained earnings, and higher inflation indexation resulted in a positive impact of TRY3.1 billion on net profit, marked under the monetary gain and loss item. Despite the positive impact of indexation between statutory reporting and IFRS, deferred tax decreased, compared to the previous period. Lower corporate tax also supported the net profit. Next slide, please. Let's take a closer look at our CapEx management. The CapEx to sales ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was 18.2% with accelerated revenue. As we plan to accelerate our data center and renewable energy investments in the upcoming quarters and given the seasonality of the second-half, we expect to reach 23% CapEx intensity for 2024. In this quarter, we primarily focused our investments on mobile and fixed assets. Fixed-site investments are primarily driven by tower fiberization. We remain committed to achieving our fiberization target of 41% within this year. The share of data center investments within the total investments for this quarter appears small. Yet, we expect this proportion to increase over the coming quarters in line with our target of installing an additional 9.1 megawatt capacity. Thanks to the modular structure of our data centers, we simply add new modules as demand arises. Next slide, please. Now let's turn our attention to the balance sheet. In Q1 2024, our cash position is at TRY49 billion. Note that a total of TRY5.2 billion wireless usage tax payments, the second installment of the earthquake donation, and employee bonuses had a negative effect on our cash position. Additionally, we have invested in euro bonds for effective cash management. Our gross debt was at TRY98 billion, and we ended this quarter with a net debt position of TRY33 billion. Due to the decreasing cash position, our net leverage slightly increased to 0.6 times. This year, our FX debt service is around $340 million, which we consider quite manageable given our strong cash position. We possess an adequate cash reserve to fulfill the 10-year euro bond redemption in 2025 and are exploring a range of funding alternatives for the reissues. The majority of our cash remains denominated in hard currencies, excluding FX swaps, 49% of our cash is in U.S. dollars and 24% in euros. Next slide, please. Lastly, let's look into the management of foreign currency risk. In the first quarter of this year, our balance sheet had around $2 billion equivalent in FX financial liabilities. In addition to the $1.6 billion equivalent FX denominated financial assets, we have a $700 million effective hedging portfolio, the vast majority of which consists of futures, forward and NDFs. Since we believe the Turkish lira has entered a period of real appreciation and with hedging costs in the market having risen significantly over the past couple of years, we plan to reduce our derivative portfolio in the coming periods. As of this quarter, we have a net FX position of $158 million, due to our plans to reduce our derivatives portfolio, it's fair to expect our net FX position to decrease in the coming periods, while remaining with our neutral FX range of minus and plus $200 million. This concludes our presentation and we can now open the line for questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tiron Cesar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tiron Cesar Yes, hi. Good evening. Thanks for the call and for the opportunity to ask questions. I have three questions, but they're all easy. The first one, if that's okay. The first one is on the guidance increase on the revenue. What surprised you the most in the past, let's say one, two months, so you had to hike this guidance? That would be the first question. The second question, I would like to understand what exchange rate are you assuming in your budget for the lira? And let's say, if the lira depreciates less than per your budget, could it be that you spent a little bit less CapEx, so maybe the CapEx intensity will be less than your guidance? And then the third question, going back to the datacenters, can you please explain your ambition in the field and how large do you think the capacity would be in the medium term? Thank you so much. Ali Taha Koc Hi, Cesar. Thank you very much for the question. We had a quarter with solid financial and operational performance actually, which has beyond our initial plans. Accordingly, our revenue growth guidance for 2024 increased to low-double-digit growth, and there's no change in our EBITDA margin and CapEx adjusted guidance. However, given the macroeconomic dynamics, projecting inflation will be challenging, and the actual figures may vary according to the realization -- realized inflation and other factors such as the cyclicality of revenues. And also the minister of treasury and finance [Indiscernible] announced that the middle term plan OVP, is planned to be reviewed at the end of summer. Accordingly, we will be closed following the macroeconomic developments for possible further revision. But to say true that the first quarter -- first couple of months of this quarter is better than our expectations, so that's the reason that we revised our guidance. For the datacenter business, we're expecting -- we already have four big high-tech datacenters, and we are planning to build more and actually we are looking for a collaboration with big companies to bring the data, whatever it is with data we have in the Turkey, we want to keep it and we want to be a data hub for this region. So that's the reason that we have a huge ambition about the data center business. So currently we have four big data centers and we are adding more to them and then in the future you're going to see more coming from Turkcell. Kamil Kalyon For the second question, normally our year-end U.S. dollars FX rate estimation is TRY37.5 and the average rate we are assuming TRY34. We believe that we will be in line with our guidance for the full-year for the CapEx side. However, in case of a spike in the FX rate, if it realizes within the years, we can postpone our discretionary CapEx in order to create a buffer. We are chasing the developments in the economical side, but most probably the FX rate will be realized within our estimations this year. Tiron Cesar Thank you so much. That was very clear. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator The next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hello, good evening. Can you hear me? Ali Taha Koc Yes, loud and clear. Unidentified Analyst Good. Thank you very much for the presentation and congrats on the results. It's also great news about the upgraded guidance. I have two quick questions, so my first one, you mentioned that your cash position decreased because of investments in Eurobond. Could you please elaborate on that a little bit? And my second question is related to Ukraine. Obviously, we've seen some headlines in the news about potentially positive developments. But, my question would be, what will you do with the process from this asset sale? Will you do you plan to pay additional dividends or do you plan to use that for CapEx or maybe for your Eurobond repayment? That's it. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much. I will give the answer for the first one. The duration of the euro bond is five years. Turkish Sovereign and Bank, when we look at the, for example, yields in the Eurobonds, there's a high yield when we compare it with the deposit rates. Therefore, we prefer to invest Eurobonds in order to benefit from the high yields. For the second question maybe you can give. Ali Taha Koc As you may know in April the seizure of our -- on our Ukrainian assets lifted. It's a positive news. We are now waiting the necessary permission from our anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine. So this is the last step for the conclusion -- concluding of this deal. Although we do not have a board decision regarding the proceeds we will obtain from the sale of our assets in Ukraine, we have important investment projections in the coming period, such as data centers, solar energy and as well as the 5.5G auctions. So we will we are looking for huge investments projections in the coming period. Unidentified Analyst Got you. Thank you. So, do you still see the deal closing during this year? Ali Taha Koc Yes, definitely. Because there are two big roadblocks, one is just this seizure and another one is the anti-monopoly committee. Other than that, everything is clear. So hopefully, after this permission from the anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine finalized, hopefully near future and we are talking about in the period of months, we're expecting that's going to be done in this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Ignebekçili Murat with HSBC. Please go ahead. Ignebekçili Murat Hello. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Can you clarify the calculation of net debt? I think you have changed something over there, because I see that the FX deposit accounts are no longer included in the net cash calculation. Am I missing something here? Kamil Kalyon Murat, we do not have any change in our net debt position calculation of net debt position. We are using the same method. Ignebekçili Murat Net cash still the total cash is at TRY48.8 billion, and when we get to the... Kamil Kalyon Some portion of cash is categorized in the financial assets. Maybe it might. Ignebekçili Murat Yes, yes, exactly. So why don't you include those in the cash calculation? Kamil Kalyon We included. Normally we have TRY49.5 billion in our hand and TRY15.1 financial assets. And for example, when you look at our leverage 0.58, these two amounts are included into this calculation. Ignebekçili Murat Okay, when I look at the footnote, so I see 40 almost TRY49 billion as cash and also TRY10 billion as financial assets separately. That's why I... Kamil Kalyon [Technical Difficulty] roughly. Ignebekçili Murat TRY15? Kamil Kalyon Fifteen, yes. Ignebekçili Murat Okay, we can follow-up on this later. Kamil Kalyon Okay. Ignebekçili Murat And were there any working capital issues in the first quarter? Because there's around almost TRY12.5 billion EBITDA, around TRY7.5 billion CapEx in the quarter. Kamil Kalyon Yeah, Murat. Ignebekçili Murat So -- and the change in net debt and the net debt increased TRY6 million or TRY7 million. So I think there should be some negative impact from working capital, right? Or is it tax payments or anything like that? Can you clarify that, please? Kamil Kalyon Normally, we hit around TRY9.9 billion cash outflow in this quarter related to working capital side. This was mainly driven by the as you know, we are -- we paid the second installment of the earthquake donation, in January. Additionally, we paid personal bonus payments in February. And in February, again, we paid a huge amount of wireless fee tax payments as we have some payments to our suppliers and decreased trade payments in Q1 ‘24 compared to the first quarter of the last year. We are closely following our net working capital side and I think we will recover especially collection of the wireless fee tax payment from our clients, our net working capital structure will be better in the coming periods. Ignebekçili Murat Okay. Thank you very much. And finally, when you look at the financial expenses during the quarter of very limited FX activity or limited FX depreciation? We have financial expense as I see around more than TRY5 billion of FX losses. Could you elaborate on that, please? Kamil Kalyon Yes. Normally, as you said, I think around 6% or 7% depreciation in the FX rate realized in Q1. But as you know, along with the sequential rate hikes from the CBT side short-term rates and hedging costs increased very significantly. Therefore, this was the main driver behind the increase of our FX loss and the financial expenses. In addition to the credit rates are also increased very much before the election side, you remember. Therefore, these three effects affected our FX position or FX loss side negatively. Ignebekçili Murat So is it safe to assume that given that the interest rates in the market have already settled at some level, albeit very high, we should not see further significant FX losses in the coming months? The price is only the market-to-market? Kamil Kalyon Yes. As mentioned in my speech, our expectation in the FX side, we are not expecting a very high increases in the FX side. Therefore, most probably in order to decrease our hedging costs, we would like to make it short position might be in the coming periods in order to reduce our financial costs, because our estimation regarding the FX rates I think it will go for a short or mid-term side. We are not expecting any FX increases in this year. Therefore, most probably we will be opening a short position in our net FX position. Ignebekçili Murat Thank you. That's very clear. And finally, about the operation. When you look at a typical postpaid client, it is to renew this contract? What is the, like, front book, like-for-like, growth in the invoice if one is to renew this contract, compared to last year. So a new contract renewal price is up how much on a year-on-year basis? Kamil Kalyon Normally, as we said, our revenues grew by around 13% in [Indiscernible] site, the first site. And we have a very how can I say, our ARPU rates are increasing very well when we compare it to the last period, it's around 17% we have ARPU rate hike? And when we look at, for example, starting from the 2025, we had -- we made a lot of price increases and more than a 100% increase in prices within the last 20 months. We can easily say that, because we successfully implement our inflation pricing policy. Ali Taha Koc Invoice to invoice, you can talk about 100%, more than 100% invoice to invoice. Ignebekçili Murat Yes. So a typical platinum tariff is up 100% in manual terms, compared to same week last year? Kamil Kalyon Might be. Ali Taha Koc Might be. We are talking about the blended ones, but we're not talking about the markets or platinum. We're just talking about the blended. Ignebekçili Murat So yes, and the inflation rate hopefully declines in the coming quarters. In the interim, this will translate into a much larger number. I see. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator The next question comes from the line of Demirtas Cemal with Ata Invest. Please go ahead. Demirtas Cemal Thank you for the presentation and congratulations for very good results. My first question is about your strategic focus area. I see a little bit more momentum in both the Techfin Business and Digital Services revenue side? Could we expect this track to continue going forward? Because in previous years there was a little bit slower growth, but I see higher momentum. Is it sustainable? This is my first question. The second question is how do you see the consumer sentiment in your front? Do you see any changes in the consumer behavior and could you give us some color on the roaming sites? What are your expectations on that side? Thank you. And the last question is again, it has been asked about the net debt. What was the amount of wireless pretax paid in the first quarter? Thank you. Ali Taha Koc Again, let me start with the strategy focus areas. I just want to say that our momentum is going to keep on going till the end of the year and then most probably into the next year as well. So Techfin and DSS side is going to grow. And for example, Paycell saw a quarter with double-digit real growth performance, Paycell. And then also the meanwhile, finance also supported the Techfin segment growth as well in the first quarter of 2024. And also, our Digital Business Services will grow and with the digitization of the older companies, as well as the public sector. They're expecting that, that growth and the momentum is going to continue. So everybody wants to be digital and at the end of the day, Turkcell is a leading integrator and leading technology firm in Turkey. So we will be happy to digitalize and just support them in their businesses. So we're expecting especially the data center business as well as the co-op businesses is going to grow faster than we expect. So hopefully, we're going to see this momentum keep ongoing. Kamil Kalyon Demirtas, we paid TRY1.7 billion while fixed payment in February. As you know, we are paying in advance to government side and we are collecting this from our customers within the year. Demirtas Cemal Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You’re welcome. Demirtas Cemal And the consumer trends at roaming site? Ali Taha Koc So we are closely following that part as well. But, for us, what we are doing is we are just doing some new campaigns about the smart contracts. So we are just letting all the users to see if their tariff is over or not, and then we just make that, that service free of charge. So we are trying to improve our Net Promoter Score as well. So we are seeing that it is kind of easy technologically easy, especially with the electronic and eSIM, but we are closely following the trends. And then we are in order to convince people to use our eSIM or just our subscriber domain. And, so we will close the following it up, but I to say the truth that I will tell you more when we have more data, especially during this tourist season, especially the summer. We're going to see the numbers, because this is going to be the first time that we're going to see lots of tourists with electronic sin -- eSIM. So that's the reason that we're going to see the impact, both positive and negative. We have more data. I will talk more better at the end of the summer. Demirtas Cemal Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Mandaci Ece with UNLU Securities. Please go ahead. Mandaci Ece Thank you very much for the presentation and congratulations on your strong guidance. So my question is about the corporate revenues. I see [Indiscernible] I see a 3% decline in your corporate revenues. Digital business solution revenue is flat, but apart from it, I'm noticing some decline. Is this just for the first quarter? Do you expect as I can understand, you're expecting some drop over there going forward, but what was specifically the reason for this decline in the first quarter? Thank you. Ali Taha Koc So let me talk about the DBS and then the revenues growth for this quarter. Especially, our digital business services revenues remained flat in first quarter of 2024, mainly due to the fewer one-off large budget projects and hardware sales, compared to last year. And actually, additionally, revenues from public sector clients dropped from 41% Q1 of last year to 24% this quarter. And then also, it indicates reality and indicating a slowdown in public sector sales mainly due to the saving measures in the public. At this point, we're compensating for the slowdown with our value-added and recurring services and like data center and cloud businesses. So hopefully, we're just going to compensate this slowdown effect from the public sector. Kamil Kalyon Normally, we do not have any problem for the recurring service in the corporate side. As Ali Taha mentioned, we have three significant projects in the last quarter of 2023. Therefore, within the year’s most probably we do not -- we will close or we will realize real growth in the corporate side also. Mandaci Ece So margin wise, was this the reason -- one of the reasons why you had, I think a better margin maybe? Could there be a [Indiscernible] with the expected increase, could there be a margin dilution effect in the quarters ahead? Kamil Kalyon From -- are you asking from the consumer side or the from the corporate side? Mandaci Ece Corporate side, I mean. Kamil Kalyon In the corporate side from the recurring side, it's all the recurring -- the income coming from the tariffs, we do not have any dilution regarding the margin side and we are a little bit sensitive from the project perspective, because this year would be a little bit hot for the corporations and state establishments for the budget purposes. Therefore, we do not want to enter risky projects in this year. Therefore, we are selecting the more profitable and no any double receivable risk projects within this year. Therefore, we do not wait or expect a margin dilution in the corporate side also. But as you know, the terminal side or that how can I say, hardware side is a little bit less profitable issues. But we are very good at for example balancing this issue and we do not want to dilute our EBITDA margin and we are very careful about the baskets, which we how can I say prepared for this project? Mandaci Ece Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Turkcell Management for any closing comments. Thank you. Ali Taha Koc Again, thank you very much for the time and I will be happy to present you our Q1 great results. So hopefully, we're going to have the similar and then better results in the Q2. Hope to see you next time. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much. Hope to see you. Ozlem Yardim Thanks for joining. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you for calling and have a pleasant evening.",

        "content": "As keynote speaker William “Bill” Taylor offered an emotional and harrowing account of his time as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War, the true measure of sacrifice came into focus for those gathered at Historic Maplewood Cemetery for Crown Point’s Memorial Day service on Monday. Taylor, author of the book “On Full Automatic,” confessed that it was the first Memorial Day service he has attended. But has come to terms with the sacrifice he and his Marine band of brothers gave in the name of freedom. At 18 years old, Taylor enlisted in the Marines and was assigned to the First Battalion, Third Marine Regiment, Vietnam, serving nearly all of his 13-month tour during 1967 until he received his third Purple Heart medal and earned a trip home. The posting of the colors occured during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday at Historic Maplewood Cemetery. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Taylor spoke of consistent enemy engagements and fierce battles against North Vietnamese troops. He said he still speaks to the widow of his platoon leader, David Hart, who was killed in action during a landing force invasion assaulting a tree line that “felt like the Civil War days.” He recalled the loss of numerous fellow Marines during intense battles, including Operation Buffalo. “I remember we were surrounded by 200 NVA (North Vietnamese Army troops) and my best friend was killed,” said Taylor, choking back tears. “It was that day I also earned by third Purple Heart.” The American Legion Post 20 float rolls by during Crown Point’s Memorial Day parade on Monday. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Taylor’s Marine Battalion received two Presidential Unit Citations while participating in 25 combat operations. His platoon was wiped out several times, once leaving only seven out of 50 men standing. Every platoon lieutenant, sergeant and squad leader was killed, wounded or relieved of command, he said. Taylor emphasized that the scars of battle are not only physical but mental, and that while many Vietnam veterans succumbed to suicide, the suicide rate among Gulf War veterans “averages 22 a day.” As a parade through the city featuring America the Royal Regiment and Crown Point High School marching band, the crowd gathered at the cemetery for the posting of colors. American Legion Post 20 Commander Kevin Dvorak, a 10-year U.S. Navy veteran, led with opening remarks, acknowledging Gold Star families in attendance, as well as participation from American Legion Auxiliary, Sons of the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, the Polar Star Battalion of the U.S. Navy Sea Cadets and several local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops. William “Bill” Taylor (left), the keynote speaker for Crown Point’s Memorial Day ceremony, offered an emotional and harrowing account of his time as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War in a speech at Historic Maplewood Cemetery on Monday. He is pictured alongside American Legion Post 20 Commander Kevin Dvorak. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Dvorak recalled a more recent loss of American troops. “Navy SEALs Nathan Ingram and Christopher Chambers attempted to board an unflagged ship in the Arabian sea that was carrying Iranian-made weapons to Yemen last January 11,” he said. “As these two brave men were leaving their ship to climb the contraband ship, waves reportedly widened the gap between the two vessels. Chambers plunged into the water. Ingram jumped in to save him. Both were lost at sea and presumed dead.” He described Memorial Day as an occasion to honor more than 42 million men and women who died for our nation serving in wars and missions since the American Revolution. “The Global War on Terror, October 2001 to present, has resulted in nearly 1 million more deaths,” he noted. Taylor reminded that it wasn’t until the Vietnam War that the country changed its policy to bring all deceased soldiers home. “Often while the efforts to do so was gallant, it was not always possible,” he said. “Our records still include 90,000 MIAs. Others found peace at Arlington (National Cemetery) or here in Maplewood.” Dvorak recalled the death on April 1 of 102-year-old Lou Conter, the last living survivor of the USS Arizona, which sunk in the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Quoting Conter’s remarks to the American Legion, Dvorak said, “We’re not heroes. The 1,117 men who went down with the ship are the heroes. You have to remember, we got to go home, get married, have children and grandchildren, and we’ve lived a good life. Those who didn’t get to do that should be called the heroes.” Speaking on behalf of Crown Point Mayor Pete Land, who was away attending a family funeral, City Councilman Chad Jeffries, D-1st, said the service was an opportunity for the community to come together “united in respect and reverence for the heroes who had given their all.” “Today, let us also remember the families who have borne the burden of loss with grace and strength,” Jeffries said. “Their resilience is a testament to the enduring spirit of our nation. We honor their sacrifice as well, acknowledging the deep and personal cost of the freedoms we cherish.”",

        "description": "ESPNPasch told a touching story about Walton, who he spent more than a decade calling games with.",
        "content": "after a battle with cancer at the age of 71, and the . The tributes and memories fans, players, and media members shared of Walton offered a terrific example of how he had such a lasting impact on the game. From his time at UCLA to Portland to San Diego to Boston, people posted stories of Walton’s on-court prowess and anecdotes from his career. Others remembered Walton’s time calling the NBA on NBC, providing the soundtrack to the biggest games of the 90s. Many younger fans remember Walton’s most recent chapter as a broadcaster, calling college basketball games (mostly in the Pac-12) for ESPN. His partner for the majority of those games was Dave Pasch, who had an incredible chemistry with Walton, playing the straight man trying to call games while Walton wandered about, going down whatever path his mind presented to often discuss anything and everything but the game. They were a joy to watch, and on Monday, Pasch called in to to offer a remembrance of his longtime partner and share a touching anecdote about Walton, the person. \"I love you, but don't tell anybody.\" Bill Walton's longtime broadcast partner reflects on one of his favorite memories of his friend ❤️ — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) He also offered up an incredibly funny story of how they made up a bit about George Lucas creating Chewbacca in Walton’s image and then it got picked up by big entertainment outlets. Dave Pasch talks about the Chewbacca audition story that Bill made up on air in February, their last game together and the last time Dave saw him — CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) It is a perfect tribute to Walton by someone who knew him like few do, and a glimpse into the man who was a truly unique force. Another of Walton’s play-by-play partners, Jason Benetti, who called games with him on ESPN and later joined Walton for the always bizarre Throw It Down simulcast on NBA League Pass, posted a similarly fitting tribute to the legend. You sent me an email in 2020 that said: ————- PUT THE MUSIC ON, as soon as it doesn’t seem right, change the music/station, but don’t turn it off ————— I promise, the music will always be on. I’ll miss you dearly, you marvelous, vivid, wonderful — Jason Benetti (@jasonbenetti)",

        "description": "Alex de Minaur has been talking confidently about enjoying his best run at Roland Garros - but a youthful American in Paris stands in his way.",
        "content": "It seems only yesterday the eternally fresh-faced Alex de Minaur was one of the much-touted NextGen hotshots, but now it's a new breed of teen tennis guns who are on his trail. \"He's a tall American, dangerous and with powerful groundstrokes,\" is de Minaur's verdict on his latest young hitman at the French Open, 19-year-old Alex Michelsen, who's already shot down the Australian No.1 once this season on a Mexican hard court. De Minaur is counting on the stocky, 1.93m Californian being a bit greener on the red clay but can't rely on it, with Michelsen, who's up to No.60 and will surely soon join his seven compatriots in the top 50, having downed fellow American world No.12 Taylor Fritz in Geneva last week. \"It should be a tough battle, and hopefully I can get my revenge,\" added de Minaur. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Australian tennis is counting on it, a mite desperate for its main man to prevail after a wretched start to the tournament with five players already out, one withdrawn though injury and not a winner on the board. De Minaur has got used to the responsibility of being the spearhead, and isn't talking down his expectations any more. At a mature 25 and having tasted life in the top 10 this year, he feels a quarter-final place, at least, in every slam should be achievable for him now. On clay, the world No.11 is adamant he's become a different player this year. \"I'm yet to go past the second round here in Paris, so that definitely has to be the first step, but I don't see why I can't play well,\" he told AAP. \"Adapting to clay has been a learning process. A lot of my improvement has probably had to do with me growing into my body a little bit more, getting a little bit stronger. \"My groundstrokes aren't probably as effective on the clay as they would be on other surfaces, so I've got to make sure that I'm nice and strong and physical with it. \"Getting that strength and power to help me out on the clay has been very important and, also understanding the type of tennis that I want to play on the surface and using a little bit more creativity, movement, speed to create more variety. \"It's all clicked together and I've gained a lot of confidence on the surface. And, mentally too, I've told myself that there's no reason why I can't play well on this surface.\" Should calamity befall de Minaur, there's at least one bit of good news on the horizon with one Aussie guaranteed for the second round from the Alexei Popyrin-Thanasi Kokkinakis clash. The shame, as their colleague Max Purcell noted, is that they're both playing well enough to have both gone on a good run. \"I'll be watching though,\" smiled Purcell. \"It's a popcorn match, definitely.\" \"He's one of my better mates on tour,\" says Kokkinakis, revealing that he and Popyrin had decided radio silence between each other might be the best bet before their clash. \"We practise a lot together. It is tricky - but it should be a fun one.\" AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION ON DAY THREE OF THE FRENCH OPEN (PREFIX DENOTES SEEDING): Men's singles Alexei Popyrin v Thanasi Kokkinakis 11-Alex de Minaur v Alex Michelsen (USA) Adam Walton v Arthur Rinderknech (FRA) Rinky Hijikata v Luciano Darderi (ITA)",

        "content": "Crews knocked down a fire at a home in the Gordon Head neighbourhood on Monday (May 27) morning. Nobody was inside the San Juan Avenue home and neighbours told firefighters that it’s been abandoned. “We’ve been through the building, 100 per cent it’s not occupied,” Saanich Fire department Capt. Charlie Rivers said at the scene as crews were packing up shortly after 11:00 a.m. When firefighters arrived, the blaze was all the way up the back of the home. Crews knocked those flames down quickly from the back of the house before they moved inside to extinguish the rest, Rivers said. The home is surrounded by trees on the property, on a street with mainly single-family homes. No damage could be seen from the street. Asked if the incident was being considered suspicious, Rivers said fire investigators are looking into the cause of the blaze as it’s uncommon for something to happen in a vacant building. He added nothing was initially evident in terms of what might’ve started the fire. “My understanding is the house has been vacant for a number of years.”",

        "description": "The OAS clawback is a hated tax measure but pensioners can avoid it or lessen the tax bite with proven strategies.The post Avoid the OAS Clawback: Earn $560 a Year the Smart Way appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Most Canadian pensioners hate the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback or recovery tax. If their annual income is above the OAS threshold, pensioners pay a 15% tax on excess earnings. Since its introduction in 1989, many have discovered strategies to avoid the OAS clawback, if not lessen the tax bite. However, a proven way to offset the recovery tax is to utilize the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). Your OAS pension is not at risk if you generate additional income from the . Pensioners can boost OAS benefits by opting to delay the payments. The maximum amount ($713.34 in 2024) increases by 0.6% per month (7.2% per year) before 70 or a permanent 36% increase in five years. The rationale for this option is that you receive higher benefits when you are older and your income is lower. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows spouses or common-law partners to split their pensions. Pensioners can transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to a spouse who is earning less income. The CRA assumes that the transferring and receiving spouse or common-law partner are 65 or older. Many income investors invest in ( ) for generous dividends. At $13.49 per share, the yield is 8.01%. suggest reducing investments in non-registered accounts if you’re avoiding the OAS clawback. Freehold Royalties is a significant energy sector player but is not an oil producer. The $2.03 billion energy royalty company owns oil and natural gas royalties in Canada (6.2 million acres) and a sizeable, expanding land base in the U.S. (1.1 million gross drilling acres). The company has interests in more than 18,000 producing wells and benefits from the robust drilling activities in the royalty lands. It collects or receives royalty income from over 380 industry operators. Freehold is a royalty-interest owner, and operators spend for or cover all costs such as capital, equipment, operating, and maintenance. Besides the hefty dividend yield, the $2.03 billion energy royalty company pays monthly dividends. A $7,000 investment will produce $560.70 annually, but taxable in a non-registered account. All income, interest, or capital gains inside a TFSA are tax-free. Withdrawals are likewise tax-exempt. A cheaper and eligible stock in a TFSA is ( ). At only $5.82 per share (+10.01% year to date), you can partake in the 6.19% dividend. This $744.5 million company is Canada’s largest refined sugar distributor. It is also a producer of high-margin maple products. Sugar is a low-growth business but a very stable one. Furthermore, the consumer staple stock rarely experiences wild price swings, so price volatility is not a concern. In the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue and net earnings increased 10.3% and 8% year over year to $589.6 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Rogers Sugar’s president and chief executive officer, Mike Walton, said, “The profitable growth we are generating in both our business segments showcases the combined benefits of strong demand for our products.” He added that Rogers Sugar will focus on harnessing this demand. The OAS clawback is a hated tax measure in Canada. If you’re retiring soon, the minimum income threshold for income year 2024 is $90,997. The recovery tax kicks in if your income exceeds the threshold.",

        "content": "On May 23, the Florida home of artist Sean Kingston was raided by a SWAT team. The 14,000-square foot home is in Southwest Ranches, which is located 15 miles outside of Fort Lauderdale and 22 miles outside of Miami. His mother, Janice Turner, were arrested on fraud and theft charges following the raid. Kingston was arrested in Fort Irwin, California, hours later. Authorities from the Broward County Sheriff’s Office executed search and arrest warrants, revealing an alleged scheme that defrauded businesses of over $100,000 in goods. The charges include grand theft, identity fraud, and writing bad checks. Kingston posted on Instagram asserting his and his mother’s well-being and stated that their lawyers are handling the situation. It read: “People love negative energy! I am good, and so is my mother! ... My lawyers are handling everything as we speak.” The post was later deleted, Huffington Post reported. Mother, 61, and son, 34, face “numerous fraud and theft charges,” according to the sheriff’s office, CNN reported. Kingston was born in Miami and is of Jamaican ancestry. When he was three his family moved back to Jamaica. He returned to the U.S. in his late teens. Prior to the raid, on May 20 arrest warrants were issued for Kingston and Turner. The warrants detail an alleged scheme starting October 2023 to defraud several businesses including a jeweler and car dealership of a variety of goods valued at $100,000 or more. The pair were accused of grand theft of property valued around $86,000, grand theft from a car dealership of a luxury car worth about $159,000, and grand theft of jewelry worth $480,000, according to the documents. The raid is linked to a breach of contract lawsuit filed by Ver Ver Entertainment, alleging Kingston failed to pay for a 232-inch, $150,000 TV and sound system. Kingston had promised promotional videos with Justin Bieber in exchange for a lower down payment but did not fulfill the payment or promotional obligations. The case remains under investigation.

        "description": "The former Jaguars kicker was sued and accused of sexual assault following an incident that allegedly occurred during the team's trip to London in 2023.",
        "content": "A pair of flight attendants who were on the Jaguars’ Sept. 28 Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings flight to London last season have sued former Jacksonville kicker Brandon McManus and alleged that he sexually assaulted them during the trip, according to ESPN . McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, allegedly attempted to grind against the women, and when one of them addressed McManus, he “smirked and walked away.” The lawsuit, filed in Duval County Circuit Civil Court on Friday, reportedly is for more than $1 million in damages — with the two women experiencing “severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation,” according to ESPN. The Jaguars declined to comment, according to ESPN, while McManus, 32, hadn’t released a statement as of Monday afternoon. “Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus,” the Commanders said in a statement Monday . “We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.” The lawsuit reportedly alleged that the Jaguars were responsible for “failing to supervise McManus and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team.” ESPN reported that the flight — transporting the Jaguars to London for an Oct. 1 game against the Falcons and an Oct. 8 game against the Bills — allegedly “quickly turned into a party,” and McManus allegedly “recruited three other flight attendants to the party and passed out $100 bills to encourage them to drink and dance inappropriately for him,” according to the outlet. One of the women accused McManus of sexually assaulting her while she was seated during the flight — when McManus allegedly attempted to kiss her — and while serving meals on two different occasions, per the outlet. The second woman was also allegedly sexually assaulted when the second meal was being served, and she reportedly stayed away from McManus during the Jaguars’ flight from London to Jacksonville two weeks later, following the Oct. 8 game, by remaining on the second floor of the plane. McManus will enter his 11th season in the NFL in 2024. He spent the first nine years of his career in Denver before signing with the Jaguars in 2023, when he made 81.1 percent of his kicks and all 35 of his extra-point attempts. The one-year deal that McManus signed with the Commanders is worth $3.6 million. If you have been sexually assaulted and live in New York, you can call 1-800-942-6906 for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the state, you can dial the 24/7 National Sexual Assault hotline at 1-800-656-4673.",

        "content": "Abha were undoubtedly in high spirits heading into the clash after moving out the relegation zone last Thursday with a vital win over Al Khaleej. Mosimane did not tinker with the starting line-up that much, as Fahad Jumayah made way for Meshal Al Mutain at right-back as the only change from Thursday's win. Al-Hazm, who were already relegated, had most of the possession in the first half but were unable to find a way past the Abha defence. After a goalless period, Abha came out firing in the second half and were rewarded two minutes in Ahmed Abdu Jaber found the back of the net. Mosimane's side suffered a set-back just before the hour mark when Al-Hazm levelled matters via the boot of Muhammed Badamosi to set up a tense final 30 minutes in the second half. However, Abha's fate was sealed with ten minutes to play after Mohammed Al-Thani secured the winning goal for the home side. Following the defeat, Mosimane's side dropped to 16th spot after fellow relegation rivals Al Akhdoud beat Al-Tai to save their top-flight status.",

        "content": "We are less than three weeks away until kick off their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia in Germany. Having come so close to victory three years ago, 's men will be desperate to go that one step further on enemy territory to lift their first ever European Championship. We know the 33 players that could lead England to glory, with household names such as Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson missing out on the provisional squad. However, with the final squad needing to be trimmed down to 26, the identities of which seven gut cut remains a mystery. That doesn't mean it's impossible to speculate who these could be, though. With some players more likely to be on the plane than others, the Three Lions' provisional squad have been ranked based on who is most likely to be presenting their country, and who is expected to depart from their holidays. Players have been sorted into five categories, which are: Must start Jordan Pickford, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane Definitely in the squad Aaron Ramsdale, Harry Maguire, Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kobbie Mainoo, Cole Palmer Useful option Dean Henderson, Marc Guehi, Jarrad Branthwaite, Eberechi Eze, Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins, Ivan Toney 50/50 chance Luke Shaw, Ezri Konsa, Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Conor Gallagher, James Madison, Jack Grealish, Jarrod Bowen No hope of going James Trafford, Jarell Quansah, Curtis Jones, Adam Wharton Most of England's starting XI is fairly predictable, but that's thanks to the level of talent these names have. has been the undisputed number one for years and this season has seen his international form finally translate for Everton. He finished the Premier League season with 13 clean sheets, second to only David Raya. In front of him, Manchester City duo and are expected to continue their partnership on the right side of defence. The midfield is likely going to be anchored by and following exceptional seasons at their respective new clubs. Many are clamouring for them to be joined by . If that's not the case, the FWA's Player of the Year will most certainly be a part of the attacking trio which will also include and . The two men who made a name for themselves in North London will line up in their third straight tournament together and be the country's biggest goal threats. With Nick Pope missing out through injury, it seems that will take up a familiar role as back-up goalkeeper this summer, with the Arsenal shot-stopper officially losing his battle to be his country's number one over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, has done himself justice this season. Having endured some difficult campaigns in recent times, his improved form will probably be enough for him to line-up alongside Stones in the heart of a back four. The left side of that defence is where most eyebrows have been raised. With Luke Shaw's status up in the air, could be needed to deputise at left-back, hence his inclusion. Versatility is also the name of the game when it comes to with the Liverpudlian defender even when it comes to his ability in the middle of the park Finally, two young men who last summer wouldn't have been anywhere near the squad now look near certainties to go. and have been pivotal since their emergences. The former scored what turned out to be the decisive goal in the FA Cup final, whereas the latter single-handedly dragged Chelsea into Europe next season. Both are more than worth additions. Cole Palmer finished with 33 goal contributions in 34 Premier League games, more than any other player. The third and final goalkeeping slot is 's for the taking. As the more experienced of the remaining two 'keepers, the former Manchester United man is expected to get the call-up and would be a good hand should catastrophe strike either Pickford or Ramsdale. The two central defenders who are most likely to support Stones are Maguire are and . Both have become key men for Crystal Palace and Everton and the experience of a major tournament will be important in their development to becoming international regulars in the future. , and both provide something a little different should Southgate need some inspiration on the bench. The increased squad size also means that both and can be included as back-ups to main man Kane. Although Watkins has been more potent throughout the season, it was Toney who impressed the most during March's internation friendlies. If it weren't for his injury, would be in the must start category. When fit, he is the best left-back in the country. However, with Southgate himself saying Shaw is in a losing battle against time, his chances of making the final 26 are 50/50 at best. This could make room for as a left-back option, but given that he has featured just twice for England in four years, his place is far from guaranteed. A question mark does hang over . It's not unfathomable to imagine the 32-year-old taking up a similar role in the squad that the likes of Conor Coady has done in the past, tasked with keeping the spirits high rather than being gifted any minutes. But with likely ahead of him, his spot is still up for grabs. In midfield, Mainoo and Palmer's impressive form has cast doubt on and 's roles this summer. Further forward, 's excellent season for West Ham could go unrewarded due to the strength in depth England have, whilst 's stop-start season on the sidelines has made him vulnerable for both his country and It's safe to assume that three out of the four men in this section are nailed on to miss out. , and Adam Wharton are all players who have the potential to represent the Three Lions at some point in the future. However, these uncapped youngsters all happen to play in areas where England have incredible strength in numbers, so forcing their way into this tournament seems near impossible. The fourth man, Jarell Quansah, may have an outside chance though. Despite strong competition in defence, no one outside of the starting duo has definitely got their passport stamped. Could the youthful defender's experience alongside Virgil Van Dijk this season see him become a rogue pick for the final squad?",

        "content": "Jason Kelce had something to say to hecklers who were angry that he distanced himself from the \"homemaker\" dialogue in the NFL world. The Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, recently took to their podcast to discuss controversial comments made by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who told a graduating class that women should endeavor to be \"homemakers\" over focusing on a career. Butker found himself in hot water for his comments and for quoting popstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in his commencement speech at Benedictine College. Nuns affiliated with the college denounced Butker's speech, and the NFL distanced itself from his comments. Related stories On the \"New Heights\" podcast, Travis Kelce said he didn't agree with \"just about any of\" Butker's comments. Jason Kelce, who retired earlier this year from the Philadelphia Eagles, similarly said he did not \"align\" with Butker's views. But Jason Kelce was much more vocal when someone on X, formerly Twitter, made a comment about his wife, Kylie . \"Your wife is a homemaker. But you can't support Butker,\" an X user tweeted at Kelce. \"And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. I'm sorry, but it is dirty and messy on television. It seems you're a bit hypocritical.\" Early Monday morning, Jason Kelce gave a response after having \"seen a number of people say\" similar things. \"I don't think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,\" Kelce wrote on X . \"The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.\" As for their home, Kelce said it is \"both our faults it is messy,\" attributing it to the chaos of mixed schedules and raising three kids. \"We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home,\" he wrote. \"If being a homemaker, works for some, and that's what they want, then hell yea, that's awesome, more power to you. I want to be clear, I'm not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic.\"",

        "content": "Leonardo DiCaprio treats his niece Normandie, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills - 10 years after she was 'abducted' by parents amid family turmoil By Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Sameer Suri For Dailymail.com Published: 21:47, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:54, 27 May 2024 e-mail 11 shares 9 View comments Leonardo DiCaprio treated his niece Normandie Farrar, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills over Memorial Day weekend . While out with his father, George DiCaprio, and stepmother, Peggy Farrar, the 49-year-old Oscar winner was seen spoiling his niece as he took her to various upscale boutiques as well as Tiffany & Co. and Prada. The teenager, who was notoriously 'abducted' at the age of six by her own father, appeared happy as she walked down the sidewalk, alongside her family, with two large shopping bags on her shoulder. DiCaprio attempted to keep a low profile during the outing as he sported a black Dodgers baseball cap, blue face mask, black puffer jacket and a grey t-shirt. After indulging in some retail therapy, the group reportedly enjoyed some quality time together at South Beverly Grill. Leonardo DiCaprio treated his niece Normandie, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills over the weekend The family's sighting comes two months after he and his loved ones enjoyed a rare meal together at Cipriani in Beverly Hills. Normandie's parents, Charity Moore, and Adam Farrar, who is Leo's older stepbrother, were not present on either outing. Charity and Adam have whirled through their share of headline-grabbing legal problems over the years, including a 2016 arrest for alleged petty theft. The 'kidnapping' scandal unfolded in January 2014, when both Adam and Charity were separately arrested on drug charges. Adam was apprehended in Texas, where he had decamped with his daughter - illegally, inasmuch as Normanie was a dependent of the court in California because of her parents' criminal records and was not supposed to be taken out of state. At the time, Normanie was just six-years-old. Normandie was discovered in Texas on January 30 and whisked back to California, where she was placed in the care of her grandfather, Leo's father George DiCaprio. Meanwhile Adam was arrested and accused by the Los Angeles Police Department of 'concealing' his daughter in another state. While out with his father, George DiCaprio, and stepmother, Peggy Farrar, the 49-year-old Oscar winner was seen spoiling his niece as he took her to various upscale boutiques as well as Tiffany & Co. and Prada The teenager appeared happy as she walked down the sidewalk, alongside her family, with two large shopping bags on her shoulder DiCaprio attempted to keep a low profile during the outing as he sported a black Dodgers baseball cap, blue face mask, black puffer jacket and a grey t-shirt At the time, a spokesman for the department of the LA County Department of Children and Family Service told RadarOnline : 'I am happy to confirm that this child has in fact been found. It's great news. Beyond that, I can't really say more.' Before their estrangement Leonardo and his stepbrother, Adam Farrar, used to be close and had been seen attending a number of Los Angeles Lakers games together. In 2014, sources told RadarOnline that the pair 'have had zero contact in recent years and do not get along.' It is widely reported that DiCaprio was inspired to go into acting after he saw his step-brother carve a career for himself in commercials, movies and TV in the 1980s. Farrar is best known for his roles in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica and the ABC comedy-drama Eight is Enough. However, as DiCaprio's career took off in the late 90s and Farrar's came to a standstill, things ended up rather differently for the brothers, who grew up together in LA after DiCaprio's mother, Peggy, married Farrar's father, cartoonist George DiCaprio, when he was just one. Since 2010, Farrar has been in and out of courts on charges of harassment, possession of controlled substances, driving without a license and domestic violence. In 2000, as DiCaprio was riding the success of his blockbuster Titanic, Farrar was arrested on charges that he attempted to kill his then-girlfriend and made terroristic threats. At the time, Peggy DiCaprio said of her troubled stepson: 'Adam is one of the most nonviolent people I know,’ according to New York Daily News . Farrar was released within 48 hours of his March 2000 arrest, and the charges against him were eventually dropped. People Magazine reported that two years earlier, the struggling actor landed in trouble with the law after allegedly assaulting a photographer who was pursuing his superstar sibling. Charges were never filed in that case.

        "description": "OPINION: Whanganui MP Carl Bates on Nicola Willis' first Budget.",
        "content": "Carl Bates is the MP for Whanganui. OPINION Finance Minister Nicola Willis will present her first Budget to Parliament and the nation on Thursday, May 30. The current economic conditions have significantly increased the demands Minister Willis has to balance as she pulls the Budget together. A Treasury briefing the day the Government took office informed them the economy was in danger of a structural deficit. The majority of the increase in Government debt from $5 billion to $100b was the result of the last Government continuing to spend more money than it earned. Much of the spending was in areas that did not improve services or outcomes for New Zealanders on a daily basis. The Finance Minister responded quickly with a mini-Budget in December which found $7.5b in public sector savings. Thursday’s Budget will build on the ethos of spending being reprioritised to areas where it will produce the best outcomes for New Zealanders. The commitment to invest $140 million in new funding for 1500 social houses to be provided by Community Housing Providers (CHPs) is especially welcome and will lead to fewer families living in motels. Likewise, the decision announced this week to fund the Gumboot Friday organisation to provide additional mental health services will enable more young people to have counselling sessions to meet their acute needs. Mental Health Minister Matt Doocey has signalled his intention to fund providers on the front line rather than funding being caught up in the Wellington bureaucracy, an approach I support. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon recently promised there would be “no bells and whistles” in the Budget. Instead, the focus will be on ensuring the basics are done well to rebuild the economy, restore law and order and provide better public services. Education is a particular passion for me, as the father of a new entrant and a preschooler, and I especially welcome the investment into the nationwide rollout of structured literacy programmes. The investment of $53.6m into the training and recruitment of 1500 teachers, announced at the weekend by Education Minister Erica Stanford, is another excellent initiative. And modest tax relief targeted at low and middle-income New Zealanders will help to ease the burden of the cost of living crisis on working New Zealanders. Wages have raced ahead of tax rates, which have not been adjusted for inflation since 2010. As Nicola Willis delivers her Budget tomorrow, I have no doubt it will be a critical element in the coalition Government’s unrelenting quest to get New Zealand Back on Track. Share this article",

        "content": "Former Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Brandon McManus has been accused of sexually assaulting two women on a team flight last year. McManus and the Jaguars are named in a lawsuit by women identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, filed last Friday in Duval County, where Jacksonville is located. The women said the Jaguars did not provide a safe environment for staff on the flight, which took the team to London for consecutive games last fall. They allege McManus of rubbing and grinding against them during the flight. Jane Doe I said McManus tried to kiss her and Jane Doe II said McManus \"smirked and walked away\" after she confronted him about grinding against her. McManus and his attorney have yet to respond to the lawsuit, first reported by ESPN. The Jaguars declined to comment about the lawsuit, which is seeking more than $1 million in damages and a jury trial. McManus was not re-signed by Jacksonville this offseason and has since joined the Washington Commanders on a one-year, $3.6 million contract. \"Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus,\" the Commanders said in a statement. \"We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon's representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\" McManus, 32, spent the first nine years of his 10-year NFL career with the Denver Broncos and signed with the Jaguars in May 2023. --Field Level Media",

A witness provided the description of a possible suspect vehicle, but investigators were seeking more evidence before releasing that information, both stations reported. The identity of the victim was not immediately released. Attempts by The News Tribune to reach a Tacoma police public information officer were not immediately successful.

        "content": "She told OK! Magazine: \"I'm comfortable in my skin. I'm comfortable with where I'm at in my life, in my career and in my relationship. I don't mind getting older. It doesn't freak me out at all. My life's evolved and I'm not seeking the gaze of males and I'm not trying to be a bikini model now. It's not that I can't be a bikini model because I'm 44 and heavier. It's more that I've been there and done that and I don't really care much about how I look anymore.\" The 44-year-old star - who tied the knot with Italian stallion Jeremy Parisi, 38, in 2022 - insists her interests have changed. The brunette beauty - who moved from the Kent countryside to London with her spouse and their pet dog Teddy and is a keen gardener - said: \"I do think that your life changes: you evolve, you grow up and your interests change. I'm now obsessed with my dog and gardening. I can't say I was obsessed with animals and gardening 20 years ago. I moved to my house with Teddy in mind because I wanted a garden and lots of green space and to be able to walk to the green spaces.\" The couple had an intimate wedding in Jeremy's native Italy, but they are still yet to plan their big party for family and friends in the UK. She said: \"We had an incredible wedding and we were watching our wedding video the other day. We're still not over it. I wish we could do it all again. Our wedding was small and Italian-based. I didn't put any pressure on people to come from overseas other than immediate family, and I did promise everyone we would have a big party in London. I haven't got around to that yet, so that needs to happen.\"",

        "content": "Amazon shoppers say they work a treat at banishing pests like flies and mice. Amazon shoppers are hailing pest traps which are being called \"incredibly effective\" at getting rid of pests. Costing less than a tenner, they are said to be perfect for not just people struggling with flies, but people with mice problems too. And you can use them in a variety of places. Costing £8.99, the Pest Sticky Boards by Mossoko contain five sticky board traps to catch the annoying pests. The traps measure 21cm x 31cm and \"covers a large surface are\", according to the Amazon description. The Pest Sticky Boards pad traps can easily used for cockroaches, flies, and other pests and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Some of the areas listed you can use them in include in your gardens, in farms, in warehouses, in your kitchen, behind appliances as well as under sink. You can also use food to attract pests. This includes: The Pest Sticky Boards have four stars out if five on Amazon with the majority giving five stars. Taking to the reviews one wrote: \"I recently purchased the sticky mouse traps from Amazon and they have exceeded my expectations!\" They add: Although they are inhumane and I am saddened on finding the little guys but These traps are incredibly effective in catching mice without any mess or hassle. The strong adhesive on the traps securely holds the mice, preventing them from escaping. The traps are also easy to set up and dispose of, making the whole process quick and convenient. I was amazed at how quickly I caught several mice using these traps. If you're dealing with a mouse problem, I highly recommend giving these sticky mouse traps a try if all other routes have failed.\" Another said: \"Exactly what i needed. Managed to catch 2 mouses hiding in the garage. So works extremely well.\" In a detailed review a third, who gave five stars, said: \"I’ve used similar glue traps before but they were black not yellow. I was interested to see if the bright yellow attracted more flies than the black ones did. Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. \"I’d say it’s pretty even but the yellow does seem have slightly more on. Maybe that’s because these boards are around 1/3 bigger than my black traps, or maybe the flies just like the brightness, I don’t know. Anyway, they work! I have lots and lots of dead little flies on my board. As the boards are so big, I cut them in half (each board is individually wrapped and folded together so there is a crease down the middle you can cut). Best to use a Stanley knife to cut as it made my scissors very sticky! Apple is launching new tablets with a refreshed iPad Air and all-new iPad Pro hitting UK stores. The iPad Air now boasts a more powerful M2 chip housed within its aluminium chassis, increased standard storage, new colours, improved connectivity and extended battery life. For the first time, this tablet also comes in two sizes including a standard 11-inch display and a much larger 13-inch panel. If you're looking to go Pro, there's a significant upgrade with the 2024 range featuring a super slim design, a greatly enhanced OLED screen that's brighter and an incredibly fast M4 processor which makes these tablets faster than most PC laptops. One deal that piqued our interest comes from Sky who are offering the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi and Cellular from just £17 per month with no upfront fee and 100MB of data included as well. You can learn more about the iPad Air deal on Sky's website here. This deal is based on a 48-month contract, with the total cost over four years coming to £816 - in comparison, the same tablet from Apple costs £749, but this doesn't include any data and requires an upfront payment. Sky also offers other deals, including the 13-inch Air for £21 per month or the Pro for £27 per month. As we've previously noted, Sky isn't the only network offering iPads on contract, with Vodafone and EE also providing customers with the option to purchase these devices via a monthly plan. \"These really are such a simple yet effective way of catching the little flies around my houseplants. I can’t comment on if they would catch a mouse (and hope I never have to!!) but they are extremely sticky so they quite possibly could. \"I would certainly recommend these boards and think they are excellent value (especially as I cut them in half, so effectively have 10 boards).\" Not everyone was convinced with one writing: \"Mouse was able to easily pass several times by two rows of the (not so) sticky pad, as it was possible to see by the marks left on a flour trail. Totally useless, don’t waste your money.\" You can buy the pack of five Pest Sticky Boards here or a pack of 10 here for £11.99. Alternatively you can get a pack of 10 PestCatchers Multi Use Sticky Pads Trap from Amazon here for £6.99. Elsewhere you can buy Pest-Stop Rodents Sonic pest repeller at B&Q for £20. You can also shop for a range of rodent catchers on B&Q's website here . Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond. Sign up to our daily newsletter .",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird played at UConn, where she won two NCAA titles and lost only four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA championship games while becoming the Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm , Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players-turned-owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro . However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, earned $12.1 million in his rookie season with San Antonio. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show. AP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",

        "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — It’s just the beginning of the summer swimming season, and Central North Carolina has already seen two drownings. Just in the past week, a teenager drowned at Jordan Lake, and a man drowned in the Neuse River. “The most important thing is to respect the water,” emphasized Mark Gangloff. “I tell my own children, ‘Never ever, ever get in the pool by yourself or in the lake by yourself.’” Gangloff is an Olympic gold medalist and the head swimming and diving coach at UNC, but even with his level of swimming strength and expertise, he’s focused on water safety. “When I’m on a boat with my family, I have a life vest on,” he said. “Even if you think you are a strong swimmer, anything can happen out on the water, and you need to stay safe,” added Isabel Wolk. Wolk, 16, is a competitive swimmer. She recently volunteered with the Army Corps of Engineers to make sure loaner stations around Jordan Lake are stocked with free life jackets to borrow. She says there’s a big difference between swimming in a pool and a lake, and it’s easy to become over-confident. “You think, ‘I can swim wherever, that’s fine. I can swim in the pool where I can touch the bottom. There’s a wall right there,’ but out in the middle of the lake there’s no wall. There can be a current, a boat goes by and there’s a wave, or you don’t see something submerged in the water and you hit your head,” she noted. “So definitely wearing a life jacket is so important.” Life jacket loaner stations are available around Jordan Lake, thanks to a partnership with the Army Corps and Carolina Swims Foundation as well as the Sea Tow Foundation. Sarah Chaires’ work in emergency medicine led her to create the nonprofit focused on drowning prevention. “I was at the bedside of so many drownings and those families in those life-clutching moments where hope turns to grief, to know that it all could be prevented,” she recalled. She says everyone should have swimming lessons, swim near lifeguards, keep family members within an arm’s reach, and designate an adult in the group as a “water watcher” to always have close eyes on the water. Drowning can happen in a matter of seconds and often happens silently. “Usually a drowning victim will go down very slowly and they’ll just sort of sink,” said Gangloff. “You have to be very cognizant of what those drowning signs are. Is the head tilted back, is someone sitting very low in the water? That’s the telltale sign of someone who’s struggling.” Chaires urges everyone to wear a life jacket any time you’re in open water. “In a car you put your seatbelt on, so click that life jacket. Make sure it’s secure; make sure you’ve done all the buckles,” she urged. “It will save your life.”",

It isn’t uncommon for live service games to go through high and low points. Unfortunately, Helldivers 2 has experienced its first low point much sooner than expected due to the PSN controversy and recent weapon nerfs that have turned players away. Now that Arrowhead Game Studios is actively working to fix the balancing issues, with CEO to focus solely on development, some players now want the community to stop complaining and let the developers do what they need to do. to plead with the Helldivers 2 community to calm down on the constant complaining and wait to see what the future holds for the game now that Johan Pilestedt is focused on the development side and updates will be released less frequently. The Reddit user acknowledges that there are things that we need to be vocal about such as “some of the more out-of-pocket balancing, the Major Order rates and how they are shown/affected, better information to the players outside of Discord, patrols, etc.” All very valid and important things to bring up.” They also then noted that the negativity within the community will undoubtedly turn potential players away from the game and that many go into new updates with a negative mindset, such as expecting the to be bad so are less likely to come away with a positive view of it. “We are already complaining and comparing the stats to the mech when it has been out for less than a day? Guys we are becoming the classic bitch and moan-about-everything and no one is gonna want to come here besides other people who are just upset about the game. I’m sure people disagree and that is fine but I’ve been around and this to me is officially the point where we need to chill a little with the constant complaining and negativity.” With weapon balancing being a hot topic right now, it can be difficult to know what is the best loadout to use in the game. To help with this, we highly recommend checking out our and to put you in the best position to serve Liber-tea to the Automatons and Terminids.",

        "content": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani said on Monday that he is making progress in his recovery from Tommy John surgery, per ESPN's Jorge Castillo . According to Castillo, Ohtani began throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani has not pitched since last August when he was still with the Los Angeles Angels. In 23 appearances last season, Ohtani notched a 10-5 record with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts. He underwent Tommy John surgery in September of last year, ending his season on the mound. While the Dodgers are likely eager to get Ohtani back on the mound, the 2023 AL MVP has had an outstanding season as a designated hitter this season. He currently has a .336 batting average and has picked up 131 total bases—both numbers the best in the majors. He also leads the NL in slugging percentage and OPS. In 53 games, Ohtani has notched 13 homers and 35 RBI, good for seventh and 14th-best in the majors, respectively. The Dodgers sit at the top of the NL West at 33-22, though they have lost their last five games and are looking to get back on track against the New York Mets this week. Los Angeles is looking to bounce back from back-to-back divisional series exits with a big postseason this year. With the addition of Ohtani, reaching a World Series seems well within reach for the Dodgers. When the star is back on the mound, it could lead to even more success for Los Angeles.",

South American prosecutors told a London court that Nicolas Gomes De Brito, 25, was a drug dealer who had a rival shot dead. He then fled to Britain and was arrested two years ago after an international police request and held in jail. Yet despite an extradition treaty and what a British judge accepted was 'a strong case' against him, De Brito was freed in January. He claimed he would face discrimination in Brazil because he is gay, to the surprise of police who say he left his wife there. Nicolas Gomes De Brito, a Brazilian in a global murder hunt has been freed to walk British streets because a judge feared jails in his homeland would breach his human rights (pictured: the murder scene) South American prosecutors told a London court that De Brito (pictured), 25, was a drug dealer who had a rival shot dead. He then fled to Britain and was arrested two years ago after an international police request and held in jail But he won his freedom by arguing Brazilian prisons were crowded and he faced torture in custody. Judge Briony Clarke ruled there were insufficient assurances of his safety if extradited, saying she was swayed by evidence on the poor conditions in the jail be would be held in. Now De Brito is understood to have melted away into London, where he previously lived in a semi in Wembley. He remains on global most-wanted lists. De Brito is accused of being in a feud with rival William Pereira De Paiva since 2016 after surviving an attempt on his life. De Brito is accused of being in a feud with rival William Pereira De Paiva (pictured) since 2016 after surviving an attempt on his life When a close friend of De Brito was shot and left paraplegic in 2018, he named De Paiva as being behind the shooting (pictured: the car at the murder scene) Prosecutors told Westminster magistrates that De Brito began working with one of De Paiva's former henchmen, a teenager known as JR. When a close friend of De Brito was shot and left paraplegic in 2018, he named De Paiva as being behind the shooting. De Paiva was arrested but was set free the next year when De Brito is said to have arranged for JR to kill him.

        "content": "We’re approaching the end of first quarter earnings season with 92% of companies listed in the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results. By and large, it has been a strong period. In all, 78% of companies announced better-than-expected profits, and according to FactSet , 59% beat expectations with their sales. Many analysts are crediting the strong corporate earnings with reversing the stock market decline seen in April. While many companies came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, a few delivered truly exceptional Q1 prints. Surging profits and record sales led some stocks to rise 10% or more in a single trading session. A few companies surprised analysts with results that were not as bad as feared. Others delivered their first financials as a publicly traded company. The positive surprises have helped to improve sentiment and the outlook among investors. Here are three Q1 superstars to buy after stellar earnings. Honda Motor (HMC) Japanese automaker Honda Motor (NYSE: HMC ) had a great print , announcing that its net profit increased 70% from a year earlier. The company is benefitting from a surge in gas-electric hybrid vehicle sales. Honda’s annual profit totaled $7 billion as sales rose nearly 21% during the fiscal year, which ended March 31. The company said weak sales in China were offset by strong sales in the U.S. Honda sold 2.8 million vehicles globally over the last year, up from 2.3 million in the previous fiscal year. Sales also rose in Honda’s home market of Japan and in Europe. Honda and other automakers have had success with hybrid vehicles , which are gaining popularity with consumers who have grown weary of fully-electric cars. Despite the strong results, Honda provided a downbeat outlook for the current fiscal year, saying it expects its profit to decline nearly 10%. Management said the decline in profit will not be due to slower vehicle sales but increased research and development (R&D) spending that should total $7.7 billion. Honda said it is reinvesting profits to secure its future competitiveness. HMC stock has gained 22% over the last 12 months. Robinhood Markets (HOOD) A boom in the trading of cryptocurrencies pushed Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD ) to record Q1 financial results . The online brokerage announced earnings per share ( EPS ) of 18 cents on record revenue of $618 million. The results crushed Wall Street forecasts that called for earnings of 6 cents a share and revenue of $553 million. A year ago, Robinhood reported a loss of 57 cents per share on revenue of $441 million. The company attributed the strong results to a rise in crypto trading on its platform. Crypto boomed to start the year, with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hitting an all-time high of just under $74,000 on March 14. Consequently, crypto transaction revenue at Robinhood more than tripled from a year earlier. Assets under custody increased 65% year-over-year to $129.6 billion due to higher stock and crypto valuations. More subscribers joined the Robinhood Gold service that provides investors with advanced tools and market data. The company reported 1.7 million Gold subscribers at the end of Q1, up 42% from a year ago. Robinhood’s share price has risen 86% in the past 12 months, making it a stock to buy on earnings results. Reddit (RDDT) Social media platform Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ) just reported its first financial results as a public company. The print was so good, it sent RDDT stock up more than 10%. Reddit held its initial public offering ( IPO ) in March of this year. Now, the company behind online message boards, has reported a loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 which was expected among analysts. Reddit’s revenue totaled $243 million versus the $212.8 million that was expected on Wall Street. The still unprofitable company said its sales rose 48% from a year earlier. Reddit also reported $222.7 million in advertising revenue, up nearly 40% YOY. The company had 82.7 million daily active users at the end of Q1, almost a million more than the 76.6 million that had been forecast. Average revenue per user rose 8% to $2.94. Looking ahead , Reddit’s management team said they expect revenue of $240 million to $255 million for Q2, topping expectations of $224 million. RDDT stock is now 16% higher than where it closed during its first day of trading on March 21.

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has broken a Saudi Pro League record after another stunning campaign. The Al Nassr forward scored two goals in their league finale against Al Ittihad - a match that they won 4-2 to confirm second spot in the table. In doing so, Ronaldo reached 35 goals for the season, breaking the previous record of 34 set by Abderrazak Hamdallah back in 2019/20. As well as scoring 35 goals in 31 games, the 39-year-old also contributed 11 assists for Al-Nassr in his first full campaign for the club. But his achievements are about way more than just one successful season. After finishing as top goalscorer in the Saudi Pro League, Ronaldo has extended a pretty staggering record. As a result of his achievements, Ronaldo has now become the first player to be top goalscorer in four different top flights - the Premier League, LaLiga, Serie A and the Saudi Pro League. Winning the Premier League golden boot with Man United in 2008, the Portuguese star was LaLiga's top goalscorer on three occasions before becoming Serie A's top scorer in 2020/21. The only top-tier league that he hasn't finished as top goalscorer in is the Liga Portugal where Ronaldo scored three goals in 25 games as a fresh-faced teenager in 2002/03. Ronaldo has just one year remaining on his contract with Al-Nassr, with the Saudi side desperate to keep him in the league longer term. Ronaldo will now be hoping to guide Portugal to glory at Euro 2024 which gets underway next month.",

        "content": "Former U.S. ambassador and former Republican contender for the presidency Nikki Haley toured southern Israel on Monday, laying some of the blame on Iran and Russia for the Oct. 7 massacre of Israeli citizens by the terrorist group Hamas. was accompanied by Israel’s former permanent representative to the U.N. Danny Danon, now a member of the Israeli Knesset, as she looked on at communities still feeling the effects of the Hamas attacks that left more than 1,200 Jews dead. Watch: Former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley visited the Re’im Forest in southern Israel where Hamas terrorists massacred partygoers at the Nova Festival on October 7th. During her visit, Haley heard first-hand accounts from survivors of the massacre. 🎥Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS — Israel National News – Arutz Sheva (@ArutzSheva_En) According to , Haley addressed the local media and stated in no uncertain terms she did not feel is the only culprit. Together with Ambassador , we toured Israel’s South today. We visited Kibbutz Nir Oz, the site of the ‘Nova’ festival, and Sderot, and spoke with survivors of the October 7th massacre. During the tour, Ambassador Haley said: “Don’t listen to what is being said in the... — Danny Danon 🇮🇱 דני דנון (@dannydanon) “[If] you think this will only be in Israel, if we are arrogant enough this could absolutely happen in America too,” Haley said. She said the unprecedented violence against the Jewish state was “orchestrated by Iran.” She added, “It was helped with Russian intelligence. And it was fueled by money from China. Don’t deny that.” It was not clear what Haley was referring to when she said China funded the Hamas attacks. In 2021, reported that Beijing had inked a 25-year deal and agreed to invest $400 billion into Iran’s economy in exchange for discounted oil. In partially blaming China for the carnage of last fall, Haley struck out at the . “China’s been funding Iran the entire time,” she said before she lit into . “Russia’s intelligence helped them know where everything was,” she said of the Hamas militants who murdered, raped and kidnapped Israelis in the early morning assault. “Iran helped get them trained,” she said. “So this isn’t Hamas. These are all murderers and accomplices. If we really mean it’s never going to happen again, we have to be honest and truthful with ourselves who did this.” In October, in the hours after the Hamas attacks, intelligence officials in the U.S. and abroad told that many of the who had engaged in the attack on innocent Jews were trained and funded by the Iranian government. Some of them entered southern Israel from Gaza . Those officials concluded Hamas would not have been capable of launching such a complex offensive without the help of Iran. “The amount of training, logistics, communication, personnel, and weapons required provides a massive footprint,” Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA senior operations officer, told the Post. “This suggests both Iranian involvement, given the complexity of the attack, and highlights the colossal intelligence failure.” We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "content": "This is now the Nvidia era. Nvidia is to AI what Amazon AWS is to websites. Good People, before this age of AI, Nvidia was just another microelectronics company. When I interviewed for Intel, coming out of PhD, in Ronler Acres campus in Hillsboro Oregon, no one in that panel saw it as something different. A week later, I was in Analog Devices, the conversation was on Texas Instruments, as Nvidia was way off from its focus. I decided for Analog Devices because of an amazing Apple project. But here we are: Nvidia is now the industry and more. Intel has lost ground to AMD. AMD itself was a failed company which magically resurrected. They say in social media tech, it is just one click away; I will say in hardware, it is just how transistors are organized. For Nvidia, though, it goes beyond transistors. Yes, Nvidia’s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a huge moat. CUDA allows developers to write code that runs on NVIDIA GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for various tasks, including scientific simulations, machine learning, and deep learning. By providing a powerful and efficient framework for GPU programming, CUDA has become a cornerstone of NVIDIA’s software ecosystem. You can make better chips, but you still have to beat CUDA.

These companies will power the empires of the future because before those clicks, likes, etc, transistors must fire, and someone must organize them.

        "content": "HALIFAX — The head of a non-profit group working to promote reproductive health says New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs is undermining efforts to give students access to honest, evidence-based sex education that answers their questions. Teresa Norris, president of the Montreal-based organization behind a high school presentation that Higgs recently blasted on social media, said Monday the premier is taking one slide from the presentation out of context. She said her group has been teaching in New Brunswick schools for years and she is \"incensed\" that it's now being targeted. \"It's unacceptable that he's giving this impression that it's not appropriate, when all the topics we're covering fall within the learning areas New Brunswick has chosen for its curriculum,\" Norris said in an interview Monday. Her organization HPV Global Action operates the Thirsty for the Talk sexual education group, and she said she has delivered the presentation to about 12 New Brunswick high schools this year. She said the material has been vetted by the provincial Department of Education. \"We need to be refuting (the idea) that there's a problem with offering evidence-based, age-appropriate, sexual health education,\" she said, because without the chance to learn about sex and ask potentially difficult questions youth are \"going to look more and more online, where what they find may be anything but accurate.\" On Friday Higgs posted a slide from the presentation on social media and announced the group would be banned from future presentations. \"To say I am furious would be a gross understatement,\" he wrote. His office and the Department of Education did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. The slide Higgs shared featured four questions: \"Do girls masturbate?\" — \"Does it hurt when you do it for the first time?\" — \"Is it good or bad to do anal?\" — \"Is it normal to watch porn like people watch TV series?\" Higgs said he had heard from concerned parents who shared photos and screenshots of material Norris delivered that is \"clearly inappropriate,\" adding: \"Children should be protected, and parents should be respected.\" He said the Department of Education told him the presentation was supposed to be about human papillomavirus (HPV) and the group shared materials beyond that scope. Norris said this is not true, and the group’s presentation covers safe sex, healthy relationships, abstinence and consent, which coincides with the high school curriculum. She said she has so far not received any communication from the province since Higgs's post banning her group. Another slide from the same presentation asks: \"Do you have an unhealthy relationship with someone?\" and tells students they have the right to feel safe, they shouldn't do something that makes them feel uncomfortable, and if they are concerned about a potentially unhealthy relationship, they should talk to someone about it. Another slide says four out of five people have had HPV at some point, citing 2022 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are not promoting any sexual behaviour ... our ultimate goal is to destigmatize conversations about sexual health so young people can get accurate information,\" Norris said. She said this is of particular importance in New Brunswick, where the teen pregnancy rate was seven births per 1,000 teenage girls in 2022, compared to the national average of about four births per 1,000 teenage girls. A 2019 report on sexual health education in the province published by University of New Brunswick researchers says youth in the province have a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy, sexual violations and dating violence that is \"suggestive of high-risk sexual behaviours and a lack of knowledge regarding sexual consent, personal safety, and understanding of healthy relationship characteristics.\" Norris said when students don't have access to quality sexual education, they turn to the internet where they may find dangerous misinformation and easy access to pornography. \"If we're not providing students with sound, evidence-based resources, they are going to go out on (the internet) on the platforms and they're going to think: 'Well if I see it on Pornhub or in a porn clip that's easily accessible, I guess that's the way it works.'\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

The slide Higgs shared featured four questions: \"Do girls masturbate?\" — \"Does it hurt when you do it for the first time?\" — \"Is it good or bad to do anal?\" — \"Is it normal to watch porn like people watch TV series?\" Higgs said he had heard from concerned parents who shared photos and screenshots of material Norris delivered that is \"clearly inappropriate,\" adding: \"Children should be protected, and parents should be respected.\" He said the Department of Education told him the presentation was supposed to be about human papillomavirus (HPV) and the group shared materials beyond that scope. Norris said this is not true, and the group’s presentation covers safe sex, healthy relationships, abstinence and consent, which coincides with the high school curriculum. She said she has so far not received any communication from the province since Higgs's post banning her group. Another slide from the same presentation asks: \"Do you have an unhealthy relationship with someone?\" and tells students they have the right to feel safe, they shouldn't do something that makes them feel uncomfortable, and if they are concerned about a potentially unhealthy relationship, they should talk to someone about it. Another slide says four out of five people have had HPV at some point, citing 2022 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are not promoting any sexual behaviour ... our ultimate goal is to destigmatize conversations about sexual health so young people can get accurate information,\" Norris said. She said this is of particular importance in New Brunswick, where the teen pregnancy rate was seven births per 1,000 teenage girls in 2022, compared to the national average of about four births per 1,000 teenage girls. A 2019 report on sexual health education in the province published by University of New Brunswick researchers says youth in the province have a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections, unplanned pregnancy, sexual violations and dating violence that is \"suggestive of high-risk sexual behaviours and a lack of knowledge regarding sexual consent, personal safety, and understanding of healthy relationship characteristics.\" Norris said when students don't have access to quality sexual education, they turn to the internet where they may find dangerous misinformation and easy access to pornography. \"If we're not providing students with sound, evidence-based resources, they are going to go out on (the internet) on the platforms and they're going to think: 'Well if I see it on Pornhub or in a porn clip that's easily accessible, I guess that's the way it works.'\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "The Chartered Risk Management Institute of Nigeria has conferred its fellowship on the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Zenith Bank Plc, Ebenezer Onyeagwu. The certification was presented to Onyeagwu during a courtesy visit by executives of CRMI, led by the President and Chairman of Council, Dr Ezekiel Oseni, to Zenith Bank’s head office in Lagos recently. During the visit, Oseni commended Zenith Bank for its outstanding risk management practices and contributions to the broader financial community. “Looking at how far you have come, aside from the leadership over the years, we observed that your risk management function has been fantastic. Your risk management function is well established, and we see the quality of staff you have there. This is a testament to other banks and organisations that risk management is not a deal stopper, but a business enabler,” he enthused. In his response, Onyeagwu emphasised the critical importance of risk management across various sectors, advocating for mandatory CRMI membership for fintech companies, listed firms, the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, and its related enterprises. He said, “Risk management needs to be entrenched in every facet of organisational life. Every financial institution, technology organisation, and listed company should be institutional members of CRMI because risk management is not just for financial institutions.” He also stressed the need for enhanced risk management training, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of digital fraud. Onyeagwu further proposed that the National Universities Commission introduce risk management as a course in higher institutions to build capacity in the niche profession. During the presentation of the fellowship certificate, Oseni noted, “This is not an honorary certificate; it is one that you have earned. We are proud to formally present it to you.” The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System said that financial institutions lost about N17.67bn to financial fraud in 2023.",

        "content": "Ottawa Police Chief Eric Stubbs says the opening of the new Rideau Centre police hub has been delayed because some items needed for the office have not yet arrived. A previous report said the Neighbourhood Operations Centre (NOC) on the first floor of the Rideau Centre shopping mall would be open by June 3 , but speaking to reporters Monday, Stubbs said there are some issues delaying the opening. \"We're just having some supply chain issues with some key parts to get that office up and running,\" he said. \"It's imminent, but it's not here yet.\" Stubbs didn't specify what 'key parts' of office had not yet arrived. \"It's just simply some of the things that we have ordered for the office that we expected to be in by this time,\" he said. \"We got the keys to the office, in terms of our facilities doing what we call the outfit on it, getting it ready for our members in the community to work from and, unfortunately, there are just some things that have not yet arrived to finish it off.\" An Ottawa Police Service spokesperson did not provide any additional details about what specific items are delayed. \"Sorry, we have no further details to convey than what Chief Stubbs spoke to during the scrum,\" an email said. Stubbs said the office should be ready \"in a couple of weeks.\" He added that the police service would communicate with the public when a date for the NOC opening has been confirmed. The NOC is part of the 'Community Outreach Response and Enforcement' (CORE) Strategy. Stubbs said despite there being a delay in opening the NOC, the CORE strategy is ready to go. \"Obviously, it's very important to our strategy ... that work has started and will continue despite just not the formal opening of that. It would be nicer to have that building open, but we're ready to go to start our work in the ByWard Market.\" The new CORE Strategy includes officers targeting \" hot spots of high crime concentration \" and focused enforcement \"identifying high-harm offenders,\" according to police. Plans for the focused efforts in the Rideau Street and ByWard Market area will involve \"increasing visible police presence\" in high-priority areas. The Rideau Centre hub will not be open to the public when it first opens. The Neighbourhood Resources Team and Community Police will use the centre to coordinate operations, hold briefings and host community meetings.",

        "content": "Marcus Rashford has announced he is quitting social media in the wake of Manchester United 's win in the FA Cup final. Rashford played 74 minutes at Wembley on Saturday to help United beat fierce rivals Manchester City and lift the trophy. The attacker has endured a miserable season for the Red Devils, scoring just eight goals in all competitions. He has come under intense criticism for his performances, with some suggestions United could be open to selling him this summer. Given his wretched form, England boss Gareth Southgate also opted to leave Rashford out of his squad for Euro 2024. Now, the United star has revealed he will taking a break from social media at the start of the summer. As he announced the move, Rashford also took the chance to fire back at his critics. Anthony Martial confirms Man Utd exit after nine years with emotional message Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' He tweeted: \"It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\" Immediately after the final win, Rashford has posted a series of pictures to commit his future to United. First, he posted a photo from the pitch, with the caption reading: \"People want to know what Man United means to me!\" He then posted a picture from the dressing room holding up the trophy, with his caption reading: \"The winning team.\" Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo secured the win, with boss Erik ten Hag left delighted.

Rashford helped Manchester United win the FA Cup on Saturday ( Image: Getty Images) \"As always the rivalry is always there and it is always much more important when you play against a team from your own city. For us it was not about this, it was about proving a point after having such a bad year,\" he said. \"Every time we had to survive. The team showed so much resilience and I am so proud of them. Football is about winning trophies at the end of the day. I want to play the best football, attacking football, dynamic football. \"But in the end, you have to win games and trophies. That is the mentality we brought in and we had only one opportunity this season, in the FA Cup. I am very proud of the players and the staff because they did a fantastic job. \"I am proud as well, firstly of the players and the staff. The fans for the whole season, I remember at Crystal Palace a few weeks ago we were bad and they still backed us, they are incredible.

        "content": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canacol Energy (OTC: CNNEF ) Ltd. (\"Canacol\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: CNE; OTCQX: CNNEF; BVC: CNEC) is pleased to provide the following update regarding scheduled interest payment, termination of Fitch Ratings coverage, and exploration drilling program. Interest Payment On May 24, 2024, Canacol paid its scheduled semi-annual interest payment of US $14.375 million on its November 2028 Senior Notes. Rating Agency Update On Tuesday, May 21, 2024, the Corporation informed Fitch Ratings that it was terminating its contract for the provision of ratings coverage. The Corporation retains the services of both Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) and S&P Ratings. Cardamomo-1 Exploration Well The Corporation is preparing to drill the Cardamomo-1 exploration well located in the northern part of its 100% operated VIM-5 Exploration and Production (E&P) contract situated approximately 25 kilometers to the north of its Jobo gas processing facility. The Cardamomo-1 exploration well will target potential gas bearing sands within the Cienaga de Oro (CDO) reservoir, in a large well defined structural closure identified on the Redoblante 3D seismic survey acquired in 2023. Similar to all of the other large discoveries the Corporation has made in the past, including the Clarinete, Nelson, Aguas Vivas, and Pandereta gas fields, the Cardamomo prospect exhibits a well-defined AVO attribute, a seismic characteristic commonly associated with the presence of gas within the CDO reservoir. The Corporation plans to spud the well in late July 2024, and anticipates that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to drill and complete the well. Given success, the Cardamomo field will be tied into the Alboka flowline located approximately 12 kilometers to the south. The Cardamomo prospect is one of 14 CDO exploration prospects identified on the newly acquired Redoblante 3D seismic survey, and should it prove successful will open up a new productive gas area for the Corporation within the northern part of the VIM-5 E&P contract. About Canacol Canacol is a natural gas exploration and production company with operations focused in Colombia. The Corporation's common stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the OTCQX in the United States of America, and the Colombia Stock Exchange under ticker symbol CNE, CNNEF, and CNEC, respectively.

(\"Canacol\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: CNE; OTCQX: CNNEF; BVC: CNEC) is pleased to provide the following update regarding scheduled interest payment, termination of Fitch Ratings coverage, and exploration drilling program. Interest Payment On May 24, 2024, Canacol paid its scheduled semi-annual interest payment of US $14.375 million on its November 2028 Senior Notes. Rating Agency Update On Tuesday, May 21, 2024, the Corporation informed Fitch Ratings that it was terminating its contract for the provision of ratings coverage. The Corporation retains the services of both Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) and S&P Ratings. Cardamomo-1 Exploration Well The Corporation is preparing to drill the Cardamomo-1 exploration well located in the northern part of its 100% operated VIM-5 Exploration and Production (E&P) contract situated approximately 25 kilometers to the north of its Jobo gas processing facility. The Cardamomo-1 exploration well will target potential gas bearing sands within the Cienaga de Oro (CDO) reservoir, in a large well defined structural closure identified on the Redoblante 3D seismic survey acquired in 2023. Similar to all of the other large discoveries the Corporation has made in the past, including the Clarinete, Nelson, Aguas Vivas, and Pandereta gas fields, the Cardamomo prospect exhibits a well-defined AVO attribute, a seismic characteristic commonly associated with the presence of gas within the CDO reservoir. The Corporation plans to spud the well in late July 2024, and anticipates that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to drill and complete the well. Given success, the Cardamomo field will be tied into the Alboka flowline located approximately 12 kilometers to the south. The Cardamomo prospect is one of 14 CDO exploration prospects identified on the newly acquired Redoblante 3D seismic survey, and should it prove successful will open up a new productive gas area for the Corporation within the northern part of the VIM-5 E&P contract.

        "description": "In the market for new wheels? Here's how fast Razor's top-shelf model of Dirt Rocket youth bikes, the MX650, can go, and how much weight it can safely hold.",
        "content": "When you think of the Razor brand, you might think of those small metal kick-scooters you rode around on when you were a kid. If that's all you remember about Razor, though, you might want to look again. Over the last couple of decades, Razor has established quite a repertoire of kid-friendly conveyance for itself. It still deals in kick-scooters, of course, but it also offers skateboards, hoverboards, compact dirt bikes, and a big, heavy electric version of its iconic scooter . Razor also launched its classic scooter in a grown-up version , but for the most part, it specializes in kid-sized stuff. Although most of its products aren't something you could take out onto the open road, Razor's offerings are still pretty impressive even for kids. One particularly interesting entry into Razor's array of battery-powered vehicles is the Dirt Rocket series of dirt bikes, including the MX125 , MX350 , MX500 , and MX650 models. These battery-powered beasties are excellent for young bikers, with the higher-end model able to hit higher speeds and safely carry larger riders as well. The question is, though, exactly how much weight and speed are we talking about here? Each of the four bikes in the Dirt Rocket series can carry slightly different levels of weight, making the higher-grade ones better suited for larger, older riders. If you're thinking about getting one of these bikes as an exorbitant birthday present for your child, you should think carefully about how old they are and how much they weigh. If they're too big, the bike won't be able to function. The MX650 model has the highest weight limit of all of the bikes in the Dirt Rocket line. It is intended for ages 16 and up and can carry up to 220 lbs. According to Stanford Medicine , the average 18-year-old male weighs between 116 and 202 pounds, and the average female of the same age weighs between 100 and 178 pounds. So, this bike would be a good choice for a young adult who's interested in dirt biking but can't or doesn't want to drop the kind of cash necessary for a full-on dirt bike. Obviously, a kid-sized dirt bike isn't going to output the same level of speed as some of the best dual sport motorcycles for expert riders . It wouldn't be even remotely safe or legal. That said, the Dirt Rocket line can output a decent amount of speed, perfect for zooming around a modestly-sized backyard or across a dirt road. As the top-shelf model in the Dirt Rocket line, the MX650 goes up to 17 miles per hour, powered by a 650W variable speed motor. Thanks to its 36V onboard battery pack, the MX650 can operate for up to 40 minutes continuously. As a vehicle for older kids and young adults, the MX650 is designed to generate more torque and power for going up hills safely, something that might not be safer for younger, smaller riders. It would probably be best to operate one of these bikes on the same roads you would a pedal-powered bicycle.",

        "description": "Kingsway Ave is a street of mainly older wooden Californian-style bungalows.",
        "content": "New public housing units craned onto a Sandringham site have shocked locals who said the places looked more like shipping containers than residences. The six new apartments in two blocks, each of three levels, are at 15 Kingsway Ave and locals said they were amazed that it took only a day for them to be craned into place. But many are scathing too: “We’re starting to look like ghetto cities that we see in other countries,” said one. “Containers seem to be the new norm for Kāinga Ora,” said another. “They look like those storage containers put on top of each other,” said one. “These stick out and not in a good way,” said another in a social media group, reflecting Rotorua people’s views . Prefabricated housing business Ecotech imported the units from China, describing themselves as “a next generation construction company that is turning traditional building on its head, delivering architectural quality buildings faster and more affordably than ever before”. Neighbours said the buildings only arrived on the weekend but they were surprised at the appearance in a street which is mainly older wooden Californian-style bungalows with some brick and tile single-level units. But Patrick Dougherty, Kāinga Ora’s general manager of construction and innovation, defended the result, saying the Crown entity was developing its land using offsite manufacturing. Buying the units from China for that Sandringham site had cost savings, he indicated. “This construction method is not new to Kāinga Ora and we work with both New Zealand-based suppliers and established offshore manufacturing facilities to deliver homes. “Developments using off-site manufacturing require local workforces for site works, consultants, tradespeople and construction professionals. All OSM modular units are built in accordance with approved building consent plans and are compliant with all NZ standards,” he said. Such methods can reduce material waste and construction time, providing quality, warm homes at a faster pace than traditional builds. “The finished design of this particular development was reviewed by our independent expert design panel, and is used in many of our medium-density developments throughout Aotearoa. The six two-bedroom apartments will provide warm, dry, modern homes for individuals and whānau in the area,” Dougherty said. Tony Frost of Ecotech Construction and Civil said the units were certainly not shipping containers but he refused to say how much the business was selling each apartment to Kāinga Ora for, saying that was commercially sensitive. “These are definitely not containers or modified containers. We just use the container corner castings for safe transportation of the modules and structural connections on site. The modules are designed for ease of assembly on sites in all location in New Zealand. When the balconies and facades are added, they look very good,” Frost said. Apartments have bathrooms, kitchens, a fridge, window dressings and laundries, he said. Ecotech says swapping traditional wood framing for an ultra-strong structural steel chassis means the multi-pod modules can stack up to seven levels high. Projects can be completed two to three times faster but at 40 per cent less cost with no compromise on quality. Maxion Civil is the site contractor on the Sandringham site. On January 12, Kāinga Ora wrote to neighbours, warning of rock breaking, excavation, filling, compacting and concrete cutting. Noise and vibration would be monitored and minimised to reduce the effects on surrounding neighbours who were given contact details for project manager Holden Xie of Maxion. Ecotech homes are also up at Nugget Ave, Hobsonville Point . Developer Tony Houston also got places from Tony Frost’s business via China. Building more standardised homes in China and shipping them here in only two to three weeks, with another month of on-site works, is his answer to unaffordability, Houston indicated three years ago. The Herald previously reported Frost saying Ecotech had exclusive New Zealand rights for Yahgee international products which he was then selling for Houston’s Hobsonville Point development. “But don’t call them container homes. They’re not, they’re bigger than containers for a start,” said Houston. At the time, 23 Nugget Ave was for sale for just over $800,000.

        "content": "Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been \"comprehensive and multifaceted\" efforts to combat antisemtisim. \"Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia's president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a \"disgraceful\" attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. \"I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.\" Gertler said the school's senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university's faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the \"disgraceful historical practice\" of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. \"Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, \"processes are ongoing.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "content": "A Colorado rancher feeding his cattle was struck to death by lightning along with 34 of his cows. Mike Morgan, 51, was giving his animals food from a trailer when the bolt hit him around 2pm on Saturday, said the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Bystanders and first responders performed life-saving measures on Morgan but he was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘Our deepest condolences go out to family and friends during this difficult time,’ stated the sheriff’s office. The lightning hit an area of open pasture near the town of Rand as well as more than 100 head of cattle that were gathered around the trailer filled with hay, said the county coroner, George Crocket. ‘All but the 34 got up,’ Crocket said of the cattle. Morgan’s wife and father-in-law were close by at the time the bolt struck and survived, he added. Rand is located about 80 miles northwest of Denver. The death shocked the tight-knit community where neighbors all knew each other, Crockett said. Morgan was killed as powerful storms caused twisters, flooding and heavy winds in states including Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas, over Memorial Day Weekend. The storms have killed at least 21 people. The system moved from the central US to the East Coast on Monday and grounded flights at John F Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York .

No deaths have been recorded in Jackson County from 1980 to 2021, which is the time frame that the National Weather Service ( NWS ) has tracked lightning deaths and injuries. Within Colorado, El Paso and Larimer counties had the most such deaths within those four decades. The CDC advises that residents avoid being near windows, porches, concrete, electrical equipment and water during thunderstorms. Meanwhile, the NWS advises staying inside, though people have also been struck while under shelter. Morgan’s died nearly a year after a public works worker hit by lightning on a soccer field in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, was saved by a cop who performed CPR on him.

        "content": "The federal Competition Bureau says it's going to look the domestic air travel industry in Canada, and it's looking for input from Canadians as it prepares to study the market in the coming months. The agency, which is tasked with enforcing competition law in Canada, said in a press release listing the reasons for its study that domestic airfare in Canada \"appears to be relatively high\" and that Canadians are filing more complaints about air travel recently. The bureau also noted that domestic air travel is \"concentrated\" with only two major airlines — Westjet and Air Canada — and that new airlines seem to have difficulties joining the industry here. \"What we're trying to do here is study how competition is working in the sector, really with a view to making recommendations to government,\" said deputy commission Anthony Durocher. \"Why this matters is because we know that competition means lower prices, more choice, more innovation.\" Public invited to comment The Competition Bureau has asked Canadians to weigh on the upcoming study's terms of reference, essentially requesting public comment on the scope or potential limitations of the upcoming study. The tentative, draft terms of reference mention that the bureau wants to answer questions, such as, \"How can policymakers further support airline entry and expansion?\" and, \"How can policymakers further support consumers when shopping for airfares?\" Competition could bring 'lower prices; for air travel in Canada, says the bureau, which will be looking at there are only two dominant players in the domestic market. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) The public has until June 17, 2023, to submit feedback, after which the bureau will finalize terms of reference and officially launch the market study, which is planned to be completed by summer 2025. The report would make recommendations to government, but is not looking at any specific allegations of wrongdoing. Airport costs too high: Flair Air The Competition Bureau's draft for the study includes questions around whether Canadians would be willing to use \"secondary or more distant\" airports, but industry players point out one factor is they believe airport costs or rents in this country are too high, which is being passed on to customers. \"When you look at the cost of operating to a Canadian airport, relative to one in the US [or Europe], the airport fees are much higher here,\" said Garth Lund, chief commercial officer with Flair Airlines in Vancouver. \"The whole ecosystem in Canada is very expensive when it comes to aviation and airports are a big piece of that,\" said Lund, whose airline positions itself as a low-cost carrier. He called fees like that a \"main contributing factors to higher airfares.\" Defunct Lynx Air selling off life-jackets, oxygen masks in bid to recoup losses Flair Airlines CEO bullish on future of discount airlines. Others aren't so sure It's a message echoed by Westjet CEO Alexis von Hoensbroech, who told CBC Radio's The Calgary Eyeopener in an interview that \"the government should actually stop collecting rent from airports\" as one step toward addressing affordability. The Competition Bureau wants to hear from people in Canada on the terms of reference of its study, which will be released in summer 2025. (Sam Samson/CBC) However, in a post on X , formerly known as Twitter, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne suggested that the Competition Bureau's market study be \"refined to focus on domestic passenger airline services rather than airport governance.\" The study's terms of reference would have to be approved by the minister, and in draft form say they will not evaluate airport governance except where it relates to competition for Canadian passenger services. Regulator using new powers The market study, which was first announced May 9, is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December Q & A: WestJet CEO Alexis von Hoensbroech talks air travel costs and new reduced-fare category WestJet planning new fare category for travellers willing to forgo carry-on bag \"One of the important changes to our law, and it's something we've advocated for for quite some time, was the ability to compel information rather than just companies providing it to us voluntarily,\" said Durocher. \"Whether we're going to do it for this first study, I think remains to be determined.\" He expects the Competition Bureau will make that decision after the market study officially launches in the coming months. WATCH | Will Swoop and Sunwing's demise mean higher airfares? No Swoop, no Sunwing, no flight deals? WestJet's CEO weighs in 11 months ago Duration 2:01 With discount airlines Swoop and Sunwing being absorbed into WestJet, some fear the reduced competition will mean higher overall airfares. WestJet's CEO says it won't. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. In a statement emailed to CBC News, Westjet said, \"Air travel is essential to our country and we welcome interest from all groups,\" with regard to this study. Air Canada said it could not comment directly on today's announcement, as they are reviewing the draft.",

        "description": "The 55th annual World Series of Poker begins Tuesday at Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas, with 99 live bracelet events and 30 online events scheduled.",
        "content": "It’s tough to top a good poker rivalry, and two of the game’s bright young stars will go head-to-head all summer long at the World Series of Poker starting Tuesday. Jeremy Becker and Landon Tice are involved in a crossbook bet that will see the players compare their results at the end of the series. The one with the most money earned will win an additional sum. But this is also a battle between poker giants Daniel Negreanu and Matt Berkey. Negreanu has a staking deal with Becker, and it was his post on X listing potential WSOP matchups that started the wheels in motion on the bet. When Tice saw the post suggesting he and Becker would be a good pairing, Tice responded about an hour later suggesting a crossbook. Tice is backed by Berkey, and the terms of the bet were agreed on quickly. May also do a WSOP matchups freeroll and give people a chance to win some money by picking the right matchups. A few off the top of my head: @JonathanLittle @berkey11 @Jbex2417 @LandonTice @krissyb24poker @MariaHo Chidwick @Sdavies22 @luckychewy @NickSchulman ... — Daniel Negreanu (@RealKidPoker) February 16, 2024 Plenty of side action also has come in, with many of the biggest names in poker eager to take Becker or Tice. “We both got what we wanted,” Tice told WorldPokerTour.com in April. Here are five more things to watch this summer at the WSOP, which takes place at Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas: 1. Main Event growth The $10,000 buy-in No-limit Hold’em World Championship drew a record field last year, topping 10,000 entrants for the first time. Will there be another surge, or was that the ceiling? The WSOP and online poker sites are running promotions and satellites for entries to the Main Event, which begins July 3 . And poker continues to see a spike in popularity globally, meaning another record is not out of the question. “Poker continues to grow organically throughout the world,” WSOP vice president Jack Effel said. “We’re expecting a record turnout. We’re planning for bigger than ever. We’re planning for better than ever.” 2. Lower buy-ins One of the most notable changes at the WSOP in recent years is the proliferation of more affordable tournaments on the schedule, such as the $300 buy-in Gladiators of Poker No-limit Hold’em. Whether it’s the $500 buy-in WSOP Kickoff No-limit Hold’em Freezeout that starts Wednesday or the $777 buy-in Lucky 7’s No-limit Hold’em the final week, there are tournaments running all summer that cost less than a ticket to an Adele show at Caesars Palace. For those with a more modest bankroll, there are five tournaments from June 25 to July 3 ranging in buy-ins from $400 (Colossus No-limit Hold’em) to $800 (Independence Day Celebration No-limit Hold’em). 3. Negreanu’s slump While many of Negreanu’s contemporaries continue to earn gold bracelets for WSOP victories, the popular pro remains stuck on six for his career. Is this the summer the Las Vegas resident finally ends the drought? Negreanu has had success on the PokerGO Tour recently, including a victory at the Pot-limit Omaha series in March for $147,500 after a first-place finish in January. But his last bracelet came at the 2013 WSOP Europe, and he hasn’t won an event at the WSOP in Las Vegas since 2008. Expect Negreanu to play a lighter schedule than usual. If he makes a final table, expect a large crowd at the Horseshoe to see if he can finally bring No. 7 home. 4. What’s in the box? No format has gained more popularity in recent years than bounty tournaments, which give players the chance to win large prizes for knocking out an opponent without needing to make the final table. This year has no less than seven on the schedule and is highlighted by the return of the $1,000 buy-in Mystery Millions No-limit Hold’em event with a guaranteed $1 million for the top bounty. The $1,000 buy-in Mystery Bounty Pot-limit Omaha tournament is a new addition. Other bounty events of note include the $10,000 buy-in Mystery Bounty No-limit Hold’em and the $10,000 buy-in Super Turbo Bounty No-limit Hold’em Freezeout. 5. Online bracelets After announcing it was combining the online player pools in Nevada, Michigan and New Jersey into one network, the WSOP Online bracelet event schedule was released Saturday. There are 30 tournaments starting Saturday, including five high rollers. There will be gold bracelets up for grabs every Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday of the series with the $10,000 buy-in WSOP Online Championship main event set for July 11. The new WSOP software allows for Pot-limit Omaha events, multitabling, mystery bounty tournaments and multi-flight re-entry events. Contact David Schoen at dschoen@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5203.

        "description": "Arne Slot is already getting plans in place ahead of his first transfer window as Liverpool boss but club scouts already appear to have altered the Reds’ first move of the summer",
        "content": "Liverpool are set to make a move for Atalanta midfielder Ederson after being left impressed when scouting another star. The Reds are heading into their first summer under the control of Arne Slot this year and could do with midfield recruits following the exit of Thiago Alcantara . Slot’s compatriot Teun Koopmeiners was previously thought to be among their targets this summer, but plans appear to have changed following a scouting mission in Italy. According to Tuttosport , the Reds watched the Dutch midfielder in action for Atalanta. While they were there, they noticed one of his teammates, Ederson. It is reported that they were left impressed by his performance and are ‘now planning an attack’ for his signature. Ederson, 24, is a Brazilian international. He joined Atalanta from Salernitana in July 2022. The defensive midfielder has gone on to make 89 appearances in all competitions since and helped the Italian side to the Europa League title this season. Transfer news live - Chelsea in 'advanced' Maresca talks, Man Utd deal confirmed Ex-Liverpool ace Philippe Coutinho in 'advanced talks' to rejoin old club Ederson has three years left on his contract with Atalanta. Should Liverpool make a move, it could see the Reds end their interest in Koopmeiners. The Dutchman has been linked with a move to Anfield in the past. Serie A side Juventus are also credited with an interest and could swoop should they face little competition. Koopmeiners’ agent has admitted that interest in his client is only natural given his form. Speaking to CalcioMercato, Bart Baving said: \"Let's see. Liverpool are interested Ederson after scouting Teun Koopmeiners ( Image: Getty Images) Who should Liverpool sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below “Teun is having a fantastic season, he has scored many beautiful and important goals, moreover he is a footballer with a constant performance, so it would be strange if other clubs didn't follow him. \"We know how football works. For now he is very happy to have won the Europa League with Atalanta, and he will focus on finishing Serie A well, given that Atalanta can still finish third and then on the European Championship. That's all I can say for now.\" Meanwhile, Koopmeiners failed to rule out a summer transfer away from Atalanta. “I’m only happy to enjoy this title with the fans, I’m focused on celebrating,” he told told Sky Italia after winning the Europa League. “Next season? I don’t know. We will see.” While the Reds are keen to add to their midfield ahead of next season, they might also be forced into the market for a new winger. Colombian winger Luis Diaz has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Barcelona. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The arrested persons include the parents and the baby boy has been rescued. The case was registered on Sunday night and further investigation is underway. The accused include the child’s mother (Najmeen Shaikh), his father (Mohammad Shaikh), the agents (Sakinabanno Shaikh, Rabia and Saiba Ansari), besides the gay man, Inder Mehrwal. The DN Nagar police said that Najmeen, a resident of Malvani, filed a complaint about her son being sold. As per the complaint, her neighbour offered her Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per day for a “baby role” in the film industry. When she approached the Ansaris, they gave her Rs10,000 but didn’t return the child and said he had been sold. Senior police inspector Rajender Machchindra said the probe revealed involvement of the gay man and that the parents themselves had sold the child. On interrogation, Najmeen confessed and said she approached the cops as she was missing her son. However, her husband had spent the money within a day.",

        "description": "Construction at Echo Amphitheater will add campsite electric hookups and a water fill station, among other improvements.",
        "content": "Echo Amphitheater, a natural amphitheater near Abiquiú, is getting a much-needed makeover. The popular attraction off U.S. 84 has a picnic shelter, an eight-site campground and a short trail to the towering, half-round amphitheater where everyday visitors, musicians and yodelers have been known to delight in creating echoes. The area closed earlier this month for six months of construction to address deferred maintenance and add new features such as electric hookups at every campsite — improvements intended to usher in “a new era\" for the recreation area, Carson National Forest District Ranger Angie Krall wrote in a news release. “The big picture for us is really improving the visitor experience,” Carson National Forest spokesman Zach Behrens said. “Things were becoming dilapidated and less welcoming; they’d lost their shine. ... The bathrooms just plain stopped working,” he added. Two bathrooms at the site were already replaced during a first phase of construction last year. In the ongoing second phase, estimated to cost $688,000, the Albuquerque-based contractor Construction Technology & Management will improve the road; replace campfire rings, picnic tables and an informational kiosk; install new fencing to prevent people from hiking off trail; and add a potable water fill station. Improvements will also mitigate flooding of the campgrounds, which has been a problem during monsoon season, Behrens said. Both phases of construction have been funded through the Legacy Restoration Fund established by the Great American Outdoors Act, which was signed into law by former President Donald Trump in 2020. The legislation represented a “major investment” in federal outdoor management agencies to target deferred maintenance projects, Behrens said. The Great American Outdoors Act allocated 15% of the total maintenance funds, or $285 million per year through the upcoming fiscal year 2025, to the Forest Service. In Carson National Forest, that money will fund improvements to Canjilon Lakes campground and day use areas, El Rito Campground and La Bobita Campground, in addition to Echo Amphitheater. Fees to visit Echo Amphitheater also increased this year to fund continued maintenance of the site, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The fee for day use increased from $2 to $5, while camping fees increased from a range of $10 to $40 to $20 to $50, depending on the site. All campsites are currently first come, first served, but Forest Service leaders plan to enable online reservations for the group shelter in the future, Behrens said.",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "description": "Ingrid Lane, 37, has not been seen since apparently setting out for a solo hike near San Antonio Mountain in October.",
        "content": "Ingrid Lane always loved to hike. Despite her chronic health problems, she treasured spending time in nature, said her mother, Rebecca Lane. Family and friends believe that's what 37-year-old Ingrid Lane was doing in October when she disappeared after heading out alone for a hike in the Jemez Mountains. She was last seen in Jemez Springs, where she had visited the Bodhi Manda Zen Center. \"Sadly, in my heart of hearts, I think she got lost hiking,\" Rebecca Lane said. \"She'd had COVID, she had impaired lungs, her car was left at 9,100 feet elevation. I think she just got lost somewhere and she's somewhere in the wilderness and has passed away.\" Law enforcement and volunteers' efforts to find Ingrid Lane came up empty in the days and weeks after she went missing last fall. Searchers focused mainly around the remote site where her car was found off Forest Road 144 near San Antonio Mountain, just west of the Valles Caldera National Preserve. More than 80 search and rescue volunteers renewed the hunt recently, Rebecca Lane said, also without success. She had driven to New Mexico from Oregon with her sister to be present during the search. \"They used it as a training session,\" she said. \"But boy, did they put effort in.\" Ingrid Lane, an Albuquerque resident and St. John's College graduate, had struggled for years with mental health issues, her family members and friends said, though it remains unclear whether that played a role in her disappearance. As months continue to drag by, her loved ones say they're still hopeful she will be found, bringing closure, but most have lost hope she will be found alive. “She was a very intelligent person, a very kind person, [who] really did care about a lot of things,\" said Emma Mincks, a childhood friend who reconnected with Lane in recent years when they both moved to New Mexico. “... Just because someone has mental health issues or mental struggles doesn’t mean that you shouldn't keep looking for them.” Lane had a recent breakdown, Mincks said. “I was thinking she probably went camping with the intention of not coming back, honestly. ... [But] I’m very concerned that she could be still alive and waiting for people to help her.\" Lane was dogged by health issues since birth. A twin who was born nearly three months premature, she was hospitalized for six months as an infant and had a condition called bronchopulmonary dysplasia. At one point, she was told she would need a lung transplant by age 30, said Rebecca Lane, 71, who lives in Albany, Ore. Cognitively, Ingrid Lane was ahead of the curve. She initially attended Johns Hopkins University in Maryland before taking some time off and transferring to St. John's College in Santa Fe. She later attended by turns the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, the University of South Dakota and, most recently, the University of New Mexico, where she studied biomedical engineering. \"She kind of likes to take the scenic route on things,\" Rebecca Lane said. Ingrid Lane was also a musician with a deeply spiritual side, who during her time at St. John's spent a significant amount of time at the Bodhi Manda Zen Center in Jemez Springs, and even considered monastic life for a time, Mincks said. Mincks said Lane was open about her mental health issues when the two started hiking together regularly in 2020 during the pandemic. “She was definitely, like, thinking that she would die from COVID possibly if she got it because of her lungs, but she also was pretty positive about it, too,\" Mincks said. \"It was a little confusing for me.\" Mincks said Lane seemed to become more grounded after she met Louis Scuderi, a fellow musician who shared Lane's love of science and math, and of cats. The pair started dating and eventually got married. Scuderi did not respond to requests for an interview. Mincks said Lane seemed happy and excited about the relationship. But she said she also could see mental health issues were taking a toll on her friend. Lane told Mincks she was having trouble at her job at Sandia National Laboratories, and, among other frustrations, said she didn't feel the initiatives she wanted to work on there were well received. Lane eventually left that position and started pursuing another role at an organization associated with Los Alamos National Laboratory, Rebecca Lane said. Ingrid Lane experienced what her mother and Mincks called \"a breakdown\" last year, a few weeks before her disappearance. Scuderi later told police his wife had expressed suicidal thoughts, and had been picking up hitchhikers and driving them around town, according to a Sandoval County Sheriff's Office report. Lane also contracted COVID-19 twice last summer. Mincks said thoughts of death seemed to be frequently on her friend's mind. “She had been talking to me about how she was worried she would be a burden on Louis,\" Mincks said. \"She was like ... 'I'm not pulling my weight.' \" But in October, Mincks said, she got together with Lane while Lane's mother was in town and noticed her friend seemed to be in a better place. \"She seemed very calm and not upset about the Sandia stuff anymore,\" Mincks said. In mid-October, Ingrid Lane headed up to Jemez Springs to spend the night at the Bodhi Manda Zen Center. Hosen Christiane Ranger, the center's abbess and director, said she knew Lane fairly well, thanks to Lane's history with the center. \"She was a beautiful being,\" Ranger said, adding it wasn't unusual for Lane to visit every so often. Lane departed from the center the morning of Oct. 15, telling Ranger she had to go to both Albuquerque and Los Alamos that day, and also mentioning she wanted to go for a hike. Lt. John Castañeda, a spokesman for the Sandoval County Sheriff’s Office, said the agency was notified of Lane's disappearance Oct. 19, although Scuderi initially reported her missing a day earlier. Scuderi told local media outlets last year he got concerned about his wife after a couple of days of not hearing from her. He said he contacted the zen center Oct. 18, a Wednesday, and learned she had been gone since the previous Sunday. Following the coordinates of an Apple Air Tag Lane had with her, sheriff's deputies found her 2019 black Subaru Impreza on Forest Road 144 about 11 miles off N.M. 126, initial reports said. \"They found it broken down, abandoned, with a broken rear window,\" Castañeda said. A \"big boulder rock\" was sitting in the back-right passenger seat and shattered glass was all over the inside of the car, a report said — but Lane was nowhere to be seen. It's a remote area deep in the Jemez Mountains, Castañeda said, with not much around. \"It's just trees,\" he said. Rebecca Lane said her daughter's AllTrails account showed she'd last downloaded directions for a trail on San Antonio Mountain. A deputy wrote in one report he used his public address system to see if Lane was nearby. \"I searched the area when I did not hear any sounds coming from the immediate area of where Ingrid's car was located,\" the deputy wrote. More law enforcement arrived at the scene, and one deputy used his dog to try to track Lane, without success. Later, the La Cueva Volunteer Fire Department showed up to try to help, a report said. \"It was difficult to try to find her due to the sun going down,\" the report said. The next day, while search and rescue teams continued the efforts, detectives processed Lane's car, which they noted had \"no signs of foul play.\" Three laptops were in the car, along with cash and a journal. Castañeda said later some hunters reported seeing Lane walking up the road on the same day she went missing. The search for Ingrid Lane paused over the winter months, as snow blanketed the area, Rebecca Lane said. The recent search efforts were made as part of a training exercise for search and rescue teams from Taos, Los Alamos, Santa Fe and Cibola counties, said Bob Rodgers, the New Mexico Search and Rescue resource officer for the state Department of Public Safety. \"We covered a very large area,\" Rodgers said of the search, spread over roughly six square miles of forest around the area where Ingrid Lane went missing. Search dogs, drones, \"ground-pounders\" and even a fixed-wing Civil Air Patrol plane combed the area. “The reason we did this as an exercise is because based on the time period, we could pretty much assume that the subject we’re looking for is deceased,\" Rodgers said. Rebecca Lane said she hopes hikers who frequent that area will keep their eyes out for any sign of her daughter, particularly in the area around Forest Road 376, which she said has not been searched as much and which runs parallel to Forest Road 144. She's grateful for the work of the volunteers, she said, but she's been frustrated by local law enforcement's response, handled mostly by the Sandoval County Sheriff's Office. She doesn't think a crime against her daughter was likely, Rebecca Lane said, but there have been a couple of odd occurrences during the search that have kept her wondering — an item belonging to her daughter showing up on a roadway a couple of days into the search, for example, when nobody remembered seeing it there before. She said she wishes the sheriff's office had been more involved. \"They have not really done anything to gather initial information,\" she said. \"Like, they didn't even do forensics on the car. ... They just really put no effort, even the token amount.\" The sheriff's office didn't respond to a question about Rebecca Lane's concerns. She said she and other family members are devastated by her daughter's disappearance and are trying to move forward. But it's hard without closure. “I’m functioning,\" she said. \"But there's this huge, unfillable hole in my life.”",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. People are also reading... Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "description": "Analysts at Bell Potter think this could be a great option for investors with a high risk tolerance.The post This disruptive speculative ASX stock could rise 75% in 12 months appeared first on The Motley Fool Australia.",
        "content": "If you have a high tolerance for , then it could be worth thinking about adding the ASX stock in this article to a balanced portfolio. The stock in question is ( ). What is IperionX? IperionX is aiming to become a leading American titanium metal and critical materials company. It is using patented metal technologies to produce high performance titanium alloys from titanium minerals or scrap titanium. This is achieved with lower energy, low costs and low carbon emissions. The company notes that its Titan critical minerals project is the largest JORC-compliant mineral resource of titanium, rare earth, and zircon minerals sands in the United States. This leaves it well positioned to benefit from demand for titanium metal and critical minerals for advanced U.S. industries. This includes space, aerospace, defence, consumer electronics, hydrogen, electric vehicles, and additive manufacturing. Why is this a speculative ASX stock to buy? According to a note out of Bell Potter, its analysts think this ASX stock could be seriously undervalued at current levels. The note reveals that the broker has reaffirmed its speculative buy rating with an improved price target of $3.85. Based on its current share price of $2.19, this implies potential upside of 76% for investors over the next 12 months. To put that into context, a $10,000 investment would be worth approximately $17,600 by this time next year if Bell Potter is on the money with its recommendation. Though, it is worth acknowledging that its speculative rating means that there's potential for sizeable losses as well. That's why this ASX stock is likely to be only suitable for investors that have a much higher than average risk tolerance. What is the broker saying? Bell Potter believes that the company has the potential to disrupt the titanium supply chain with its technology. It explains: IPX has the potential to disrupt the incumbent titanium supply chain through materially lowering production costs and manufacturing waste. Large-scale production will commence this year, further de-risking the company's technologies and enabling IPX to progress commercial relationships with several high-profile aerospace, automotive, luxury goods and government end users. Our valuation is mostly supported by Phase 2 earnings using relatively conservative assumptions with respect to process margins. There is potential for IPX to rapidly scale Phase 2 and cement itself as a key supplier in the US and global titanium value chains. Our IPX valuation is now $3.85/sh (previously $3.70/sh), having removed the assumption of a near-term equity raise and its corresponding dilution. All in all, the broker believes IperionX could have a very bright future ahead of it. This could make it one to watch very closely.",

        "description": "Several in Santa Fe received new designations, slipping from \"traditional\" status to needing some level of state aid to improve.",
        "content": "The state Public Education Department last week unveiled an updated version of its online portal for statewide school statistics, called New Mexico Vistas. The revamped site's data from the 2022-23 school year didn't change, but many school designations were shuffled, altering the level of state support schools will be set to receive. Twelve public schools in Santa Fe received new designations, with several schools slipping from \"traditional\" status, or requiring no state intervention, to needing some level of state aid to improve. Why the sudden change in status? The Public Education Department \"needed to revise its accountability calculations\" after receiving nearly 300 appeals from districts and charter schools pointing out flawed data, the department's Research, Evaluation and Accountability Division stated in a document explaining the changes. \"The current (revised) designations for [school year] 2022–23 are correct,\" the document says. \"However, the PED recognizes that its work must be viewed as a process of continuous improvement and will continue to refine its processes in the accountability cycles ahead.\" For Santa Fe Public Schools, the data is another push to improve student outcomes, Superintendent Hilario \"Larry\" Chavez wrote in a message to The New Mexican . \"We have seen positive movement, however, we are not content,\" Chavez wrote. \"Our goal is to continue to improve each and every year.\" School officials have long voiced concerns about the accuracy of the data and designations included in the Public Education Department's Vistas system. Agency records obtained by The New Mexican show several school districts — including Santa Fe Public Schools, Rio Rancho Public Schools, and Gallup-McKinley County Schools — filed appeals indicating errors in 2021-22 proficiency data. In one appeal to the Public Education Department, Beata Thorstensen, the Santa Fe district's chief of assessment and accountability, wrote, “All math and science proficiency data appear to have been scrambled for ALL schools. ... This appears to also have impacted school designations, removing underperforming schools from our list. This is a critical issue that requires immediate remedy.” The revised Vistas designations resulted in a dip in classifications and additional state resources for several local schools. Originally, Amy Biehl, Aspen and Gonzales community schools, Ortiz Middle School and Ramirez Thomas Elementary School were categorized as \"traditional\" schools. Now, all five are labeled for \"additional targeted support and improvement,\" meaning they serve one or more student subgroups performing in the lowest 5% of all public schools in the state. El Camino Real Academy and Salazar Elementary School dropped from the additional targeted support level to \"comprehensive support,\" or schools in the bottom 5% of low-income schools overall. It's not all bad news, though. Four local schools improved their scores in the latest revision, with Santa Fe High School and Nina Otero Community School achieving \"traditional\" status. Desert Sage Academy moved from “comprehensive support school” to the second-lowest \"additional targeted support\" rung. The award for most improved player unquestionably goes to Early College Opportunities High School, which earned \"spotlight\" status — putting it among the top 25% of New Mexico schools for the first time. The honor comes as the school enjoys a newly constructed campus on Zia Road. The revisions also allowed the education department to update New Mexico Vistas' user interface. Several educators connected to Teach Plus New Mexico — the local affiliate of a nationwide advocacy and leadership development organization for teachers — offered their feedback. The group urged the department to expand comparison options across schools, districts and the state, and to improve user-friendliness across the site, Teach Plus New Mexico Executive Director Hope Morales said in a statement. \"The revisions made to NMVistas will serve to facilitate a deeper understanding of school performance among families and other stakeholders, fostering collaborative efforts toward statewide system improvements,\" she said.",

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "content": "Parents' nightmare after doctor mistook rare bruise condition for abuse and called in social workers to take away daughter Robyn Parker-Briggs suffers from a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome By Chris Brooke and Victoria Williams Published: 21:44, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:45, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A couple were told to hand over their children to social services after a doctor mistook their baby daughter's bruise for a sign of abuse during a 'three-minute consultation'. Little Robyn Parker-Briggs suffers from an extremely rare condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which causes her fragile skin to bruise and burst open at the slightest touch. The two-year-old has been in and out of hospital since birth and has been cared for by devoted parents Louise Parker and Mark Briggs, who have given up work to look after her. But the parents were thrown into a nightmare lasting three months when they were reported to social services after a routine hospital visit. Ms Parker, 39, said the doctor, who had been called in to examine Robyn by a fellow medic, looked at the bruising and slight swelling behind her ear and stated: 'We are getting social services involved.' Robyn was nine months old at the time. Ms Parker, from South Shields, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I always carry Robyn's extensive medical notes with me, but the doctor wasn't interested in looking at them. Louise Parker (right) was ordered to hand over her children to social services after a doctor wrongly accused her of abusing her poorly daughter Robyn Parker-Briggs (left) Robyn suffers from an extremely rare condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which causes her fragile skin to bruise and burst open at the slightest touch 'The doctor made a snap decision that changed our lives for ever.' The property sales adviser along with Mr Briggs, 43, a warehouse worker, refused to hand over Robyn and her brother Mason, then aged three. But they were forbidden from being alone with their children and had to move in with relatives. South Tyneside Council only dropped the case when Robyn was given a diagnosis of EDS by specialists. The toddler's variant is so rare and extreme that medics are still learning how to deal with it, and she cannot even wear shoes for fear of damaging her feet. Ms Parker said: 'All the doctors who had treated Robyn since birth and knew our family understood how wrong this was. They tried their best to stop this happening. They pushed for extra tests...to get answers we all hoped would end this nightmare.' The ordeal began in July 2022 after Ms Parker noticed swelling behind her daughter's ear, and feared she may have been stung by an insect. She took her to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where Robyn had been treated since birth but had not received a formal EDS diagnosis. The parents were thrown into a nightmare lasting three months when they were reported to social services after a routine hospital visit They were discharged after four days of tests and scans to check for signs of abuse, but they could not return home alone. At that point a social worker told them to hand over the children until the conclusion of court proceedings. The couple refused and fought the demand, though they were warned against this. Ms Parker said: 'There was no chance I was going to allow them to take away my children. Not even for a day.' The family was subjected to detailed checks until the ordeal was ended by the formal diagnosis. Ms Parker said: 'You'd imagine I would feel a sense of relief, but I don't. I feel angry and traumatised.' Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the distress this family has experienced. If they would like to raise any issues about their child's care, we would encourage them to get in touch.' South Tyneside Council added: 'We appreciate the distress such proceedings may cause any family but take our safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously.'

        "content": "Academics, activists and Indigenous people gathered Monday in the Brazilian Amazon to weigh in on a key legal question: What responsibility do states have in the face of climate emergencies? The matter is one before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which was invited to Brazil to hold public hearings in a case that has drawn input from around the world. The Brazilian Amazon, home to the world’s largest rainforest, is a “region of indisputable importance” when facing the effects of climate change, said the president of the Costa Rica-based court, Nancy Hernandez Lopez, at the opening of the session. The case was brought in January 2023 by Chile and Colombia, who have asked the court for an advisory opinion on a country’s duties when “responding to the climate emergency under the framework of international human rights law.” “We ask the court to consider states’ obligations to Indigenous peoples,” said Junior Anderson Guarani Kaiowa, from Brazil’s second-largest Indigenous community. He said the region where his people live in Mato Grosso do Sul “is threatened by desertification, with no forest, no water, and no animals,” he said. “In Guarani Kaiowa cosmology, the river and the forests maintain the balance of global warming. Pray that rivers contaminated with pesticides do not dry up later.” The hearings are taking place from Monday to Wednesday in Manaus, the capital of Brazil’s Amazonas state. The first hearings in the case took place in Barbados in April, before they moved to Brasilia last week. Hernandez Lopez said the court had received more than 260 written contributions from civil society organizations around the world, “the largest participation in the history” of the court. The advisory opinion is expected by the end of the year, a court source told AFP. At the hearing in Brasilia, teenagers and activists from several South American countries warned that climate change affects young people “differently” with consequences for health, education, nutrition and hobbies. Brazil has been hard-hit by extreme weather events attributed to climate change, the most recent of which are the historic floods in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul that have left nearly 170 people dead and dozens missing.

        "content": "Pope Francis shocks bishops by allegedly saying gay men should not be admitted to church seminaries because 'there's already too much f*****ry' Bishops told Italian media the comments were met with 'incredulous laughter' By Elena Salvoni Published: 21:40, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:44, 27 May 2024 e-mail 4 View comments Pope Francis has allegedly shocked bishops in Italy by using an offensive slur when saying that homosexual men should not be admitted to church seminaries because there is already 'too much' gay sexual activity. The pontiff told an episcopal conference at the Vatican that homosexual men should not be allowed into colleges to train for the priesthood, Italian media reports. Bishops at the meeting were reportedly taken aback by the language he used to make this statement - the derogatory word 'frociaggine', which roughly translates to f*****ry. The remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera. They suggested that it was an honest mistake by the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he did not know how offensive the word was. The alleged comments, which seem to go against recent moves to amend seminary admission rules, have come as a surprise to some in the church as Francis is known for taking a more liberal view than his predecessors on LGBT rights. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past When asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?' Last year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church. The reports about the closed-door meeting on May 20 come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere. The paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.' This, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.' However, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.' Francis' latest remarks suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether. The Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion. The comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference The 2005 Vatican document, which was endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called \"gay culture.\"' There is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past. He has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support. It widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "description": "Notre Dame pummeled Maryland, 15-5, in Philadelphia to win its second straight NCAA Division I men's lacrosse national championship.",
        "content": "PHILADELPHIA — Charged with trying to derail the juggernaut in men’s lacrosse this spring, Maryland’s bid to play roadblock devolved into being more of a speed bump. Defying a scheduled start delayed by inclement weather, the No. 7 seed Terps raced to an early two-goal lead but couldn’t keep up with top-seeded Notre Dame, which confirmed its reputation as the season’s most imposing team and captured its second consecutive national championship with a 15-5 thrashing in the NCAA Tournament final Monday afternoon before an announced 31,479 at Lincoln Financial Field. The crowd was the largest for the title game since 2019 when 31,528 watched Virginia outlast Yale, 13-9, also at Lincoln Financial Field. The attendance for the three-day championship weekend was 80,898. Senior midfielder Eric Malever totaled one goal and two assists, but Maryland (11-6) fell well short of its first NCAA title since 2022 and fifth overall. The program dropped to 4-13 in the tournament final overall and 2-6 under coach John Tillman. The Fighting Irish (16-1) wrapped up their season on a 14-game winning streak that began with a 14-9 victory over the Terps on March 3. Notre Dame, which had not lost since Feb. 25 when Georgetown pulled off an 11-10 overtime stunner in South Bend, Indiana, became the seventh team to repeat as national champions, joining Johns Hopkins in 1978-79 and 1984-85, Syracuse in 1988-89 and 2008-09, Princeton in 1996-98 and Duke in 2013-14. Senior attackman Chris Kavanagh scored five goals and graduate student attackman and older brother Pat forged a game-high six points, all on assists, for Notre Dame, which scored at least 10 goals in every contest this spring. Pat Kavanagh broke the school’s NCAA Tournament single-game record for assists while Chris tied the mark in goals. Despite a 17-for-24, six-ground ball performance by graduate student faceoff specialist Luke Wierman, Maryland had few remedies for Notre Dame’s relentless play in seemingly every facet. The Terps scored the fewest goals in a title game since 2015 when they dropped a 10-5 decision to Denver, committed 11 of their 16 turnovers by midway through the second quarter, went almost 20 minutes in the first half without a goal, and didn’t get a save from graduate student goalkeeper Logan McNaney until 93 seconds had elapsed in the third quarter. Although McNaney stopped 10 shots, his early struggles were a drastic departure from his Fighting Irish counterpart Liam Entenmann, the graduate student who rebounded from giving up two quick goals to finish with 16 saves. And as effective as the Kavanagh brothers were, the offense got a significant lift from its second midfield of sophomore Max Busenkell (one goal and two assists), junior Will Angrick (one goal and one assist) and graduate student Reilly Gray (one goal). Those contributions, as well as goals from juniors Jalen Seymour and Fisher Finley of the third midfield line, propelled Notre Dame despite appearing to mirror a long weather delay that pushed the game’s start time from noon to 2:10 p.m. The time had been adjusted Sunday afternoon from its original schedule of 1 p.m. in anticipation of severe thunderstorms and lightning. The delay did not seem to affect Maryland, which got a goal from senior midfielder Ryan Siracusa off a pass by Malever just 34 seconds into the game. Siracusa returned the favor by giving the ball to senior attackman Daniel Kelly (Calvert Hall) for a rip from the high slot that extended the team’s lead to 2-0 less than four minutes in. Notre Dame shook off any lethargy when Angrick collected a feed from Busenkell and scored from the slot a minute later. And less than a minute after that, the Fighting Irish pounced on a breakdown by the Terps defense that left graduate student attackman Jake Taylor wide-open in the slot to receive a pass from Pat Kavanagh and score. Busenkell gave Notre Dame its first lead of the afternoon with a well-placed shot from a sharp angle left of the cage to the top right corner of the net midway through the high-scoring first frame. But Maryland evened the score at 3 just 11 seconds later when senior midfielder Jack Koras caught a pass from graduate student attackman Daniel Maltz and fired a jump shot from the left point. That’s when the Fighting Irish imposed its will. They scored seven straight goals over a 17:40 stretch bridging the first two quarters. The run included three consecutive goals by Chris Kavanagh and three assists by Pat Kavanagh. Malever ended a 19:51 Terps scoring drought when he converted a skip pass by Koras for an extra-man goal with 1:15 left in the second quarter. Even that tally had to withstand a challenge by Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan that was eventually denied by officials before Maryland players and fans could release a sigh of relief. Armed with a 10-4 lead, the Fighting Irish opened the third quarter with three straight goals — including two by Chris Kavanagh — to extinguish any hopes of a Terps comeback.

The gunfight , which happened on May 13 around 5 p.m. near Barton Street East and Kinrade Avenue, was featured in a press conference last week highlighting an uptick in gun violence across the city. Chief Frank Bergen characterized the recent spate of brazen daytime gunfights as “alarming” and “not acceptable.” The footage showed a youngster walking down an alleyway moments before two men and a driver exchanged fire. “If that’s not alarming, then I don’t know what it is,” Bergen commented. “Moments before these punks thought it was a good idea to target another gangster, ... you saw a five-year-old walking down that alleyway coming home from school.” Story continues below advertisement The Nissan sedan involved struck two other vehicles before the driver jumped out and fled down Gibson Avenue.

        "content": "Tommy Chong may be the OG of potheads, but these days the 86-year-old gets his cannabis from edibles. “I was never a heavy smoker,” said the Edmonton-born Chong, in town to collect a cannabis industry award at the Grow Up Conference and Expo taking place from Monday to Wednesday at the Delta By Marriott Toronto Airport Convention Centre. “The (Cheech and Chong) movies (of the 1970s and onward) showed me with a big, old joint, but there was no inhaling.” In fact, Chong’s more recent time behind bars lead to him quitting smoking weed entirely. “When I got in trouble with the law (for selling bongs online), I had to quit smoking — it’s called pretrial probation — and then I did nine months in jail (between 2003 and 2004) and then I was on probation for a year after that, so I did three years without any cannabis.” Following that, Chong battled both prostate and rectal cancer. “I’m a medical miracle,” said Chong. I asked him: What, then, contributes to his longevity? “My gorgeous wife,” he joked. “I stay in shape chasing after her.” More seriously, he said: “I got into bodybuilding in the ’50s. And I’ve been an avid bodybuilder, still am, all my life. And that included diet, that included lifestyle. So in spite of my movies, I’m really a boring, healthy guy.” Chong is the curator for Tommy’s Craft, a cannabis brand run by family members that is sold in Alberta, Manitoba and Newfoundland, and he is getting the Tommy Chong’s Legends of Cannabis Award at the Grow Up Conference. “It’s a ticket that says I don’t have to go to jail,” he joked. Chong, who claims not to know much about the laws surrounding the 2018 Canadian legalization of recreational cannabis, is nonetheless thrilled it happened. “That phrase it took too long, it doesn’t work,” he said. “Cause we’re only in the now. Right now, we’re in a nice position.” And he’s not surprised that a recent Canadian report said 30% of people in our country still get their pot from their dealer instead of government stores. “Of course!” said Chong. “You don’t need this expensive packaging that keeps kids — and old guys like me — from opening it.” Chong feels similarly about a 2022 study published in the New York Times , saying more Americans imbibe in cannabis daily than alcohol. “It makes me feel good,” he said, adding: “I’m 86 years old. I can still dance. I can still play golf. I can still do lots of things and a lot of it has to do with my involvement with the cannabis plant. ” Chong, who teamed up with Mexican-American Cheech Marin in Vancouver in the early ’70s to form the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, most recently toured across Canada with his old partner in 2019 until Marin’s “knees gave out. “We had a nice time,” said Chong, who is planning on touring again with wife and Vancouver native Shelby Fiddis. “Cheech loves Canada. Well, you know, he was a landed immigrant during the Vietnam War.” Still, a new documentary about the comedy team called Cheech and Chong’s Last Movie is coming from his daughter Robbi Chong and producer Dave Bushell ( Sling Blade , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. ) “It’s looking for a home,” said Chong. “Right now, we’re trying to figure out how to distribute it.”",

        "content": "BARTOW, Fla. (WFLA) — This historic mansion in Polk County is said to be a tribute to a man who constructed the home without any blueprints. The Wonder House was considered a popular tourist destination and attraction from the 1930s to the 1960s. The four-story gem was built by Conrad Schuck, from Pennsylvania, in 1926. “People come in and appreciate a little bit of history and see a little bit about the architecture around the house. I think that’s the coolest aspect,” Wonder House Manager Krislin Kreis said. The home is now used as a private residence by Kreis, who offers tours to visitors when her schedule allows. “My intention is to be able to do tours, to share the house with people, to share the story of Conrad and his family, to see the architecture and engineering that he was able to put into a home,” she explained. Some of the unique features added by Schuck were laundry systems and air conditioning. “A twenty-one square foot lazy Susan kitchen cabinet, wall panels that you could switch out in the ceilings,” Kreis added. Kreis said she is working on renovating and restoring some of the rooms and the moat that is outside. “It’s very special that we’re able to preserve a piece of our history here in Polk County,” The Wonder House offers guided tours that last about an hour and a half. Admission is $25 for adults and $10 for children. Click here to book.",

        "content": "Megastar Amitabh Bachchan wowed the audience with his on-screen persona and acting prowess in the 1999 Hindi family drama Sooryavansham , evoking every emotion in the process. Aside from the talented ensemble, there was one more star whose strong performance and versatility kept moviegoers captivated during the entire screen time. He is actor Ananda Vardhan , who starred in the EVV Satyanarayana film as Amitabh Bachchan’s son Chhote Thakur Bhanupratap Singh a.k.a. Sonu. Now, after twenty years, are you curious about that young artist's current look? One of the numerous child artists that moviegoers cherish is Ananda Vardhan. The actor made his acting debut with the Telugu film ‘Priyaragalu’ in 1997. Ananda featured in over five Telugu movies prior to her role in ‘Sooryanvansham’. Today, the actor has grown up to become a well-known figure in the Telugu film industry . Interestingly, he is the grandson of famous playback singer PB Srinivas. He started out as a young artist and has since grown into a well-known South star. He is quite active on social media. He played the roles of Bala Hanuman and Valmiki in the ‘Ramayanam’ movie when he was four years old. He made his feature film debut as a child actor in ‘Priyaragalu’ alongside Jagapathi Babu and Soundarya. Notable roles followed in hit films like ‘Manasantha Nuvve’ and ‘Preminchukundam Raa’. In addition to Amitabh Bachchan, he starred with well-known actors Jagapati Babu, Venkatesh, and Nandamuri Balakrishna. He earned a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science & Engineering from CMR College of Engineering & Technology, Hyderabad, Telangana in 2012. In the 1999 family drama ‘Sooryavansham’, Amitabh Bachchan played dual roles. He plays Bhanu Pratap Singh, a strict father who has disagreements with his youngest son Heera, deemed a disappointment due to his lack of education. Despite disapproval, Heera wins the heart of Radha and the two of them overcome obstacles to demonstrate his value. The film explores themes of family, customs, and defying expectations.In addition, Anupam Kher, Kader Khan, Jayasudha, Mukesh Rishi, and Soundrya also starred in the film.",

        "description": "Exclusive: ‘This latest childminder numbers debacle is yet more evidence that the Tories offered a pledge without a delivery plan,’ says Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary",
        "content": "The government’s childcare policy is at risk of failure as figures reveal that a “pitiful” number of childminders have signed up for the government’s grant scheme. Information obtained by The Independent via a freedom of information request shows that 1,627 grants were awarded through the government’s childminder start-up grant initiative between the end of November last year and the end of March – with some 1,837 applications during this period. Meanwhile, the number of childminders has more than halved in the last 10 years, falling from 56,200 in 2013 to 27,900 last year, leaving a huge shortfall in childcare providers. Providers are facing higher costs including insurance, Ofsted fees, food costs and gas and electricity bills while parents are also having their incomes squeezed. Campaigners said the grants of up to £1,200 awarded so far are a “drop in the ocean” in a struggling childcare sector grappling with both a staffing and funding crisis. The childminder start-up grant – £600 for those who register with Ofsted and £1,200 for workers who register with a childminder agency – began last November. Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “This latest childminder numbers debacle is yet more evidence that the Tories offered a pledge without a delivery plan – and families desperately in need of childcare will end up paying the price of broken Conservative promises.” She said Labour will roll out a “reformed childcare and early years system to better support families to access childcare”. The first part of the chancellor’s £4bn extension of free childcare – an attempt to win over voters in the lead-up to the election in July – came into force last month. Under the new policy, eligible working parents of two-year-olds have been told they can claim 15 hours a week of free childcare for 38 weeks per year from April onwards. From September 2025, working parents who have children under the age of five will be able to claim 30 hours of free childcare for 38 weeks per year. Applications will open on 12 May for the second wave of funded childcare But Lucie Stephens, of the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, said there was a “real risk” parents will be hunting for childcare places that “just aren’t there”. Previous research by her organisation and the University of Leeds found almost four in 10 childminders are thinking about quitting the sector in the next year. It comes after The Independent recently revealed that thousands of nurseries had shut their doors amid staffing shortages, sparking fears that the government’s promise to expand free childcare was “doomed to failure”. Helen Donohoe, chief executive of the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (Pacey), said: “With the government themselves admitting they need 40,000 more staff in order to roll out the expansion of the funded entitlement scheme, 1,627 childminders in four months is a small drop in the ocean considering childminders provide 166,000 childcare places.” Concerns have been raised only 1,000 childminders will be left in England by the time we reach 2035 if workers continue to flee the sector at the current rate – a tiny fraction of a total of almost 60,000 when the sector was at its peak. Exclusive polling by the Early Education and Childcare Coalition, shared with The Independent , shows 15 per cent of parents with one-year-olds said childminders were their preferred type of childcare. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the number of childminders who have signed up for the grant scheme is “pitiful” in the context of a crisis-stricken childcare sector. “What is actually needed is a long-term retention strategy and that means adequate investment in the earnings and conditions of workers in the early years sector,” he added. “Without this, we are simply fire-fighting rather than tackling the root cause.” Mr Leitch, whose organisation represents nurseries, pre-schools and registered childminders among others, warned the grant scheme runs the risk of attracting childminders who then do not stay in the sector once that initial incentive has gone. He added: “This is skilled, exhausting and professional work. Given the consistent number of closures of childminders and early years settings overall it is clear this is a sector in crisis. This is the result of systemic neglect from the government in respect to funding and a lack of recognition that childcare is part of the education system. “People leave the early years sector for three prime reasons: being undervalued, particularly by the government, exhausted and underpaid.” Jane Davies, a childminder from Derbyshire, said she was not eligible for the government’s start-up grant due to already working in the sector. “The start-up grants haven’t solved any problems,” she added. “It is not very much. It wouldn’t cover the costs of setting up. Nobody wants to come into the sector anymore.” She explained she is planning on leaving the sector due to struggling to make ends meet and feeling “very overworked” and “undervalued”. The 59-year-old, who has been a childminder for 16 years, said: “You can earn more working in Aldi than you can as a childminder. I’ve just done my tax return and I only earned about £8,000 per year after all the tax and running costs were deducted.” Ms Davies said she knows many childminders who have already left the sector as she hit out at a lack of support from the government and being forced to pay for mandatory courses which were free a few years ago. She warned insurance, registration and Ofsted fees have soared, with food costs and gas and electricity bills shooting up. Her funding struggles have worsened since the first phase of the government’s latest free childcare provision started in April, she added, saying the funding is not enough to cover running costs and three nurseries in her area have gone bankrupt since then. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “This is just one way we’re supporting childminders who stand to benefit the most from our significant boost to government hourly funding rates for the new free hours. “More widely, childminders make up just 11 per cent of childcare providers. We are confident in the strength of the sector to deliver the largest ever expansion to government-funded childcare in England, backed by a nationwide recruitment campaign to boost the workforce across the sector.”",

        "content": "The flight had on board people that were headed to Nigeria from the U.S., and a few other European countries via Istanbul. Less than two hours into the flight, the announcement that unsettled a lot of us was made. ‘‘Is there a medical doctor on board this flight? Any medical doctor on board this flight, please come forward, we have an emergency’’. Immediately, a man stood up and headed to the scene of the ‘‘emergency’’. It was not until a young lady (who seemed to be in her twenties) and another middle-aged lady approached the scene and got hands-on that I realised the man who got to the scene first probably went there to LOOK at what was happening. As the two ladies battled to stabilise the man, some other passengers on the flight began to approach the scene of the emergency cautiously. Some would mutter a word of encouragement and others...a nod of support. I settled for silently praying for the passenger but I had begun to have a headache! What was clear though is that from the time of that announcement, the atmosphere in that flight became unsettled. Perhaps, what was going on was a reminder of our humanness to most of us. And the rude realisation that it could have been any of us made some of us in that flight restless and people did what they could to show support. The experience is best described as one of those moments when life is whispering ‘‘I hope you realise this could be you’’ Thankfully, the young man was stabilised and most people went back to their seats. He was placed on an IV drip. And the older lady that helped stabilise him kept going to check on him from time to time. The male cabin crew also dutifully kept an eye on him. I must admit that as I watched the two ladies bring their professional training to bear on the situation, I felt a sense of pride at being a woman and muttered ‘‘dear daughter, please try to study a course that is worthwhile in school...if only for moments like this, when you have to be there for humanity”. I think it’s high time Airlines began to give a discounts to medical professionals because when ‘‘emergencies’’ arise in the sky, these people selflessly rise to the occasion. When we landed and began to disembark, I made sure that I got close enough to the passenger and said to him ‘’God be your strength’’. And he nodded. It turned out that he was the tall, slim, and dark young man, who was wheeled into the aircraft when we were boarding, This next encounter happened in church! Sometimes when my soul is troubled, I walk into the church (usually empty), kneel at the altar to pray and I feel calm, afterward. So, on this particular day when I turned around to leave, I caught sight of a lady (kneeling in between the pews) ...her eyes were closed but she was crying and wiping her tears. Then, I remembered the man who was lying down before the altar when I walked in. I looked around and saw two or three others, kneeling or sitting...heads bowed. And I muttered “Ije uwa’’ (the journey of life)! As you are embarking on your honeymoon, someone is receiving a sack letter/quit notice. The news of a newborn in one household versus a tense atmosphere in another...thanks to an unpleasant health report. A marriage that someone has so much hope for is crumbling before their very eyes while another is awash with the excitement of a dream come true. Someone is popping champagne over a new car while another has just buried a loved one. I have lost count of how many times I was taking a leisurely walk overseas and a wailing ambulance would speed by...leaving you praying for the best outcome in whatever the situation is. It’s all life and her endless circles! One of the reasons it’s not good to attack another’s belief system is that it could just be their coping mechanism. As long as their idea of “knowing God” has a human face, I don’t judge people’s faith, because, you don’t know what’s still holding them up. A habit that I have picked up is just saying a prayer for people who may be going through a challenging phase, now and then. You don’t need to know people to keep them in your prayers. It could be someone you read their story in the media. What you do at that moment is to spare a minute or two and say a prayer for them. Prayer cleanses the soul but every prayer you say does not always have to be for you and yours, alone.",

        "content": "Thunder Bay – On Sunday, around a hundred people gathered at St. Ignatius High School to walk in support of hospice palliative care. After registration and opening ceremonies, hikers met at Boulevard Lake - across from the school. They then began the five km walk around the lake. “We’re raising funds today to support the really important services that we’re able to offer people in the city of Thunder Bay at no charge,” said Donna Jeanpierre, executive director of Hospice Northwest Services. “We offer palliative end of life support, grief and bereavement support to adults and children.” This year marked the 13th annual Hike for Hospice. Jeanpierre said they are excited to have continued support over the years, and gain new support each year. Hospice Northwest’s Hike for Hospice had a goal of raising $50,000. As of Monday, Hospice Northwest had raised over $42,000. “We want to raise awareness for the important work that we do,” Jeanpierre said. “We have well-trained volunteers, we just want to make sure that the conversations are happening around the supports that we offer to people who are at end of life, or going through grief and loss.\" Every walker was given a flower to cast on the water in memory of a loved one they have lost, if they would like. They were also given a ribbon to write the name of a loved one they lost and are missing, and tie it to the butterfly memorial wall on Adelaide Street. Amy and David Binch attended the Hike for Hospice in hopes to promote the organization. “We tragically lost our one-year-old son Fletcher in July of 2023,” Amy said. After the loss of their son, Amy and David knew they needed support, but were not sure where to get it. Within days of Fletcher's passing, Hospice Northwest was able to connect the couple with various services, Amy said. “They were very compassionate and understanding.” The couple have attended quite a few workshops for themselves as well as for their four-year-old son. Amy said that some of the services are specific to certain populations, such as grieving parent workshops. Her four-year-old son also attends programming for children, to help him understand what grief is and to help him find positive coping mechanisms. Amy’s husband, David, attends men-specific groups as well. “We’re here today to express our gratitude and share our story to let others know that Hospice Northwest is a wonderful service that helps individuals struggling with grief,\" Amy said. “I would recommend these services to anybody that’s grieving the loss of someone they love.” “Hike for Hospice is their biggest fundraiser of the year, which helps them to be able to continue to offer those supports to people free of charge in our community,” she said. “If you can donate, please donate.” For more information, or to donate to hike for hospice, visit Hospice Northwest’s website.",

Unsurprisingly, all but one has occurred since the turn of the century as offenses have emphasized the passing game in recent years. When legendary quarterback threw for 5,084 yards in 1984, he became the first NFL quarterback to hit the 5,000-yard milestone. Today, however, that season doesn't even rank in the top 10 all-time as it pertains to passing yardage. So, who exactly does crack the top 10? Let's take a look. When arrived to play for the in 2012, nobody knew what to expect, as he'd missed the entire 2011 season with a neck injury after spending the first 13 years of his Hall of Fame career with the . After an outstanding first season with the Broncos, Manning continued to show he still had what it took to be an elite quarterback. In 2013, Manning led the league with 5,477 passing yards and 55 touchdown passes, setting new NFL records in both categories. The Broncos also became the first NFL team to score more than 600 points in a season, putting up 605. At one point during the season, Manning, who won his record fifth NFL MVP award, threw for 403 yards with five touchdown passes in a win over the and then came right back with 397 passing yards and threw four more touchdown passes in a win over the . In the final week of the 2011 season, quarterback set numerous league records, including the most passing yards in a single season, finishing the year with 5,476 yards, a record that stood until Manning broke it by a single yard two years later. Brees had one heck of a season in 2011. Not only did he lead all quarterbacks in passing yards, but he was also tops in completions (468), completion percentage (71.2%), and touchdown passes (46). While he was named Offensive Player of the Year, he failed to win NFL MVP, finishing second to . It was the third straight season in which Brees was the NFL's best in completion percentage. It was also the third time in his career that he led the NFL in passing yards and touchdown passes.

In just three seasons with the Buccaneers, Brady racked up 14,643 passing yards, good for third on the franchise's all-time list.

An athletic quarterback with a strong arm and pinpoint accuracy, Mahomes has already put up some ridiculous numbers, some of which helped him earn the second NFL MVP award of his young career during the 2022 season. The Texas Tech alum led the Chiefs to a 14-3 record and led all quarterbacks with 5,250 passing yards, also leading all signal-callers with 41 touchdown passes. Mahomes earned his fifth straight Pro Bowl selection and was named an All-Pro for the third time in his career. Brady obviously had plenty of outstanding seasons with the Patriots, but his 2011 season, which often goes overlooked, was arguably one of the greatest of his career. Brady started all 16 games, going 13-3, and put up his only 5,000-yard passing season in New England, finishing with a then-career-best 5,235 yards. He also tossed 39 touchdowns and completed 65.6% of his passes. Brady set the tone early in the season by throwing for a career-high 517 yards and adding four touchdown passes in a win over the Miami Dolphins. In the final game of the regular season, he became just the fourth player in NFL history to throw for better than 5,000 yards in a season. Brees was the perfect fit in the Saints' pass-happy offense under head coach Sean Payton. And in his 11th season with the team in 2016, he continued to light it up. After having already led the NFL in passing yardage six times, Brees made it a seventh in 2016. The former Purdue star threw the ball a league-leading 673 times and piled up 5,208 passing yards, but he went just 7-9. While the win-loss record wasn't good in '16, Brees certainly was, completing 70% of his passes. Oddly enough, that was not one of the six seasons in which he led the league in completion percentage. He opened the season with a 423-yard game, including a 98-yard TD pass to Brandin Cooks. In Week 6, he threw for 465 yards, setting a record for the most 400-yard games in an NFL career. He also became the sixth player in league history to record 50,000 passing yards with one team. Brees had yet another 5,000-plus-yard season with the Saints in 2012, but New Orleans finished with another 7-9 record. In 2012, Brees finished with a league-best 5,177 yards and also topped the NFL with 43 touchdown passes. His 19 interceptions were also the most by any quarterback. It was a tough year for the Saints, who had to play without Payton, who was suspended for the year for his role in the infamous Bountygate scandal. Despite the season-long distraction, Brees continued to put up big numbers and made what was then his fifth straight Pro Bowl. Brees clearly is no stranger to this list. He eclipsed the 5,000-yard passing mark in a season five times in his career and, as mentioned, led the league in passing seven times. He followed his impressive 2012 campaign with another strong season in 2013 when he racked up a league-high 5,162 yards. He also threw for 39 touchdown passes, leading the Saints to an 11-5 record. In Week 14, he became the fastest quarterback to reach 50,000 passing yards in his career during a win over the , also throwing four touchdown passes in that game. Brees was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week three times in 2013. While put up big numbers throughout his NFL career, it took him 15 years with the before he hit the 5,000-yard passing mark. Big Ben came close in 2014 when he led the NFL in passing with 4,952 yards. In 2018, he finally hit the milestone when he finished with a league-leading 5,129 yards. He also tossed 34 touchdown passes but also recorded an NFL-worst 19 interceptions. For the first time in his career, Roethlisberger topped all quarterbacks in passing attempts (675) and completions (452). In Week 2, he threw for 453 yards and three touchdowns in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In Week 12, he had a season-high 462 yards in a loss to the Denver Broncos. Despite the big numbers, Roethlisberger's streak of four straight Pro Bowl seasons came to an end in 2018. played the first five years of his NFL career with the Buccaneers and had his best statistical season in his final year with the club in 2019. Winston, the in the 2015 NFL Draft, threw a league-leading 626 passes in 2019 and led the NFL with 5,109 passing yards. He threw a career-high 33 touchdown passes, but his 30 interceptions were the most in the league and made him the only quarterback in league history to throw 30 TDs and 30 picks in the same season. In 2019, Winston broke several Bucs records, including passing yards and passing attempts. He also became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 100 touchdown passes in his career. In a Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions, Winston had 458 passing yards and threw four touchdowns. Winston left the Bucs after the season, making way for Brady to take his talents to Tampa.",

        "description": "Bruce Springsteen took to Instagram to reveal that he and the E Street Band won't be able to perform at a few upcoming concert dates.",
        "content": "Bruce Springsteen has been forced to postpone three upcoming concerts in Europe due to \"vocal issues\" after a doctor ordered the artist to rest his voice for ten days. In a statement released by Springsteen to his social media accounts on Sunday, it was revealed that -- after having to postpone a performance in Marseille, France, on May 25 -- Springsteen and his iconic band would be missing three additional shows in Prague, Czech Republic, and Milan, Italy. \"Following yesterday's postponement in Marseille due to vocal issues, further examination and consulting has led doctors to determine that Bruce should not perform for the next ten days,\" the statement read. \"With this in mind, additional postponements are required for Airport Letnany in Prague (originally scheduled for May 28) and San Siro Stadium in Milan (originally scheduled for June 1 and 3).\" Additionally, the statement said that the 74-year-old rock legend is \"recuperating comfortably\" amid his vocal rest, and that \"he and the E Street Band look forward to resuming their hugely successful European stadium tour on June 12 in Madrid at the magnificent Civitas Metropolitan.\" The statement also shared that new dates for the postponed concert shows will be \"announced shortly.\" This isn't the first time recently that the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" artist -- who is on the Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's 2024 World Tour -- had to cancel or postpone shows due to a health concern. In September 2023, Springsteen announced that the entire 2023 World Tour would have to be postponed as he recovered from peptic ulcer disease. \"Bruce Springsteen has continued to recover steadily from peptic ulcer disease over the past few weeks and will continue treatment through the rest of the year on doctor's advice,\" he tweeted at the time. \"With this in mind, and out of an abundance of caution, all remaining 2023 tour dates for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band will be postponed until 2024.\" The tweeted statement concluded with a quote from Springsteen himself, which read, \"Thanks to all my friends and fans for your good wishes, encouragement, and support. I'm on the mend and can't wait to see you all next year.\" Meanwhile, Springsteen's latest health concern comes almost four months after the legendary rocker announced the news that his mother, Adele Springsteen, had died at age 98. The \"Dancing in the Dark\" singer announced the news of his mom's death in a sweet tribute posted to Instagram, where he posted an adorable video of his mother dancing on her front porch to swing music. Springsteen also shared in the caption the lyrics to his 1998 song \"The Wish,\" which was written to honor and thank his mom for the sacrifices she made throughout his life so that he could pursue his dreams. Springsteen often got a chance to dance with his mom over the decades -- notably, the duo shared a cute moment a few years ago during one of his concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City in March 2016. The rock legend jammed out with his then-90-year-old mom, treating her to a little dance and even a kiss during a very sweet moment of the concert. Springsteen revealed during a Broadway performance in 2021 that his mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a decade ago, according to Today. The rocker shared with his fans, \"She's 95 and she's 10 years into Alzheimer's and that’s taken a lot away from us... But the need to dance hasn't left her.\" \"She can't speak. She can't stand. She can't feed herself. But when she sees me, there is always a smile. Still a smile. There's still a kiss,\" Springsteen shared. \"There's a sound which she makes when she sees me. It's just the sound, but I know it means 'I love you.'\" RELATED CONTENT: Video News Movies News News Music News",

Nithya Raman, who has been a member of the City Council since 2020, blamed Toyota, accusing the company of making their cars so 'easy to steal'. The video, which was filmed in 2023, has attracted widespread criticism as residents accuse LA D emocrats of neglecting to target thieves as car theft continues to surge. The video comes as actor and General Hospital star, Johnny Wactor, was shot and killed on Saturday when he interrupted thieves breaking into his car attempting to steal a catalytic converter. He was only 37. In 2023, nearly 8,000 catalytic converter components stolen in a single year, a staggering 728 percent increase from 2018. In an attempt to crackdown on theft LA City Council passed a 8-4 motion vote that made it illegal to possess a detached catalytic converter unless you had valid documentation. A viral video has resurfaced revealing Los Angeles council member Nithya Raman blaming Toyota for the increasing catalytic-converter theft ravaging the city - while opposing a motion to hold criminals accountable This comes as the latest victim, actor and General Hospital star, Johnny Wactor, was shot and killed on Saturday in LA when he confronted thieves breaking into his car attempting to steal a catalytic converter But Raman opposed the motion and placed the blame on the car company, Toyota, claiming they should not make their cars so 'easy to steal.' 'In this case, I think one of the things that infuriates me is that we have a company — whatever, Toyota — who makes the Prius, that essentially has a device on their cars which is super easy to remove. It's basically the value of a MacBook, right?' said Raman in the 2023 Council meeting. 'That is put in a place that is incredibly easy to access in your car, and all the costs of the thefts are given to us to bear instead of them [Toyota] having to manufacture a car that actually is not so easy to be stolen,' she continued. Fellow Democrat, Eunises Hernandez, agreed and said the ban on possessing a catalytic was 'racist'. 'Criminalizing the mere possession of a catalytic converter, I think is the wrong way to go, because we know which communities are gonna be the ones most criminalized because of this,' Hernandez said. 'This makes it a misdemeanor, it creates a fine of $1000, you can go to jail for six months.' 'Even a short incarceration of a couple of days can destabilize someone's life forever, and leads to collateral consequences that they have to carry until they can get an expungement, if they can get that ... I'm not in agreement with creating more opportunities to criminalize our communities,' Hernandez continued. According to a KTLA report, police officers reported to the area of Pico Boulevard and Hope Street around 3:25am Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year . Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace. LA has seen a sharp increase in car thefts since the Covid-19 pandemic - with the rate of thefts increasing every year since 2019. There were more than 25,000 auto thefts across the city in 2023, a staggering 64 percent increase as compared to pre-pandemic numbers.

The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 percent, according to ABC 7 . Wactor, who appeared in 164 episodes of the soap opera from 2020 to 2022, was leaving his side job at a rooftop bar with a female colleague at around 3:25am Saturday in the area of West Pico Boulevard and South Hope Street, when he saw the three men, believing he was being towed. Police said that one of the three men, all of whom were wearing masks, shot Wactor before fleeing in a separate vehicle. Paramedics got to the scene shortly after and took him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The masked suspects remain at large and have yet to be identified or described. Wactor's mother Scarlett told TMZ that her son saw three men trying to steal the catalytic converter off of his car Scarlett Wactor, Johnny's mother, said that her son didn't attempt to fight them or even stop them from stealing but they still shot him and got away. Johnny's younger brother Grant confirmed to DailyMail.com that Johnny was shot in the chest as he came upon the suspects who were trying to steal the catalytic converter from his truck. He said his brother and his co-worker had to park about two blocks from the restaurant, so they were walking to their cars after they finished their shift. Grant said they were brought up as 'Southern gentlemen,' so he was not surprised his older brother was walking his female co-worker to her car. 'We're Southern, born and raised, and we would never let a female walk to their car by herself.'

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS – Josef Newgarden’s second consecutive Indy 500 victory has made him the richest winner in the history of the famed race. The Indianapolis 500 purse record was shattered for the third year in a row as the 108th edition of the race posted $18,456,000 with two-time race winner Newgarden of Team Penske earning $4.288 million. After record-breaking payouts in 2022 and 2023, this is the largest purse and largest winner’s payout in the century-plus history of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” “The Indianapolis 500 is the greatest race in the world, and this record-breaking purse is reflective of just how monumental competing in and winning at Indy is for these drivers,” Penske Entertainment President and CEO Mark Miles said in a release. “Despite weather challenges, the Month of May featured packed grandstands and intense on-track action. Presenting this purse is the ideal end cap to an epic month.” Kyle Larson, the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion, earned Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year honors. Arrow McLaren/Rick Hendrick driver Kyle Larson (17) walks through pit lane with his family Sunday, May 26, 2024, during the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Kyle Larson — Bob Goshert/For IndyStar / USA TODAY NETWORK Larson, driving for Arrow McLaren, was attempting to become the fifth driver to complete “The Double,” racing the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. The Hendrick Motorsports star’s plans were foiled by a four-hour rain delay in Indianapolis, and he arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway during a rain delay that eventually resulted in the Coke 600 being called early. Larson finished 18th in the Indy 500 after qualifying fifth. He was running sixth before speeding on a green-flag pit stops with 70 laps remaining. Larson earned a $50,000 bonus for being named Rookie of the Year, adding to a total take-home prize of $178,000. Purse awards are presented annually at the Victory Celebration, held this year at the JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis Monday night. Newgarden’s purse included a $440,000 rollover bonus from BorgWarner for earning back-to-back wins in the “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The jackpot increases by $20,000 each year but has only been awarded only one other time since its inception when Helio Castroneves won the Indy 500 in 2001-02. The prize money can be claimed only by a driver who wins the Indy 500 in consecutive years. Each year, the jackpot increases by an additional $20,000 and continues until the next driver wins the race in consecutive years. Newgarden is the sixth driver to win consecutive Indy 500s since the race’s 1911 debut. The was Wilbur Shaw in 1939-40, followed by Mauri Rose 1947-48, Bill Vukovich in 1953-54, Al Unser in 1970-71 and Castroneves. The Indy 500 race winner has attempted to defend his title 83 times with an average finish position of just 13.04 place. “BorgWarner looks forward to the excitement of the Indianapolis 500 every year, and we’re thrilled to increase the stakes even further for Josef Newgarden this year with the rolling jackpot prize,” said Frédéric Lissalde, President and CEO, BorgWarner. “We’re anxious to see if Newgarden will meet me in Victory Circle for the second consecutive year and cash in on the jackpot for the first time in over 20 years.” Team Penske driver Josef Newgarden (2) smiles for a photo Monday, May 27, 2024, after winning the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Josef Newgarden — Grace Hollars/IndyStar / USA TODAY NETWORK “The Indianapolis 500 means everything to us, but extra money is a motivator, and it would be great to have this bonus,” Newgarden said. “Borg Warner is such a tremendous partner of the Speedway and of this iconic event. They are the custodian of the iconic trophy of the Indianapolis 500. “It’s pretty cool that they provide this opportunity, and let’s see if we can get it done.” The chance to win the rollover bonus has kept the season of celebration rolling for Newgarden and BorgWarner. “Yeah, I think that’s a good way to put it,” the Team Penske driver said. “We’ve had a fun time over the last 12 months. It’s been amazing to experience what winning the Indianapolis 500 is like. There is truly, nothing that compares to it. “And I’m excited about this year. Hopefully, we’ll have another opportunity to win this race. It would mean the world to me to get another one here.” Helio Castroneves of Brazil celebrates his back-to-back victories by drinking two jugs of the traditional milk, 26 May 2002, in the 86th running of Indy 500 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, IN.

Their average finish has been 13.11 place. Newgarden was the 75 driver to win the Indy 500. In addition to the BorgWarner rollover bonus, Newgarden’s back-to-back Indy 500 wins was a record-extending 20 victory for Team Penske. “It’s a big deal,” Newgarden said. “Roger is always looking at the next goal post. There is no one I respect more than Roger Penske and this team. To be able to come back here as winners to compete, with this group, it means the world to me. And it is a huge victory for all of us.” The year’s average payout for NTT IndyCar Series drivers was $543,000, which also exceeds last year’s average of $500,600.

        "description": "Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.",
        "content": "BRUSSELS — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of Hamas. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,” Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it’s too heavy. It’s too important.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by Ireland, Spain and non-EU member Norway might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Angry words abounded, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence. Those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. “In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,” he said. Also on Monday, Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. Slovenia launched the recognition procedure earlier this month, and Golob has been under pressure to speed up the process since Spain, Norway and Ireland announced they would go ahead with recognition. Borrell said the actions of the Israeli government, including plans to stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, could no longer be reconciled with the idea he had about the state of Israel. “From now on, I will never again say ‘Israel,’ (but) will say ‘Netanyahu government’ because it is this government who is taking these decisions,” Borrell said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which fighters stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 45 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply” to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances “”when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” The joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.”",

        "content": "In Cannes this year, the Red Sea International Film Festival celebrated the achievements of Women in Cinema – both in front of and behind the camera – who are helping to shape the film industry and inspiring a new generation of talent in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Four of these women – French-Sengalese director Ramata-Toulaye Sy, Thai actress-model-singer Freen, Saudi singer and actress Aseel Omran and Saudi actress Adhwa Fahad – all stepped into Deadline’s Cannes Studio to talk about their current projects and how they feel the issue of gender parity in the entertainment business is shaping up. “There are opportunities for women, but we need to do more because it’s not enough,” said Sy, director of last year’s Cannes Competition entry Banel & Adama . “Last year when I was in Competition, there were seven women in Competition and this year just four. I think there’s space for us, but people don’t want to give us the space. It’s our right to be there – we are allowed to be there, but people don’t want us to be there.” Related Stories Festivals 'Furiosa' Composer Tom Holkenborg On His Approach To 'Mad Max Saga' Score: \"Restraint Was The Way Forward\" - Crew Call Podcast News 'Simon Of The Mountain' Review: Federico Luis' Critics' Week Winner Is A Wholly Original Debut - Cannes Film Festival Commenting on the current #MeToo movement in France, she expressed that it made her feel a little bit “sad and depressed” because it’s moving “really slow.” “I think the day we’re not going to hear this question [about gender parity] is the day we know we at least have achieved what we want,” added Omran, who has appeared in Netflix’s Black Crows , Qabel Lil Kaser in addition to releasing three studio albums.

        "description": "After a second pre-season win on Saturday in Edmonton, the Riders now have two weeks before their first game of the CFL season",
        "content": "Article content The final week of training camp for the Saskatchewan Roughriders looks quite different this year. Following Saturday’s pre-season game in Edmonton , the Roughriders have returned to Regina’s Mosaic Stadium for the final week of camp after the CFL club held the first two weeks of workouts at Griffiths Stadium in Saskatoon. Having already played both of their pre-season games last week — wins against Winnipeg and Edmonton — the Green and White aren’t preparing for an opponent this week but instead Saturday’s roster cutdown day where some tome tough decisions will have to be made when it comes to who the team will keep, who will be offered a practice roster spot and who will be released. “There’s still a lot of close battles,” said Riders’ head coach Corey Mace. “And it might come down to special teams if someone has more value. “It might come down to a few (missed assignments) that they have this week that might be the ultimate factor for them so games or not, the evaluation is still tightly watched.” While game action traditionally carries more weight when it comes to evaluating players, Mace said there’s still plenty he wants to see this week including how players react to five days of workouts without preparing for an opponent. “The main thing is just knowing that we don’t have a game,” said Mace. “Usually people have got something to look forward to to get them amped up. “We’re done (games) so how are you going to approach each day of practice because this is still training camp and it still counts. “You’ve got to be just as detailed in the playbooks. All the same things we preach, you should come out here and treat each practice like it’s a game. “We’ll be dialled because nothing is changing for us as far as coaches and evaluation.” Following Saturday’s 28-27 pre-season win in Edmonton , Mace was happy with how his team was able to find a way to win a game that saw the Elks turn the ball over five times to Saskatchewan. However, the first-year head coach also saw plenty of things his team needs to clean up. “From a special teams standpoint and a defensive standpoint, it’s really good to see,” Mace said of the turnovers. “We do have a knack for the ball and we’ve kind of had that since camp has started so that’s encouraging to see. “It’s easy to look at the good stuff. (But) as coaches, we always try to fix the bad stuff so that’s always going to be the main focus.” While the team can use some of the week to get a head start on the CFL season — which begins on June 8 when the Riders make a return trip to Edmonton — there are still positional battles to be ironed out this week including at American receiver. With Shawn Bane Jr. and Jerreth Sterns presumably having secured starting spots, there’s potentially one more available and it appears to be between rookies KeeSean Johnson, Geronimo Allison and Dohnte Meyers, who have all shown flashed during the pre-season. Fellow Americans Jake Parker, Kalija Lipscomb and Joe Robustelli could also in the mix for a practice roster spot. “That was a position spot we knew there was going to be some tough battles there,” said Mace. “The first week, some guys stepped up (and) the second week, different guys stepped up. “So, you want consistency from guys but by the same token, you see that there’s some really good players at that position so that’s a good problem for us.” Now they have a week to figure it out. tshire@postmedia.com The Regina Leader-Post has created an Afternoon Headlines newsletter that can be delivered daily to your inbox so you are up to date with the most vital news of the day.

The 39-year-old netted twice in Al-Nassr's 4-2 triumph over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park, taking his total to 35 and surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah's previous record of 34 from the 2018-19 season. Hamdallah, who was also representing Al-Nassr when he set the record, achieved his tally in just 27 league games, four fewer than the ex- Manchester United and Real Madrid forward. Ronaldo had an early goal disallowed for offside but equalled the record in first-half stoppage time, controlling Mohammed Al-Fatil's long ball and firing home to open the scoring in Al-Nassr's final match of the season.

However, Ronaldo only had to wait another four minutes to claim his 35th goal of the season, heading home from a corner before being substituted. Goals from Abdulrahman Ghareeb and Meshari Al-Nemer, along with strikes from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho, saw Al-Nassr secure a 4-2 victory. They finished the season in second place, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 ahead of Al-Ahli in third.

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimised by a serial slingshot shooter,” the Asuza Police Department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 40 km east of Los Angeles, police said. Azusa police Lt. Jake Bushey said Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect's backyard. “We're not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group.

        "content": "MONTREAL , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: CAE) (TSX: NYSE: CAE ) “ CAE Inc . today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing May 30, 2024 and ending May 29, 2025 . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" TSX \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" NYSE \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (\" RBC \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" ASPP \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective June 3, 2024 . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" ADTV \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of May 16, 2024 , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value. About CAE At CAE, we equip people in critical roles with the expertise and solutions to create a safer world.

Caution concerning forward-looking statements This press release includes forward-looking statements, including in connection with CAE's NCIB, ASPP and future purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. Since forward-looking statements and information relate to future events or future performance and reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events, they are typically identified by words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"likely\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"will\", \"strategy\", \"future\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. All such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward‘looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward‘looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of May 27, 2024 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Specifically, there can be no assurance as to how many shares, if any, will ultimately be acquired under CAE's NCIB. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after May 27, 2024 . The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of CAE's NCIB.

        "content": "MONTREAL , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: CAE) (TSX: NYSE: CAE ) “ CAE Inc . today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing May 30, 2024 and ending May 29, 2025 . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" TSX \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" NYSE \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (\" RBC \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" ASPP \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective June 3, 2024 . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" ADTV \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of May 16, 2024 , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Griffith University Researchers have conducted one of the first quantitative studies of social structure and social foraging in Antarctic minke whales, using pioneering animal-borne camera tags. This study , published in Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology , sheds light on the complex social and foraging behaviors of these elusive krill specialists within the fragile Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. The study was led by Dr. Jenny Allen as a Griffith University Research Associate in collaboration with the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC). Data were collected in 2018 and 2019 around the Western Antarctic Peninsula as part of a research grant from the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs to Dr. Ari Friedlaender, a Professor in UCSC's Ocean Sciences Department. The study is unique in its use of motion-sensing, video- and audio-recording tags deployed on Antarctic minke whales for the first time to study their ecological role through analysis of their diving, foraging, and social behaviors. Data analyses focused on the whales' diving, foraging, and social behaviors, providing fresh insights into their ecological roles. Findings from the study indicated that Antarctic minke whales exhibit a \"fission–fusion\" social structure, frequently switching companions. This social flexibility is similar to what is seen in several other baleen whale species. In 60.6% of cases, whales were observed forming short-term associations, engaging in both foraging and non-foraging activities. Larger individuals were more likely to socialize, and this social interaction correlated with a noticeable reduction in their feeding efforts, regardless of dive depth. Furthermore, the study documented 12 instances where tagged whales associated with each other in pairs or trios. These groups demonstrated synchronized spatial movement and diving behaviors, suggesting that Antarctic minke whales employed group foraging strategies. Specifically, 67.5% of associated dives and 64% of associated feeding lunges were synchronized. \"These findings provide essential baseline information on the sociality and group foraging behaviors of Antarctic minke whales,\" Dr. Allen said. \"Understanding these patterns is crucial, especially as climate change continues to impact the Antarctic ecosystem.\" The study underscored the importance of Antarctic minke whales as top krill predators, highlighting their role within the ecosystem. The synchronized foraging behavior observed suggested these whales might optimize their feeding efficiency through cooperation, a behavior previously underappreciated in this species. \"This study is fascinating because it provides new information on complex and dynamic social and behavioral patterns by an animal that until now we had very little information about,\" says Dr. Friedlaender, the senior investigator on the project. This research not only enhances our understanding of Antarctic minke whale social and foraging ecology but also encourages the need for future studies aimed at more targeted investigations.

Ocon ruined Alpine’s entire race when he attempted to overtake teammate Pierre Gasly on the opening lap in Monaco. Every qualifying session and race from the 2024 FIA Formula One World ChampionshipTM LIVE in 4K. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > However, Ocon’s move failed as he suffered enough damage to force him out of the race and hampered Gasly’s efforts, although the latter managed to recover and finish 10th to secure a point. Ocon, who also copped a five-place grid penalty for the Canadian GP, apologised for the incident on social media as Gasly ripped his teammate in a stinging public spray. Alpine boss Bruno Famin was also highly critical of Ocon and threatened the 27-year-old will face “consequences”. According to Sky Sports reporter Craig Slater, those consequences could be as severe as being dropped for the Canadian GP on June 10 (AEST). “Bruno Famin, he was actually on the pit wall with Canal+ who called him up immediately in the aftermath of that first-lap crash and Famin spoke angrily and he talked about taking a tough decision, which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada,” Slater said. 'Why did he try to attack me?!' | 00:52 MORE COVERAGE ‘F*** me’: Verstappen’s radio message dripping in irony as world champ tastes his own medicine Monaco Wrap: F1 curse lifts in teary scenes; Piastri’s podium stunner after ugly first lap carnage Monaco Talking Pts: Horror crash exposes F1 rules farce; ‘out of line’ move could open door for Aussie “What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin. He will do what is best for the team. “But if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be, he is prepared to do that, but that decision has yet to be taken. “There were face-to-face meetings between Ocon and Famin in the aftermath of the Grand Prix yesterday. Ocon apologised, both privately face-to-face and publicly afterwards via social media. So let’s see what happens.” Should Ocon be dropped, Aussie star Doohan looms as the obvious candidate to step up into his seat. The 21-year-old joined Alpine as their reserve driver in 2023 and has already driven a number of practice laps for the team. If Doohan does secure a surprise call-up for the Canadian GP he would be the third Australian on the grid alongside Oscar Piastri and Daniel Ricciardo, who drive for McLaren and Visa CashApp RB respectively.",

His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships, and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" After retiring from basketball, he started his career in sports broadcasting in 1990. As a basketball broadcaster and analyst, he covered college and NBA games for broadcasters, including ESPN, CBS, and NBC, as well as the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. Advertisement His sports commentary was fun and colorful. Once, he gobbled down a cupcake still topped with a lit candle on live TV. He would often go on air wearing Grateful Dead t-shirts and other colorful attire. In a statement, Martin Jarmond, UCLA's Alice and Nahum Lainer Family Director of Athletics, said that Walton \"represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear.\" \"He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams,\"Jarmond said. \"We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.\"",

        "description": "Jhonatan Narváez to represent the country after controversial selection",
        "content": "The Ecuadorian Cycling Federation (FEC) announced on Monday that it has chosen Jhonatan Narváez (Ineos Grenadiers) for the single spot for the Paris Olympic Games road events over defending champion Richard Carapaz . Narváez will compete in both the time trial and road race in Paris. The FEC explained that it appointed the Ecuadorian representative \"as requested by the Ecuadorian Olympic Committee (COE), on the basis of federal autonomy and the regulations issued.\" In a statement issued on social media last week, Carapaz decried \"a lack of transparency and fairness\" in the selection process, and that they were \"clearly biased and lack the fundamental principles of sports justice and equity.\" However, on Monday, Carapaz issued a video wishing Narvaéz luck in Paris and thanking his supporters. The FEC only released its selection criteria in March but used UCI points gained from January 1 to May 21, 2024, to choose the top-ranked rider. Carapaz was ranked higher than Narváez in the UCI rankings, which calculate points on a rolling 12-month calendar, but the situation was reversed in results taken only from this year.

The EF Education First-EasyPost rider complained that the revision to the selection criteria came out after the start of the period to gain points had already begun. \"This should have been issued at the end of the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games or at the end of last season when all athletes started with zero points and could plan our season equitably,\" Carapaz stated. \"However, its publication in an improvised manner and without room for manoeuvre seems to be designed to keep me out of Paris and exempt the president of the FEC from any responsibility.\" Carapaz had appealed to the Ministry of Sport to intervene, but the FEC chose to finalise the selection before the request could be accepted. In 2021, Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian athlete to win a gold medal in cycling at the Olympics. He raced in Tokyo with Narváez. This season, Carapaz won his national time trial championship, while Narváez won the road race. Carapaz finished second overall in the Tour Colombia and won the final stage . He also won a stage of the Tour de Romandie . Narváez won the Down Under Classic and finished second in the Tour Down Under in January, and more recently won the opening stage of the Giro d'Italia .",

        "description": "Hostile occupation of nuclear sites could end in disaster",
        "content": "Russia has devastated vast portions of Ukraine and killed or kidnapped thousands of civilians, but Russian “ecocide is now a tool of war,” researcher Dr. Sasha Dovzhyk at a recent conference I attended at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York City. Dovzhyk said Russian planes, or artillery, have scattered small landmines, called “little petals” (also called PFM-1s), across 156,000 square kilometres, the equivalent to one-quarter of the country or four times the size of Switzerland. She added that removal will take years and cost billions and until that’s accomplished hundreds of thousands of people and animals will be injured or killed. “Scattered from aircraft or delivered by mortars, the “petals” spin through the air, bite into the earth and explode upon contact with as little as 5 kilograms of weight.... Hectare by hectare, Russia’s invasion turns barren the country which contains almost a quarter of the world’s chernozem, a highly fertile soil... Russia has turned Ukraine into the world’s biggest minefield. This is not the first environmental disaster perpetrated against Ukraine. In 1986, Kremlin incompetence caused a nuclear reactor to explode at Chornobyl, spreading radioactivity across the country and Europe. Now that area, 90 kilometres from Kyiv, is a no-go zone and a massive steel and concrete structure, or sarcophagus, contains the reactor. Now, Vladimir Putin doubles down on that catastrophe. In March 2022, right after the Feb. 24 invasion, Russia occupied Chornobyl’s no-go zone, then days later Ukraine’s biggest nuclear complex, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), also the largest reactor in Europe. Russian military officials have overseen its operations ever since. The United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been granted occasional access to monitor the ZNPP’s operations. But, in a recent report, the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency : “The IAEA observers at ZNPP reported that they continued to be denied timely and appropriate access to all areas important to nuclear safety and security.” There are concerns that maintenance is inadequate and that there isn’t enough power and water to keep reactors cool at all times. Testing and inspections are also a problem, and staff numbers at the facility have fallen from 11,500 workers to 4,500. Then, on June 6, 2023, the Russian-occupied dam was blown up — 80 miles away from ZZNP. This reduced the water levels in the reservoir that cools ZNPP’s reactors, and water must now be pumped in from local wells. (Experts concluded that Russian forces likely blew up a segment of the dam to hinder , but Russian authorities have denied the accusation.) Putin now controls Ukraine’s largest nuclear facility and the integrity of the Chernobyl sarcophagus which prevents the escape of radiation. This potential eco-terrorism is on an unimagined level: If just ZPNN explodes or is blown up, a meltdown would cause a massive fire and explosion that would release radiation over a vast area of Europe. The IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, in an April 2023 news release: “We are living on borrowed time when it comes to nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Unless we take action to protect the plant, our luck will sooner or later run out, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.” And the odds of catastrophe increased after the destruction of the nearly Nova Khakovka dam. Dovzhyk said this was the “first ever” intentional dam explosion. “Ecocide on this scale should be a crime in the International Criminal Court and isn’t yet,” she said. Ukraine is scarred with landmines, but also with pockmarks from bombing attacks. “Two dozen experts who spoke with Reuters, including soil scientists, farmers, grain companies and analysts, said it would take decades to fix the damage to Europe’s breadbasket — including contamination, mines and destroyed infrastructure — and that global food supplies could suffer for years to come. Shelling has also upset the delicate ecosystems of microorganisms that turn soil materials into crop nutrients such as nitrogen while tanks have compressed the earth, making it harder for roots to flourish, the scientists say,” Indian broadcast network NDTV. Putin’s war is barbaric and uncivilized. The Ukrainian diaspora, the G7, the UN and world’s environmental movements must condemn and stop Russia from perpetrating the biggest ecocide in history.",

        "content": "(ANNews) – The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the federal government broke its Treaty with Kainai Nation by shortchanging them on reserve land, but the province’s statute of limitations precludes the band from seeking remedy through the courts. On April 12, the court delivered its unanimous decision in the case of Jim Shot Both Sides v. Canada, in which Justice Michelle O’Bonsawin declared the Canadian government’s failure to fulfill its Treaty obligation “deplorable,” but argued the nation failed to bring the matter to court in the required timeframe. Kate Gunn of First Peoples Law, which represented Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta in the case, called the Supreme Court’s decision “disappointing.” “It affirms what the Blood Tribe has been saying all along,” Gunn said, referring to the Kainai Nation by its other name, “but it leaves the First Nation in a place where they’re not able to get substantive relief from the courts. I think it raises a couple of problematic and challenging issues.” The claim centred around the Crown’s failure to set aside as much land as was promised the Blood Tribe when it signed Treaty 7 in 1877. The First Nation, which is part of the Blackfoot Confederacy, initiated legal proceedings against the Crown in the 1980s. Under Alberta’s statute of limitations, plaintiffs have six years to file a lawsuit. The case hinged upon whether the clock began ticking in 1971—the year a Blackfoot researcher discovered the tribe received 162.5 fewer square miles of land than it was promised in Treaty 7—or 1982, when the Constitution Act officially codified Treaty rights under Canadian law. Federal Court ruled that the clock began ticking when the Constitution was signed, upholding the land claim. But the Court of Appeal reversed the ruling and prohibited the lawsuit. The Supreme Court sided with the Court of Appeal, arguing that Treaty rights were enforceable prior to the Constitution’s patriation, meaning Blood Tribe could have filed its lawsuit in 1971. Despite ruling that the lawsuit couldn’t proceed, Justice O’Bonsawin acknowledged the “longevity and magnitude of the Crown’s dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe.” “Canada breached its treaty promises to the Blood Tribe. Canada did not provide the land as promised: 162.5 fewer square miles were set aside than should have been,” the judge wrote. “This conduct is deplorable and does not reflect the fundamental objective of the modern law of treaty rights, which is the reconciliation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and their respective claims, interests, and ambition.” Acknowledging the wrongdoing, O’Bonsawin wrote, “will promote reconciliation and help to restore the nation-to-nation relationship between the Blood Tribe and the Crown.” The ruling gives the Blood Tribe an upper hand if it chooses to take the federal government to a specific claims tribunal, where it can be awarded up to $150 million. “The Blood Tribe and the Government of Canada are actively in negotiations on resolving this past injustice,” Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations spokesperson Carolane Gratton told the CBC. Calgary-based lawyer Ron Maurice, whose firm represented the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations as an intervenor in this case, called the ruling “cold comfort.” However, Maurice and Gunn both noted with optimism that the court didn’t rule on the constitutionality of provincial statutes of limitations as they pertain to holding the Crown accountable for historic misdeeds.",

Disclosure information is available on the original site. ___ Author: Andrew Hathaway, Professor, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Guelph Ottawa’s recent rejection of the City of Toronto’s request to decriminalize possession of controlled drugs is the latest shoe to drop in the resurgence of conservative anti-drug sentiment sweeping the country, and backtracking on reforms achieved in other jurisdictions. The announcement, citing concern for public safety, follows much the same script as that of the British Columbia government, which — after decriminalizing in 2023 — recently retreated to ban use in public places due to complaints of rampant drug use and continuing high rates of overdose. In early April, the state of Oregon went further, recriminalizing drug possession, replacing small fines with probation and up to six months in prison. The state was forced to backtrack on decriminalization measures that were passed in 2020 due to backlash over spiking overdoses during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Continued deaths due to drug use is all the evidence required to curb reform, despite the fact that these spikes occurred mostly during the pandemic. Research shows that the pandemic exacerbated many of the factors underlying the drug crisis. Health disparities and a lack of resources in underserved communities, social isolation, economic burden, stress, a lack of access to treatment and barriers to care all contribute to acute health effects of drug dependence. Regardless of these facts, drug policy reform is being blamed for these outcomes. It’s still all about the politics, of course In Ontario, predictably, the Ford government’s position on Toronto’s proposal is staunch opposition. Yet there is a sense of new momentum in the same old rhetoric: because drug users continue to die and use drugs in public places, presumably this means the experts and bleeding-heart liberals who supported reform have been soundly proven wrong. Most concerning, whereas conservatives and liberals may differ in their emphasis on punishment or treatment as solutions to drug problems, neither type of government seems prepared to fully implement a public health approach to substance use. That would mean addressing health disparities and deeper causes of substance use disorders, such as social inequality and social dislocation in Canadian society. No North American jurisdiction has been able to achieve this, despite the depth of knowledge and increasingly articulate demonstration of progressive public servants. Bureaucrats and politicians speak the language used by experts and other knowledgeable observers, who in turn inform the public of the need for harm reduction and more comprehensive, meaningful social policy reform. Logically, this requires commitment to decriminalization to shift the emphasis from punishing addicts to rehabilitating them. Increasingly, the discourse has gone further in establishing the need for more coherent public health policies addressing the root causes of addiction. To that end, important progress has been squandered by apparent bewilderment that addicts are still dying in large numbers, despite (and now because of) decriminalization measures that were never claimed to solve the problem of addiction, but rather to reduce known harms of criminalizing drugs. Decriminalizing drugs is not intended to be a solution to drug problems. Rather, it is a critical first step that’s necessary, but not sufficient, for replacing prohibition with a public health approach. Although Canada has made this work for regulating cannabis, it still has far to go to implement a more progressive public health approach to other drugs. The dangers of drug use stem not so much from psychoactive substances themselves, but from the toxic and unsafe drug supply that is the result of criminalization. But most of these substances continue to be treated as dangerous enough to ban. Yet there is scant consideration of the societal and legal circumstances and conditions that make drugs dangerous because they happen to be used in harmful ways by certain people. Whereas opiates, like alcohol, may have higher risk of overdose and adverse health effects due to physical dependence, all drugs can be misused with risk to health and public safety. Addiction and public health Decriminalizing drugs can make them safer, but not always, and reduce some harms of using drugs. What cannot be resolved entirely by decriminalization are the societal conditions that make substance use attractive enough to override considerations of concern for the self or others. Addiction thrives on hopelessness and feelings of despair, abandonment and disconnection, which are caused by homelessness, unemployment and discrimination, among other social problems. Despite the range of local addiction support services and treatment options called for in support of decriminalization proposals, so far decriminalization efforts have failed to go beyond half measures to implement a full array of integrated resources. Further off course yet, there has been little indication of meaningful commitment to addressing deeper structural root causes of addiction in North American society. Canada’s putative commitment to a public health approach has fared no better than in Oregon. None of these jurisdictions have gone far enough to remedy the real causes of drug problems. The fate of Portugal’s successful run as a global leader in tackling addiction, as opposed to punishing addicts, helps to clarify new lessons being learned in North America. Adopted over 20 years ago, decriminalization measures in Portugal have been implemented more successfully because its social safety net is far more comprehensive and better integrated with the criminal justice system. In recent years, as cuts to funding decimated rehabilitation programs, rising rates of overdose soon followed, demonstrating that decriminalization is not a silver bullet; if you do that and nothing else, things will get worse. Put otherwise, half measures are ineffective. Until we are prepared to go all in to solve the problem, people who use drugs will keep dying unnecessarily because we have not afforded them real hope. Sadly, this is news to no one. Not just experts. The Liberal government went on the record years ago by recognizing that decriminalizing drug use is not a panacea. Rather than committing to the next step, then and now, the necessary first step has been taken off the table. How about try giving it more time? Another lesson learned in Portugal, that evidently has not been resonating here in North American society, is that the kind of change required takes time. Now that decriminalization has been tried (and deemed a failure) in B.C. and Oregon, the reigning logic appears to be that going back to doing nothing makes more sense than doing something. Despite great patience shown during a century of misery inflicted on drug users in Canadian society, trying something new is scary. Cue the same old moral panic scapegoating addicts as dangerous people who those in charge prefer should not be seen. Decriminalizing drugs can’t eliminate people’s struggles with addiction. To work well, it requires a considerable level of investment, similar to what has historically been devoted to policing and imprisonment of addicts. Redistributing resources to support the integration of services, housing and employment for more people is not, and has never been, prioritized over punishing drug users. Until that shift occurs, we will keep falling back on failed policies consistent with a war-on-drugs mentality that has now prevailed for 50 years against all logic. In the meantime, be prepared for a new wave of antiquated arguments proclaiming more liberal policies a failure. Commitment to half measures creates more problems than it solves. ___ Andrew Hathaway does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. ___ This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link.

Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

        "content": "Insecurity, which has claimed hundreds of lives and left many others missing, is a major challenge that has plagued the administration of President Bola Tinubu since the President came to power on May 29, 2023, GODFREY GEORGE writes As the blue skies folded up to welcome the dark clouds, 40 villagers in Zurak, a village in the Wase district of Plateau State were slaughtered by armed men on May 20, 2024. That Monday night, blood flowed and many families were left in mourning. Reports from the villagers showed that the daredevils rode motorbikes into the village and opened fire on the residents, torching homes as they did. The attack was the latest violence in an area that has long been a flashpoint for disputes over resources and outbreaks of intercommunal clashes. A resident, Musa Ibrahim, had told Sunday PRIMANEWS that the armed men who invaded the Zurak community, did so without cause. “As we speak, about 40 people have been confirmed dead. Zurak is a popular mining community,” he said. A local youth leader, Shafi’i Sambo, had told Reuters that, at least, 42 people had been killed in the raid. Although the Transition Committee Chairman of Wase, Hamisu Anani, could not be reached for comment, a youth leader in the community, Sampson Alheri, told our correspondent that the incident occurred around 6 pm that Monday when the sun had gone down and the market women were clearing their goods for the day. “It was a calculated attack. They knew people were already tired from the day and would not expect the attack. Although some people managed to escape from the community, several others could not make it. They were shot dead in cold blood,” he said. Another youth, who said he did not want to be named, said tension had begun to build from Sunday when some vigilantes sensed imminent danger and went to the bush where they encountered a camp of bandits. The next day, according to the source, the bandits came out in their numbers in anger, shooting and burning homes. Another resident, Hamisu Bashar, said he counted no fewer than 46 bodies. According to him, the deceased persons were not only from Wase but also from the Kanan Local Government Area and had come to the farm. Lamenting, he said, “We are tired of this kind of situation. The government needs to come to our aid.” Spokesman of the state police command, Alfred Alabo, while confirming the attack, said following the aggressive onslaught against bandits by a combined team of Department of State Services and other security operatives in Bangalala forest, Wase, Plateau State, a border between Plateau, Bauchi and Taraba states, seven bandits were neutralised in the area. “Other bandits who fled during the operation attacked Zurak and Dakai villages, killed nine persons, and burnt down six houses while on the run. The Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, has made more deployments to the area and has directed the area commander of Langtang to relocate his base to Wase LGA with immediate effect. “The command is also pleased to announce to the state government and the people of Plateau State that one of the bandits, who escaped and went to seek treatment at a hospital in Wase, was arrested with gunshot wounds. The suspect has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Jos for discreet investigation,” Alabo added. Wase has deposits of zinc and lead, while Plateau as a whole is known for its tin mining industry. Sitting on the dividing line between Nigeria’s mostly Muslim North and predominantly Christian South, Plateau often sees outbreaks of violence sparked by disputes between nomadic herders and pastoral farmers. Climate change has also escalated tensions over grazing land, water access, and other resources, such as the state’s metal reserves. Parts of North-West and North-Central Nigeria have also been terrorised by heavily armed criminal gangs, who raid villages to loot and carry out mass kidnappings for ransom. Earlier in the year, inter-communal clashes erupted in Plateau’s Mangu town that left churches and mosques burnt, more than 50 people dead and thousands displaced. More killings in Plateau On April 17, communities in the Bokkos Local Government Area of the state gunmen identified by locals as herders killed more than 30 locals, while many women and children fled to other areas. A Bokkos resident, who asked not to be named, told the Foundation for Investigative Journalism that four natives protecting a part of the Ghatingut village in the Mbar district of Bokkos were shot to death by the herders. He said the attackers also killed one person in Wumat and extended their destruction to places like Kawel and Butura Kampani. “There was an attack at Butura Kampani on Monday. As a result, the women of the area came out to protest inside the town, stating that they wanted their leaders to do something about the attacks because they were tired,” he told the FIJ. “Inside Bokkos town, you’d hear gunshots in different locations almost every night. Now, there are plenty of cows around Bokkos town, and we don’t know why they are there,” he added. In recent times, there’s been unrest in Kuteng, Bokkos; Kopnanle, Mangu, and around the borders of Bokkos. In January, scores of people were killed on their farms in Miyanga. Between December 23 and December 26, 2023, more than 160 people lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Bokkos and Mangu. 23 JTF men killed in Borno That same month, in Borno State, at least 23 members of Nigeria’s civilian joint task force were killed on Saturday, April 27, in separate attacks by militants and an armed kidnapping gang in the area. In Borno State, armed men suspected to be Islamic State West Africa Province fighters used an improvised explosive device to blow up a vehicle carrying the civilian joint task force team, a local force chairman, told Reuters. The CJTF was first formed in 2013 to protect communities in the North-East and help the military fight Boko Haram and later its offshoot, ISWAP. The force has since been extended to other northern states grappling with armed kidnapping gangs. The CJTF chairman for the Gamboru Ngala area near the border with Cameroon, Tijjanima Umar, said his team was travelling to Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when they drove over the IED. “As the mine blew up, nine of them died instantly while two other people had severe injuries and were immediately taken to hospital for treatment,” Umar told Reuters. The Nigerian military was not immediately available to comment. Although severely curtailed by Nigerian security forces, Boko Haram and ISWAP still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and the military. In northwestern Sokoto State, 14 CJTF members were said to have been killed and several missing following an ambush by gunmen also in April, task force sector commandant Ismail Haruna told Reuters. Haruna said the CJTF members were killed in Sokoto’s Isa Local Government Area, where they had raided and destroyed a bush camp belonging to a known armed kidnapping gang leader. The gang quickly regrouped and ambushed the CJTF as they drove back to the state capital, he added. 21 villagers killed in Kogi On April 4, gunmen killed at least 21 villagers in Kogi State, in the wake of clashes between herders and farmers in the area, fuelled by the growing pressure on land resources. The Chairman of the Omala Local Government Area of Kogi where the violence took place, Edibo Mark, said around 21 people were buried that day. He said the attack was a reprisal by herders after the villagers three days earlier killed six of them (herders), including two who were beheaded. Violence between farmers and pastoralists has become increasingly common in recent years as population growth leads to an expansion of the area dedicated to farming, leaving less land available for open grazing by nomads’ herds of cattle. “It’s tragic, we never expected something like this,” a resident, Elias Atabo, 54, told Reuters. “The attack lasted not more than 45 minutes,” he added. Another resident, simply identified as Julius, said up to 100 herdsmen attacked the village on Thursday and started shooting indiscriminately, adding that 19 bodies were recovered after the incident with an additional 15 found on Friday morning. Julius said most of the casualties were older people who could not escape the assailants. Kogi is one of Nigeria’s North-Central states, where the Muslim North meets the Christian South. Competition over land use is particularly intractable in the region as the fault lines between farmers and herders often overlap with ethnic and religious divisions. The Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East has worsened the problem by driving herders into the middle belt and further South, analysts say, while climate change and increasing aridity in the North are also contributory factors. In October 2022, President Bola Tinubu, who was the then-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, promised to end insecurity if elected, but this has not been the case, with the many recorded killings and mass abductions. In December 2023, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume, said Tinubu was determined to end the insecurity ravaging many parts of the country, another promise that has yet to be fulfilled. Over 1,000 killed in Q1 2024 At least 1,027 civilians lost their lives to preventable incidents such as violent clashes, armed robbery, abductions and killings by Boko Haram, and other forms of terrorist attacks in the first quarter of 2024. In the same period, 123 security agents, ranging from members of the police to officials of the Nigeria Security Civil Defence Corps and soldiers, lost their lives. The top seven states with the highest number of such deaths, according to SBM Intelligence, are Zamfara (482), Borno (329), Katsina (328), Benue (297), Kaduna (157), Plateau (99), and Delta (97). The least affected states are Cross River (six), Lagos (five), Ekiti (four), Jigawa (four), Ondo (three), Abia (two), and Oyo State (two). On January 1, Boko Haram insurgents invaded two Chibok communities in Borno, killing 14 people and abducting a lady. The following day, insurgents killed two locals in Dure and Wala communities in the Gwoza area of the state. By the end of January, Fulani herders had killed more than 31 locals in the Bokkos and Barkin Ladi local government areas and the violence has continued. In 2023 alone, 400 people in these affected lost their lives to terrorist attacks while the government failed to take preemptive action. In the 45 days between May 29 and July 13, 2023, over 600 people were killed by non-state actors across the country. According to data, these killings primarily resulted from the activities of bandits, Boko Haram insurgents, ethnic militias, armed robbers, and other non-state actors. Data from SBM Intelligence revealed that about 629 Nigerians were killed in the last 45 days under the Tinubu administration. Other data from the Council on Foreign Relations’ Nigeria Security Tracker and media reports checked by the ICIR showed that non-state actors killed 587 people within the same period. •Youths protesting killings Photo: 247Ureports Tinubu’s promises on security In his victory speech after securing the APC presidential ticket in June 2022, Tinubu promised a secure, prosperous, united Nigeria if he won the 2023 general elections. “They have been worrying us, but we will eliminate them. We are Nigerians. We are sure that no animal in the darkness of the night, no intruders, no destroyers, can bring Nigeria backward. Forward we are moving,” he said. The President, while delivering his inaugural speech amid cheers from his supporters on Monday, May 29, at Eagle Square in Abuja, outlined the key initiatives to be anticipated from his administration and pledged to prioritise security and effectively tackle the menace of insecurity. “Security shall be the top priority of our administration because neither prosperity nor justice can prevail amidst insecurity and violence. To effectively tackle this menace, we shall reform our security doctrine and its architecture. “We shall invest more in our security personnel, and this means more than an increase in number. We shall provide better training, equipment, pay, and firepower,” Tinubu stated. Despite the promise to hit the ground running, data from various sources showed that the situation has yet to improve under his administration. Killing on inauguration day Four people were reportedly killed on the very Monday Tinubu took his oath of office, with two of them beheaded by gunmen who invaded the Rundele community in the Emohua Local Council of Rivers State. Many described this as a slap in the face of the Nigerian people, as it happened on the exact day of the handover. On May 30, 2023, bandits killed 25 people in three separate attacks in the Kanoma district of the Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State. On Wednesday, May 31, gunmen suspected to be cultists invaded two communities in the Ahoada East and Ahoada West local government areas of Rivers State, killing six people. The next month, the Makurdi branch of the Shitile Development Association in Benue State wrote a letter of intervention to the state government. Signed by its President, Door Samuel, and Secretary General, Zuai Ephraim, it stated that at least 40 people were killed in separate, simultaneous attacks on June 4 in several communities of the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. Samuel reported that after the dust settled on the June 4 shooting by gunmen at Imande Mbakange village market in Mbacher council ward, 28 people had been killed. The group added that on the same day, six other people were slaughtered in Michihe council ward, while another six were killed that night in Achamegh village, Mbagene Kpav, bringing the total number of those killed to 40 in just one night. In June, bandits killed no fewer than 50 people in the Gwadabawa and Tangaza local government areas of Sokoto for refusing to pay illegal levies imposed on them. In another incident, attacks by bandits on the villages of Janbako and Sakida in the Maradun Local Government Area, Zamfara State, resulted in the death of 31 people and injuries to many others. At least 13 people were also killed in the Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State on June 10 in a retaliatory attack between herders and farming communities. The incident followed the killing of five herders in Rawu village earlier. Reports indicated that bandits in Niger State’s Rafi local government area slaughtered 25 farmers and kidnapped several women and girls from different areas. The incident affected five communities. On Sunday, July 2, Taraba State Governor, Agbu Kefas, imposed a 24-hour curfew on Karim town and its surroundings in the Karim Lamido Local Government Area. The curfew followed a communal clash between the Wurkuns and the Karimjos in the area, where at least 50 people died. On Saturday, July 8, a total of 24 people were killed when armed men entered the Zaki Akpuuna 1 and Diom towns in the Mbaterem district of the Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State. A further look at the data from SBM Intelligence revealed that people were killed by non-state actors between May 29 and May 31, 541 in June, and 50 as of July 13. On March 14, 2024, for instance, 16 Nigerian soldiers lost their lives to attacks in the Okuama community of Delta State. ‘2,423 killed, 1,872 abducted’ In January 2024, some civil society groups, under the aegis of the Civil Society Joint Action Group, said 2,423 persons had been killed, while 1,872 others had been abducted in the eight months since President Bola Tinubu’s administration began. The groups asked the President to declare a state of emergency on insecurity and prosecute the 400 sponsors of terrorism arrested under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a joint press conference, the groups, numbering about 50, expressed concern about the state of insecurity in the country, following a spate of bandits’ attacks, killings, and abductions across the country, including the Federal Capital Territory. Speaking on behalf of the group, the Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre, Auwal Rafsanjani, said insecurity had persisted over the last three administrations, with 24,816 Nigerians killed and 15,597 persons abducted in the last administration of President (Mahammadu) Buhari, between 2019 and 2023. “It has now been eight months since President Tinubu took his oath of office and yet, things have failed to improve. Our tracking shows at least 2,423 people have been killed in mass atrocities-related incidents and at least 1,872 persons were abducted since the beginning of President Tinubu’s administration till January 26, 2024. “We are particularly concerned about the upsurge in abductions, noting that at least 230 incidents, in which multiple victims were involved, occurred within the first two weeks of January 2024 alone,” he said. In its 12-point recommendation to the government, the groups asked the government to “declare a state of emergency on kidnapping and other forms of terrorism, uncover and prosecute those responsible for the misappropriation of the $460m earmarked for the provision of Closed-Circuit Television cameras in the Federal Capital Territory, and to create a register of victims of abductions and other forms of mass atrocities.” Northern senators lament In March, senators from the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, under the aegis of Northern Senators’ Forum, decried the raging wave of killings and kidnapping in the North and urged decisive action to stop the trend. In a statement by their chairman, Senator Abdulaziz Yar’Adua, APC, Katsina Central, the senators said they would not rest until the security situation was brought under control and the perpetrators brought to justice. The statement read in part, “The distressing state of affairs concerning the recent wave of violence and kidnappings in the North is a major concern to the Northern Senators Forum. “The series of events that have unfolded in Kaduna State, beginning with the kidnapping of 286 students and staff from a school on March 7, the despicable attack on worshippers in a mosque on March 8, the abduction of 61 more persons on March 12, followed by 14 individuals on March 17, and a staggering total of 87 individuals in Kajuru on March 18, among others, are not only reprehensible but demand urgent and resolute action.” In an assessment of the President’s first year in office, a one-time member of the House of Representatives and elder statesman, Dr Usman Bugaje, accused the administration of lack of progress in addressing the nation’s pressing issues. During an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Wednesday, Bugaje was asked about the government’s decision to mark Tinubu’s first year in office with a low-key approach, without any fanfare. In his response, Bugaje said, “Well, as Citizens and as people who have been in government, clearly the last year has been a tragedy. Simple. There is not one problem they have been able to solve, so I cannot see anything other than low-key. “I mean, I give them the sense that they are feeling the pressure, they can see the faces of Nigerians and so perhaps they are trying to see how they can assuage this anger because the people are angry.” Expressing concern over the government’s inability to address the country’s challenges, Bugaje stated, “Since this administration came one year ago, I’ve not seen one problem that they have solved. “If anything, the policies they started with have created far more problems than they found, and in this one year, they are clearly groping in the dark Highlighting the importance of measurable metrics in evaluating governance, Bugaje expressed disappointment and accused the government of a lack of a baseline established. “We as a nation should have by now developed metrics for evaluating governance. In the academic cycle, there are, and there are statistics. Every government should have come up with a baseline. “After one year, they will be able to say scientifically this is the production in terms of agriculture, what we found in 2023, and this last season we have improved by some metric tons. In the field of security, these are the figures we would have improved,” added. The victories However, the Minister of Defence, Muhammad Badaru, on Thursday, said the military killed over 9,300 bandits and insurgents in the last year under President Tinubu. He also said the service chiefs had been working closely against what was obtained in the past. According to him, this has increased their productivity and translated into laudable achievements in the last year. Speaking at the ministerial sectorial update in Abuja, Badaru noted that the synergy among the service chiefs and sister agencies led to the killing of over 9,300 bandits and insurgents, while 7,000 had so far been arrested in the last year. He said, “We have also recovered 4,882 assorted weapons and 83,900 assorted ammunition in just one year. Among those that we naturalised are bandits that you hear. We have neutralised not less than 20 bandit leaders that command armies of insurgents and terrorists in just one year.” Experts weigh in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation and fourth-largest economy is grappling with a persistent and multifaceted insecurity crisis that has left countless lives devastated. Killings and abductions have become tragically routine, affecting every corner of the country. This crisis, fuelled by a complex web of factors, demands a thorough examination and a concerted effort from all sectors of society to address its root causes and find lasting solutions. The insecurity in Nigeria is multifaceted, according to a renowned Sociology professor in the Department of Sociology, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State, Iheriohanma Ekeoma. Ekeoma explained that it is a combination of factors including economic disparity, political instability, ethnic tensions, and climate change. He said, “Nigeria’s economic inequality is stark, with a significant portion of the population living in poverty. This economic hardship fuels criminal activities as individuals and groups turn to banditry, kidnapping, and other forms of violence to survive. “Nigeria’s political landscape is often marred by corruption, weak governance, and a lack of accountability. This instability undermines efforts to address security challenges effectively. For instance, funds allocated for security purposes are frequently misappropriated, leaving security agencies ill-equipped to tackle the threats.” Speaking on ethnic tensions, the professor said, “Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups, and tensions between these groups often result in violence. “Disputes over land, resources, and political power have led to deadly clashes, particularly between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers. The middle-belt region, including states like Benue and Plateau, has been a hotspot for such conflicts.” A security expert, Jackson Lekan-Ojo, said President Bola Tinubu has a lot of work to do as he enters his second year in government. He identified terrorism as a major fuel of insecurity in the country, stressing that the armed forces must do all within their powers to stamp out terrorists in the country. Also speaking, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu, said the human toll of Nigeria’s insecurity crisis was immense. “According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, over two million Nigerians are internally displaced, with many living in dire conditions in camps across the country. “The psychological impact of this violence is profound. Survivors of attacks often suffer from trauma and mental health issues, with little access to support services. Children are particularly vulnerable, as many have witnessed horrific violence or have been abducted and forced to join militant groups,” Ikechukwu added.",

        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m.",

        "description": "In 2019, Health Canada published an updated version of Canada's Food Guide. Its recommendations include drinking more water, eating more plant-based proteins, limiting the intake of highly processed foods, and cooking more meals at home.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Martin Lasalle, University of Montreal In 2019, Health Canada published an updated version of Canada's Food Guide. Its recommendations include drinking more water, eating more plant-based proteins, limiting the intake of highly processed foods, and cooking more meals at home. During the three-year review process, major Canadian agri-food players used a range of strategies to oppose the changes. In all, they conducted 366 corporate political activities (i.e. lobbying efforts) of which 82 (22%) involved criticizing the scientific data on which Health Canada based its recommendations and 76 (21%) involved submitting non-peer-reviewed, cherry-picked industry-friendly data. Those are the findings of a study published in the December 2023 issue of Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada . Lead author Marie-Chantal Robitaille is a master's student at Université de Montréal supervised by Jean-Claude Moubarac, a professor in the Department of Nutrition. Health Canada set up a committee to review the scientific literature and hold public consultations in order to update Canada's Food Guide on the basis of three guiding principles. To ensure transparency and avoid conflicts of interest, representatives of the food industry and industry-funded experts and scientists were excluded from the consultations. \"This decision by Health Canada was supported by the scientific literature and the World Health Organization, which has found that public-private collaboration can undermine the focus on the public interest and make it more difficult to establish public health policies ,\" said Robitaille. The previous version of the food guide was considered outdated by many health professionals, who criticized it as \"ineffective and lacking in credibility because it had become a marketing tool for certain products,\" she noted. Although excluded from the public consultations, food industry players expressed their views about the guidelines by submitting 11 briefs to the House Standing Committee on Health. Robitaille combed through these briefs and the websites of the 11 organizations that submitted them to survey their corporate political activities. Her analysis revealed four main strategies: \"I started by identifying the corporate political activities carried out by biofood industry players to influence the development of Canada's Food Guide and then documented and analyzed their discourses and positions on Health Canada's three guiding principles and the recommendations,\" Robitaille explained. Three organizations accounted for the bulk of the 366 examples of corporate political activity Robitaille found: Dairy Farmers of Canada (24%), the Canadian Juice Council, which also represents manufacturers of sweetened beverages and soft drinks (20%), and the National Cattle Feeder's Association (16%). The most common practices were information management (197 examples, or 53.8%) and discursive strategies (108 examples, or 29.5%). Within the information management category, the most frequently used strategy was suppressing information, which consisted mainly of criticizing the scientific evidence and emphasizing its complexity and uncertainty (98 examples or 27%). Robitaille pointed to the Egg Farmers of Canada brief, which argued that \"consultation and dialogue with both food producers and health professionals is an important step to ensure a balance of opinions are heard throughout the process.\" Similarly, the Canadian Meat Council maintained that it should be consulted because \"it had extensive expertise in nutrition and science, as well as experience in consumer education.\" According to Robitaille, the pressure from the agri-food industry on the committee charged with revising Canada's Food Guide and on Health Canada had no effect. \"This is a positive for Canada compared with other countries, where the food industry has succeeded in exerting considerable influence,\" said Robitaille. \"Studies show that the same strategies have been used in other jurisdictions, most notably in the United States, where companies banded together in 2010 to 2012 to fight government efforts to combat obesity.\" According to the article, one of the industry's main tactics was to \"exaggerate the cost of the proposed changes, using an alarmist narrative suggesting that the proposed recommendations will fail and that many undesirable health and economic problems will affect the whole of society.\" Principle No. 1: A variety of nutritious foods and beverages is the foundation for healthy eating. Health Canada recommends: Principle No. 2: Processed or prepared foods and beverages high in sodium, sugars or saturated fat undermine healthy eating. Health Canada recommends: Principle No. 3: Knowledge and skills are needed to navigate the complex food environment and support healthy eating.

        "content": "Researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) are investigating the effects ellagic acid, an antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, could have on halting and potentially reversing the damage caused by fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the physiological manifestation of obesity in the liver. The prevalence of NAFLD has increased from 25.24% in 2015 to 29.38% in 2021, and this condition now accounts for 45.8% of all cases of chronic-liver-disease-related deaths worldwide. There currently exists no treatment for the long-term management of NAFLD; however, dietary interventions have been investigated for the treatment of this disease, including several polyphenolic compounds such as ellagic acid. ECU researcher Dr. Lois Balmer and Ph.D. student Mrs. Tharani Senavirathna noted that ellagic acid, which is found in a variety of food such as raspberries , pomegranate , blackberries, and pecan nuts, is widely recognized for its antioxidant properties, but also exhibits anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and anticancer properties. The paper is published in the journal Antioxidants . \"Ellagic acid stands out as a remarkable polyphenolic compound, possessing a wide range of pharmacological properties that hold promise in treating various chronic diseases, including NAFLD. \"Due to its multifaceted biological effects, edible plants containing ellagic acid, and its derivatives are recognized as valuable functional foods for enhancing human health. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that ellagic acid, when combined with other antioxidant nutraceuticals, exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect, making it a potential candidate for combination therapy .\" Mrs. Senavirathna was involved in a previously undertaken pilot study investigating the effects of several polyphenolic compounds on NAFLD, with ellagic acid showing the most promise in reducing inflammation. A larger study is now under way which will also investigate at which point of the illness treatment would be ineffective to reverse damage to the liver.

        "content": "DALLAS — Bleach blonde, bad built, butch body. Has such alliteration and only six words ever jolted Congress as much? In our latest episode of Y’all-itics, U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas, explains why she chose not to sit there quietly after Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, attacked her physical appearance. “Until people decide that they want to elect serious lawmakers, this is the space that we’re functioning in. I chose to defend myself because when I went to Congress, I didn’t go to Congress to be anyone’s doormat,” Congresswoman Crockett told us. “To me, it’s hard to tell my district that I will stand up and I will fight for your rights, and I will fight for you, and sometimes that means even fighting for some of their lives, and I don’t even stand up and fight for myself.” It all started during a routine House Oversight Committee meeting where lawmakers were deciding whether to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress. Rep. Greene said Rep. Crockett’s “fake eyelashes” might be getting in the way of the Democrat’s ability to read and understand. In response, Crockett referred to Greene with the phrase “bleach blonde, bad built, butch body.” The moment quickly went viral, almost before lawmakers had even left the meeting. “One of the reasons that I think what I said really took off is because people were ready to attack the bully,” Crockett said on Y’all-itics. “Democrats and Republicans alike were like thank you, finally somebody to like, you know, shut this bully down. Crockett tells us she has neither seen nor spoken with Greene since the hearing. For her response, Congresswoman Greene posted a video on Instagram of her working out and defending her physique, saying she’s nearly 50 and she hopes to continue to “lift, run, swim, play sports, surf, ski, climb and LIVE this life to the fullest and enjoy every single moment!” Congresswoman Crocket has filed to trademark the phrase , now known as “B6.” But she clarified to us that it was her campaign, not her personally, and they’ll use the money to help other candidates across all levels of government. And to anyone arguing she should not have taken the bait, and chosen the proverbial high road instead, Crockett says this is a different time with different politics, and the new generation of Democrats have a different approach. “Right now, we can’t get a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act because we have been coopted by people that, literally, don’t believe in diversity, equity, or inclusion, affirmative action. Like, we’re turning back the hands of time on repro. Like, we have a different machine that has pulled in,” said the Democrat.",

        "content": "This positive development was revealed in the MAN CEO’s Confidence Index Report (MCCI) for Q1’24, released recently. The MCCI serves as an index to gauge changes in the quarterly outlook of CEOs of manufacturing firms concerning government policies and macroeconomic indicators. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, Director General of MAN, commented on the report, stating, “The moderate improvement in the Aggregate Index Score (AIS), from 51.8 points to 53.5 points, signifies a positive shift in the manufacturing sector’s sentiment. This suggests a trajectory towards restoration and recovery, potentially reaching levels observed in Q3 2022, with optimism for further improvement in the coming quarter.” He attributed this improvement to the resilience of manufacturers, recent gains made by the Naira, anticipated reduction in diesel prices, and expectations regarding the seamless disbursement of presidential intervention funds for the sector. However, Ajayi-Kadir cautioned that despite these positive indicators, emerging policies may pose challenges to this optimism. Highlighting the significance of the manufacturing sector in driving economic growth and fostering prosperity, Ajayi-Kadir emphasized the need for the government to prioritize the sector by providing necessary policy support and incentives.

        "content": "At the recently held Coca-Cola 600 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, NFL QB Lamar Jackson made a surprise appearance. The Ravens superstar per reports was at the NASCAR event to support the defending champion Ryan Blaney. While the race was called off due to bad weather, Lamar managed to make it to the news thanks to his surprise and albeit awkward encounter with one of Daniel Suarez’s pit crew members. The two-time NFL MVP is a superstar in most rooms he enters into. The Coca-Cola 600 event was no different. Hence it was natural that crew members of multiple drivers wanted a picture and pleasantry with the NFL superstar. The Ravens QB shook hands with multiple crew members. However, something strange happened during Lamar’s interaction with Daniel Suarez’s entourage. After shaking hands with three pit members, Lamar greeted the fourth with a side hug and a handshake that lasted an eternity. Jokes aside, the handshake awkwardly lasted for a few extra moments reaching a weird territory. While the duo did seem like they were talking about something, the constant handshake while talking certainly felt weird to the fans. NFL fans hence took to social media to react. The initial fan reaction fully focused on the awkwardness of the handshake. A few fans also noted how the pit crew member would have been praying to get his hands free. All said and done, while the handshake did go on for a tad too long, the pit crew member wasn’t a stranger to Lamar at all. In fact, the pit crew member turned out to be Lamar’s senior from college. Lamar Jackson Reunites With College Senior Punter At NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 The pit crew member that Lamar shook hands with was none other than Joshua Appleby, a former punter at the University of Louisville . Since the Ravens QB also graduated from the same university, the two have a connection from their alma mater. Appleby and Lamar however never got to play together as the QB’s freshman season [2015] was a year later than the kicker’s final season [2014] at Louisville. Despite not playing, they surely must have had some bond back then which translated to the meeting yesterday. A few netizens upon being privy to this information were surprised that a former kicker is now part of NASCAR. However, it’s actually a very common migratory path for countless football athletes who fail to make it to the NFL. Pit stop efficiency in racing is a big metric. Being a pit crew member is a highly physical job that can only be undertaken by athletic bodies. With alternate football leagues not picking up steam, many NFL rejects thus ply their trade in NASCAR, leveraging their athletic builds. All said it was beautiful seeing two friends meeting after so long. Handshake aside, the meeting must have surely stirred a few college memories in the duo’s heads.",

This means that even more people living with the disease will be able to use this life-changing app. For the first time, the FDA authorized the use of the artificial pancreas system in pregnancy. CamAPS FX, produced by Cambridge spinout company CamDiab, is an Android app that can be used to help manage glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes, including during pregnancy. The app allows a compatible insulin pump and a compatible continuous glucose monitor to 'talk to each other,\" creating an artificial pancreas. The CamAPS FX closed loop algorithm was given FDA authorization on Thursday 23 May. It had already been CE-marked for use in the UK and the EU. CamAPS FX creator Roman Hovorka is Professor of Metabolic Technology at the Institute of Metabolic Science and Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, where the technology was developed. He said, \"We set out to help people with type 1 diabetes and their families live better lives and we're delighted that the FDA has reviewed the safety and effectiveness of CamAPS FX and has given the technology its approval.\" \"It has been extensively tested and we're proud that it is considered by many to be the best algorithm out there.\" CamAPS FX is already used by more than 27,000 people in 15 countries across Europe and Australia. Artificial pancreas systems such as CamAPS FX have been granted approval for wide use by the NHS in November 2023 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).",

        "content": "The College of Southern Nevada’s baseball team appeared to have things under control through six innings Monday. Florence-Darlington Tech (South Carolina) had other plans. Tyman Long and Jet Gilliam hit home runs to lead CSN, but the Coyotes gave up a six-run lead in the late innings to fall to the Stingers 9-8 in their second-round game of the National Junior College Athletic Association World Series at Grand Junction, Colorado. The loss dropped the ninth-seeded Coyotes (52-11) to the losers bracket. They will play an elimination game against No. 5 Crowder (Missouri) at 9 a.m. Tuesday. “It’s tough losing those types of games,” CSN coach Nick Garritano said. “(Florence-Darlington Tech) just did a great job on the offensive side and they kept chipping away. They just kept hitting the ball where we weren’t.” The eighth-seeded Stingers (53-10) got on the board first with a second-inning solo home run by Zack Hunt off Coyotes starter Naun Haro. Long, whose 10th-inning homer against Northwest Florida State College lifted the Coyotes to victory Saturday, belted a three-run blast in the third inning to put CSN ahead 3-1. Florence-Darlington Tech cut its deficit to 3-2 in the fourth. CSN responded by tacking on two more runs in the fifth. The Coyotes then extended their lead to 8-2 in the sixth thanks to a two-run homer by Gilliam and an RBI single by Garrison Geis. “It was a great feeling to know we had the thing in hand,” Garritano said. “But we did lose some opportunities in the early and middle innings that could have made the difference.” Haro’s effectiveness on the mound waned in the bottom of the sixth. Florence-Darlington Tech got within 8-5 with the help of a two-run double by Mac James. A trio of CSN relievers fared no better in the eighth. The Stingers jumped ahead 9-8 with four runs on three hits and an error. “I’m the head coach and I’ve got to make the right decisions,” Garritano said. “I trust my pitchers, but they’re kids and you’ve got to give credit to a really good team.” Michael Cruz went 2-for-3 with an RBI to help CSN. Tyler Ray (0-1) suffered the loss. “Our backs will be against the wall tomorrow,” Garritano said. “So, we’ll see what we’re made of. We’ve been in the losers bracket before and we’re going to play hard for nine innings.”",

        "content": "By PA Sport Staff Marcus Rashford is planning to take some time to reset mentally after acknowledging he has endured a “challenging season”. The England forward was left out of Gareth Southgate’s training squad for Euro 2024 after scoring just eight goals in all competitions for a struggling Manchester United side who finished eighth in the Premier League. But after helping his club end the season on a high by beating Manchester City in Saturday’s FA Cup final, the 26-year-old will now look to make the most of his summer of rest. It’s time to come off Socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together. 🙏🏾 — Marcus Rashford (@MarcusRashford) May 27, 2024 And as he announced his decision to step away from his social media accounts for a few weeks, Rashford – who last month said “enough is enough” after receiving online abuse – responded again to his critics. He wrote on X: “It’s time to come off socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. “Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t, just remember at United, we always stick together.” Team-mate Luke Shaw did make Southgate’s provisional squad despite injuries restricting him to only 15 appearances for United this season, the last of them in February. The full-back has addressed criticism over his apparent availability for his country, but not his club. A post shared by Luke Shaw (@lukeshaw23) Shaw posted on Instagram: “I don’t normally react to things I see on social media, but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. “The reality is I am not 100 per cent fit for either right now, but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. “I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.” Meanwhile, team-mate Anthony Martial bade an emotional farewell to the club after confirming his nine-year stay at Old Trafford was over. The 28-year-old France international joined the Red Devils in a £36million move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on Instagram, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "description": "A three-day recap of the best and worst of Boston Calling 2024, from the scintillating sets to the overwhelming Sunday crowds.The post Boston Calling 2024 review: The best and worst moments of the festival appeared first on Boston.com.",
        "content": "By Leading up to , which took over the Harvard Athletic Complex Memorial Day weekend, I was nagged by a persistent question: Who, exactly, is Boston Calling for in 2024? The answer has undoubtedly evolved since the festival first dazzled audiences on a cold, rainy weekend at City Hall Plaza 11 years ago. That first edition, headlined by festival curator Aaron Dessner’s band The National, featured almost 100 percent bands that fell somewhere on the indie rock spectrum — a reflection of festival co-founders Brian Appel and Mike Snow’s origins at independent radio station WFNX and defunct alt-weekly the Boston Phoenix . But times and tastes change, and Boston Calling has changed along with them. What was once indie becomes mainstream, what was mainstream becomes retro, and what didn’t exist until six months ago is the hottest thing on the planet. Dessner, a force in the indie rock world, has worked extensively as a producer for Taylor Swift, the most popular pop star of this generation — and quite possibly any generation, if she keeps breaking records. And since moving to Harvard Athletic Complex in 2017, Boston Calling has grown in capacity and ambition, landing stadium-level talents like Metallica in 2022 and Swift collaborator Ed Sheeran this year. Change can be a good thing. Stars revered by Gen Z and Gen Alpha like Reneé Rapp and Chappell Roan were some of the highlights of Boston Calling 2024, and Megan Thee Stallion delivered arguably the most high-powered rap set at the festival since Travis Scott in 2019. That’s not to say the festival has abandoned its roots, either. Young The Giant, who played the very first Boston Calling, were back again this year. So too was Frank Turner, who played the May 2014 festival, and the Killers, who didn’t play Boston Calling until 2018, but would have easily fit in the rock-heavy early lineups. The answer, then, to the question of who Boston Calling is for? It’s for everyone. It has always been for high schoolers and college kids who go with 10 of their best friends to see their favorite artists. It’s also for twenty- and thirty-somethings who now make enough money to pay festival prices to see their favorite bands from high school or college for a weekend. Most of all, it’s for music lovers of any age who possess an open mind and an adventurous spirit. I had only a vague awareness of Chappell Roan’s music heading into the weekend, but by the end of her set on Sunday, I was a convert. Similarly, one of my college-aged coworkers was unfamiliar with Trey Anastasio, but came away impressed by the Phish guitarist and his Classic Tab band’s jam-heavy Saturday night performance. In honor of my colleague Chad Finn, whose unconventional reviews are a must-read after every Patriots game, here’s my unconventional review of Boston Calling 2024. For the first few hours on Friday, you could easily move around the festival grounds. Then came time for Reneé Rapp’s 5:55 set, and suddenly the crowd swelled, with young fans filling the Green Stage area to support the “Mean Girls” star. Beyond typical festival fashion, the most common accessory was an Ed Sheeran merchandise. The English singer-songwriter has consistently filled Gillette Stadium, and the T-shirts from previous editions of the Math tours made it look like a physics conference. Rapp made her apologies for the song “I Hate Boston” early and often. The Broadway singer turned pop star first clarified that the track was about a “trying time” she had in the city with some exes. When she got to the lyrics “As far as I’m concerned, they should just burn the whole city down,” she quickly added, “That’s not true anymore!” Not that her fans needed convincing, weren’t part of Saturday’s country-influenced lineup, but the Americana/roots rock trio from Hyde Park would have fit right in. Check out their latest single “ ,” or their most popular song “ ” for a taste. For the second year in a row, Dunkin’s two-story lounge was the hit of the festival. Two separate lines – one for the ground floor, one for the balcony — were each longer than the queues for every other concession, as fans waited for free coffee, gift cards, temporary tattoos, and other Dunkin’ goodness. Leading up to the festival’s first-ever country headliner, Tyler Childers, Saturday’s lineup had country or country-adjacent acts on every stage. Walking to the Blue Stage for a 5:50 set from The Red Clay Strays, there was a noticeable change in the crowd’s aesthetic from Friday. Fans in Luke Bryan T-shirts and American flag cowboy hats lined up for the ferris wheel. A couple in matching Bass Pro Shop tank tops edged toward the front of the stage. Two guys in Alabama Crimson Tide shirts spit chewing tobacco into (hopefully) empty Miller Lite cans. For a day, Boston Calling had gone country. Not that Red Clay Strays frontman Brandon Coleman saw it that way: He considers the Mobile, Ala. group to be rock ‘n roll. (Perhaps he’s onto something, as the group will be opening for the Rolling Stones at Gillette Stadium later this week.) The other distinct demo at Saturday’s shows were jam band fans, who gathered en masse for a set from Phish lead guitarist Trey Anastasio on the Red Stage. Grateful Dead tees, gray dreads, and barefoot dance circles made for a festive atmosphere. People at the Trey Anastasio set who want to dance barefoot are using the faux Green Monster as a makeshift shoe check-in like we’re at a bowling alley and I love it On the Green Stage, Khruangbin played a mesmerizing, largely instrumental set of groovy tunes, with one track melding into another. The repeated chorus of “ ” — “That’s life / If we had more time, we could live forever” — felt like a zen koan mantra, putting the the swaying crowd under the trio’s spell. My favorite local discovery of the weekend was , a five-piece indie band formed in 2019 by a group of Berklee students. Singer Alli Raina showcased haunting, otherworldly vocals with a cover of Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit” and on “ ,” the powerful closing track on the band’s 2023 EP “Traveling Exploding Star.” In terms of paying respect to the festival’s Harvard confines, Red Bull deserves some kudos for reviving Out of Town News to hand out free energy drinks to the music-loving masses. Dunkin Lounge gets all the press, but low-key my favorite brand activation at Boston Calling is the Red Bull one designed like the defunct Out Of Town newsstand in Harvard Square. I’ve been to every single Boston Calling, and I’ve never seen the festival more crowded than it was on Sunday, which was the only day that sold out. The number I heard from a few different festival sources was 40,000 people (compared to only 16,000 on Saturday), but it felt like even more than that. Part of the reason the grounds felt so oppressively crowded was that almost all of those 40,000 people were already in place to see Chappell Roan on the Green Stage at 4:05 p.m. The festival has a history of putting up-and-coming acts in a midday slot, which is a cool way to let fans say they saw a future headliner “before they got big.” Noah Kahan, who is set to perform multiple sold-out dates at Fenway Park this summer, played at around the same time last year, for example. But the consequence of Sunday’s schedule was almost no one left the area surrounding the Green and Red Stages for seven consecutive hours. There was a brief surge for concessions after Roan finished her set, but by the time Megan Thee Stallion walked onto the Green Stage at 6:25, many people were essentially stuck in place. Logistics that worked seamlessly on Friday and Saturday were suddenly overrun. Staff began handing out $5 waters freely to the crowds, but the number of overheated concertgoers who needed medical assistance – which is something that happens at every outdoor music festival, to be clear – spiked. Meanwhile, I swung by the Blue Stage on the opposite end of the grounds a few times, and despite great bands like Blondshell and Alvvays playing, there was never more than a few hundred people there. The performances throughout Sunday were some of the best all weekend, but as comments on Boston Calling’s social media accounts ( ) showed, the crowds were a problem. In honor of all the free water they handed out on a day when it was sorely needed, it’s got to be Liquid Death, which had a macabre country club full of skulls, grim reapers, and a casket full of new flavored waters. After being unable to negotiate the crowd to see the start of Hozier, I encountered the heaviest music of the weekend from Fleshwater, a hardcore band part of the broader . You could argue the real answer is Chappell Roan (and you can read my colleague Heather Alterisio’s ), but letting my extreme millennial bias show, I have to pick The Killers. Brandon Flowers and co. are old pros at this point, having played the exact same stage in 2018 and currently touring on the back of a greatest hits album. Songs like “All These Things That I’ve Done,” “Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,” and “Somebody Told Me” had the crowd singing along to every word. Ever the showman, Flowers waited until the very end to deliver the band’s biggest hits, finishing with “When You Were Young,” then coming back for an encore of “Human” and “Mr. Brightside.” 🎶“Somebody Told Me” — The Killers (ft.

        "description": "Here are two of the best TSX stocks from the consumer discretionary sector you can buy today and hold for the long term.The post Best Stocks to Buy in May 2024: TSX Consumer Discretionary Sector appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "The consumer discretionary or the consumer cyclical sector makes up roughly around 3.6% of the . This sector includes shares of companies that sell goods and services that are considered non-essential, including automobiles, clothing, and leisure. This is one of the key reasons why the performance of this sector is largely linked to the state of the economy and consumer confidence, as consumers tend to spend more on these items when they have higher incomes and strong optimism. While high interest rates and inflationary pressures have affected consumer spending of late, the central banks in the United States and Canada are expected to slash interest rates multiple times in the near term, which could revitalize consumer confidence and spending. This factor could also boost the performance of many TSX . Given that, it could be the right time to look for some attractive consumer discretionary stocks to buy in May 2024. In this article, I’ll highlight three such Canadian stocks that have strong and growth prospects. Magna stock ( ) is the first consumer discretionary stock on the that I believe could witness a strong recovery as economic conditions improve. This Aurora-headquartered automotive supplier and mobility company currently has a of $17.7 billion as its stock trades at $61.97 per share after sliding by 20% so far in 2024. At this market price, MG stock also offers a decent 4.2% annualized dividend yield. In the last 12 months ended in March, Magna’s total revenue 10.9% YoY (year over year) to US$43.1 billion. More importantly, the company’s adjusted earnings during this period surged by 37% YoY to US$5.37 per share due mainly to its continued focus on cost initiatives, productivity, and efficiency improvements. Despite its positive financial growth trends, Magna stock has slid by nearly 49% over the last three years as the ongoing macroeconomic challenges and a weak consumer spending environment have weighed heavily on the automotive industry. However, as early signs of easing inflationary pressures point towards potential rate cuts, the automotive sector may be one of the first to benefit, in my opinion, making Magna’s current valuation appear attractive for long-term investors. Canada Goose stock ( ) is another attractive TSX consumer discretionary stock you may want to buy now and hold for the next decade. This Toronto-headquartered performance luxury apparel firm currently has a market cap of $1.8 billion as its stock trades at $19.12 per share with nearly 23% year-to-date gains. In its fiscal year 2024 (ended in March), Canada Goose’s sales climbed by 9.6% YoY to $1.3 billion with the help of higher retail sales and strategic collaborations. Its adjusted earnings during the fiscal year, however, fell 5.7% YoY to $0.99 per share due partly to higher expenses related to retail network expansion and a decline in operating income. Despite these challenges, Canada Goose’s long-term growth outlook appears strong as the company continues to focus on expanding its global store network and strengthening its product range beyond traditional categories. These positive factors could help GOOS stock continue soaring and yield strong returns in the long run.",

        "content": "A WAILING mother held her four-year-old daughter's tiny hand for the last time after her heart was pierced by shrapnel from one of Putin's missiles. Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago. Moscow has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukrainian children , especially through its illegal deportation of children into Russia. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes against kids. In Kharkiv, another frontline city and the focus of Russia's new offensive , The Sun watched as a Ukrainian soldier wedded his sweetheart before heading to fight. The number of couples tying the knot in the bomb-blitzed region rose by 11 per cent to 10,977 as troops fear they might not make it back. It comes as Ukraine carried out its deepest ever drone strike 1,120 miles inside Russia. The attack targeted radar systems and even buzzed close to Putin's £1billion Black Sea fortress palace as it hit infrastructure nearby.",

        "description": "Some legal challenges faced by publicly traded companies should be perceived as opportunities by investors since they can discount the stock and boost its yield. The post Money-Laundering Investigation: Is TD Bank Stock in Trouble? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Almost all publicly traded companies are vulnerable to regulatory challenges and legal problems, but financial institutions are more vulnerable due to the nature of their business. This is evident from the money-laundering allegations and investigation ( ) is currently dealing with in the U.S. It’s one of the trading on the TSX and one of Canada’s largest publicly traded companies, which has taken a significant dive while battling regulatory issues and a money-laundering investigation. The money-laundering investigation Earlier this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) in the U.S. initiated a probe into TD Bank after it came to light that millions of dollars connected to the Fentanyl trade in the U.S., particularly in New York and New Jersey, came through TD Bank. This drug connection and the investigation it triggered caused the stock to dip quite a bit in a handful of days. It has recovered from the original dip, but the money-laundering investigation in the U.S. and the regulatory concerns it’s raising back home in Canada are keeping the stock grounded as the financial sector goes up. The amount of money allegedly laundered through TD is enormous — over US$653 million. The bank is already taking steps to resolve the vulnerabilities and exposure it has and has also reportedly set aside around $500 million for penalties after this investigation. However, the most significant factor to take into account here is that the investigation isn’t over yet. If, in addition to the significant financial penalties, the bank also experiences some deregulation or is forced to invest an exuberant amount in its anti-money-laundering systems, the stock might dip significantly harder than it did at the beginning of this probe. Is the TD Bank stock in trouble? In a word, yes. While most Canadian have started to slump recently, TD has been going down for weeks. It’s trading at a discount of about 30% from its 2022 peak. This discount has resulted in a decent bump in the yield, making it 5.4%. The valuation is also healthy, but the uncertainty is unsuitable for the stock’s prospects. While the chances of it seem relatively slim, if the bank is acquitted of these charges and gets no penalty, it may spike. However, even though it may recover investor confidence, the erosion of consumer confidence, especially in the U.S. (if it’s reflected in the bank’s earnings reports), may impact its long-term growth. Foolish takeaway From a dividend investor perspective, TD Bank may seem very lucrative, especially considering its history as an aristocrat. You can buy now or wait for the verdict of the investigation. If it’s negative, the stock may dip further, and you might have a chance to lock in an even more compelling yield.",

Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago.

        "description": "Ryan Fox played alongside Grayson Murray last week.",
        "content": "WARNING: This story deals with suicide. Please see below for help and crisis information. Kiwi world number 63 Ryan Fox has paid tribute to PGA Tour player Grayson Murray who took his own life after withdrawing from the Charles Schwab Cup event over the weekend. Fox played alongside Murray during the third round at last week’s PGA Championship and was in the Charles Schwab Cup field - finishing tied for 32nd. “A disappointing weekend for me @charles_schwab_challenge but it pales in comparison to what was a very sad weekend for the golfing world. I played with Grayson for the first time at the PGA last week and very much enjoyed his company and was impressed by his golf game. “I was heartbroken to hear the news yesterday and my thoughts are with his family and friends at this tragic time #ripgrayson” A post shared by Ryan Fox (@ryanfoxgolfer) Murray ’s parents released a statement yesterday confirming he took his own life. “We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone,” Eric and Terry Murray said in a statement. “It’s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It’s a nightmare. “... Life wasn’t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.” “We have so many questions that have no answers. But one. Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes,” his parents said in their statement. “By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and – it seems – by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. “We would like to thank the PGA Tour and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Please respect our privacy as we work through this incredible tragedy, and please honour Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else.” Murray’s management company, GSE Worldwide, confirmed the death and said it was heartbroken. “We will hold off on commenting until we learn further details, but our heart aches for his family, his friends and all who loved him during this very difficult time,” GSE said in a statement. Related articles 'A bizarre scenario': Fox reflects on PGA Championship death, Scheffler arrest Fire burns golf shop at beleagured Gulf Harbour Country Club 'Congrats, you're in the PGA': Young Kiwi set to make golf major debut PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said he spoke with Murray’s parents to offer condolences, and they asked that the tournament in Fort Worth, Texas, continue. Players wore red and black ribbons in the final round to honour Murray. World number one Scottie Scheffler finished second behind Davis Riley at the Charles Schwab Cup and talked about spending time with Murray last week. “Obviously it was a pretty difficult day to come out to the golf course with news of Grayson yesterday and, you know, spent that moment of silence today really just thinking about him and praying for his family and his fiance’, and obviously it was pretty difficult to come play golf,” Scheffler said. “But like his parents said, he would have wanted the tournament to continue. I got to know him fairly well over the last few months, shared a couple meals with him, played a couple practice rounds. I was with him for a few hours, he was at our rental house last week. It’s a tough day for all of us out here on Tour and we’re thinking about his family and we’re praying hard for them, for sure.” Players are wearing red and black ribbons on Sunday at the @CSChallengeFW to honor Grayson Murray. Murray wore the colors of his hometown Carolina Hurricanes, when competing on Sundays. His family requested that ribbons with the same colors be worn Sunday. ❤️🖤 pic.twitter.com/zS3V0pwW0N “To see the devastation on the faces of every player coming in is really difficult to see and really just profound,” Monahan said. “Grayson was a remarkable player, but he was a very courageous man. I’ve always loved that about him.” Murray, who had dealt with alcohol and mental health issues in the past, made a massive turnaround this year and won the Sony Open, hitting wedge to 3 feet for birdie on the final hole to get into a playoff and winning it with a 40-foot putt. He also won the Barbasol Championship in 2017. “It was a huge shock. My heart sank,” said Webb Simpson, who learned of Murray’s death shortly before teeing off at Colonial. He said Murray was the first winner of his junior tournament and they shared the same swing coach as juniors. “I just hate it so much,” Simpson said. “I’m going to miss him. I’m thankful he was in the place with his faith before this morning happened.” Murray was No 58 in the world rankings coming off a tie for 43rd in the PGA Championship last week at Valhalla. He also made the cut in his Masters debut, finishing 51st, and was in the field for the US Open next month at Pinehurst No 2. Murray, who grew up in North Carolina, was among the most talented juniors in the country. He won the prestigious Junior World Championship in San Diego three straight years and earned the Arnold Palmer Scholarship at Wake Forest. He wound up going to three colleges, lastly at Arizona State, and won as a 22-year-old PGA Tour rookie at the Barbasol Championship. Murray said in January that he had been sober for eight months, was engaged to be married, had become a Christian and felt his best golf was ahead of him. He was appointed to the 16-member Player Advisory Council. “My story is not finished. I think it’s just beginning,” Murray said in Hawaii. “I hope I can inspire a lot of people going forward that have their own issues.” Murray said he used to drink during tournament weeks as a rookie because he knew he had talent and felt he was invincible. He also brought attention to himself through social media, openly criticising other players and getting into one social media spat with Kevin Na over Na’s reputation as a slow player. But he felt like he turned the corner when he sought help – letting others fight for him, is how he explained it this year. “It took me a long time to get to this point,” Murray said in January. “That was seven years ago, over seven years ago. I’m a different man now. I would not be in this position right now today if I didn’t put that drink down eight months ago.” Peter Malnati played with Murray at Colonial. He offered to go on the CBS telecast Saturday afternoon and immediately broke down trying to talk about him. “It’s a huge loss for all of us on the PGA Tour,” Malnati said. “As much as we want to beat each other, we’re one big family, and we lost one today. It’s terrible.” Share this article",

Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago. Moscow has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukrainian children , especially through its illegal deportation of children into Russia. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes against kids. In Kharkiv, another frontline city and the focus of Russia's new offensive , The Sun watched as a Ukrainian soldier wedded his sweetheart before heading to fight. The number of couples tying the knot in the bomb-blitzed region rose by 11 per cent to 10,977 as troops fear they might not make it back. It comes as Ukraine carried out its deepest ever drone strike 1,120 miles inside Russia. The attack targeted radar systems and even buzzed close to Putin's £1billion Black Sea fortress palace as it hit infrastructure nearby.",

Karaliyadda entered Parliament representing the Anuradhapura district and has served as the Cabinet Minister for Child Development and Women’s Affairs, as well as the Minister of Indigenous Medicine.

At the time Karaliyadda denied any connection to Ranasinghe and the murder of de Zoysa in Anuradhapura.",

Via , Myers wrote: “Also, Textor is not on his own with regards to having an interest in buying the club.” Toffees fans have long awaited news of a change in ownership, as the tenure of Moshiri has been marked by significant discontent and the subsequent involvement of 777 Partners has only added to the turmoil. The potential takeover by Textor, a Crystal Palace co-owner, represents a beacon of hope for a fanbase that has grown increasingly disillusioned with the current leadership. The American’s interest suggests a serious intent to invest in the club and steer it towards a more stable and successful future. This is particularly welcome news in light of the failed takeover by 777 Partners, which has left the club in a state of uncertainty. The prospect of new ownership offers the promise of fresh investment, improved decision-making and a renewed sense of direction for the club. Also, Textor is not on his own with regards to having an interest in buying the club Moreover, the fact that Textor is not alone in his pursuit to buy the club is paramount as this could mean more investment and potentially a chance to take the club to the next level.

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "description": "Michael Dunlop fired in a 129mph lap to lead the Superbike times as the 2024 Isle of Man TT roared into life on Monday.",
        "content": "The Ballymoney man stands on the brink of history at the event, when two more wins would ensure he becomes the most successful rider ever at the legendary Mountain Course spectacle ahead of his uncle Joey. Dunlop is poised on 25 victories and made a strong start to practice week, which was delayed by four hours due to fog and wet roads after overnight rain. His 129.59mph lap on the Hawk Racing Honda was set from a standing start, with the 35-year-old’s time squeezing out Davey Todd on the Milwaukee BMW by only 0.114s, who lapped at 129.575mph on his second lap of the 37.73-mile Mountain Course. Peter Hickman, last year’s Senior TT winner, was third fastest after a lap of 128.721mph on the Monster Energy by FHO Racing BMW. Hickman, a 13-time TT winner, is nursing a hand injury after a crash-hit British Superbike round at Oulton Park prior to the North West 200. The 37-year-old said the gruelling nature of the TT course was taking its toll on his badly bruised left hand. “It is what it is,” said Hickman. “It’s bruised bones in my left hand and it’s probably worse than a break because it takes so long to get fixed, and it will be a couple of months before it’s normal. “It’s good it’s my left hand and not my right. I have full movement and strength but the biggest problem is pain – it just hurts. “It’s super bumpy here so it gets banged about,” he added. “Overall I’m happy enough and it’s steady away.” Honda Racing UK’s John McGuinness was fourth fastest in the Superbike class at 127.646mph, 8.8s back on Hickman, with team-mate Dean Harrison in fifth on the early leaderboard after lapping at 125.909mph. Young prospect James Hind had an impressive first night as he slotted into sixth on the North Lincs Components Suzuki ahead of James Hillier (WTF Racing Honda). Australian rider Josh Brookes had a lucky escape after hitting a bird at Bray Hill which completely shattered the screen of his FHO Racing BMW. Hickman set the pace in Superstock qualifying, lapping at 129.032mph to lead Dunlop by 1.322s after the Ballymoney man clocked 128.87mph on his MD Racing Honda. Dominic Herbertson was almost 11 seconds down on Dunlop after a solid start for Dungannon team Burrows Engineering/RK Racing on the BMW M1000RR. “This place is just amazing, how are we allowed to do this,” Herbertson exclaimed. “I’m with the Burrows team and I feel like a bit of spare part because I’m used to having a couple of mates with me and running around look for this and that, but now I just have to turn up and ride the bikes.” In the Supersport class, North West 200 winner Todd made a promising start on the Powertoolmate Ducati with a speed of 125.601mph after two laps, which put him 1.014s ahead of Hillier (Bournemouth Kawasaki). Dunlop, winner of the last four Supersport TT races, was a further 3.768s adrift on his new MD Racing Triumph after lapping at 125.048mph. Hind featured prominently again in fourth on the North Lincs Components Suzuki 750, almost five seconds behind Dunlop. Double NW200 Supertwin winner Hickman led the times in the class on the Swan Yamaha with a lap of 118mph. Todd was 19.3s behind on the Dafabet Kawasaki in second place, while Dunlop – a Supertwin TT winner last year – was forced out on his Paton machine at Greeba. In the Sidecar class, Ryan and Callum Crowe were fastest at 116.70mph from Ben Birchall and new passenger Kevin Rousseau (115.88mph). Practice is scheduled to continue on Tuesday evening, with roads closed from 6pm.",

        "description": "Former Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona has revealed she will be moving our of her £2million mansion next month with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney as her children fly the nest",
        "content": "As her children leave the nest for their own ventures, has announced she is moving out of her lavish house for a smaller property. The 43-year-old is looking to move out of her sprawling £2million Cheshire pad to settle into a more manageable home. The former Atomic Kitten has previously been travelling back and forth to Marbella with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney. But as her daughter Lilly-Sue, 21, and Heidi, 16, share their plans to move out of the family home, the mum-of-five and her beau have decided to stay in the North of England. In her exclusive column for OK! Magazine on Monday (May 27), the hitmaker confessed that despite moving out in June, she has not started packing up yet. She wrote: “We’re moving next month, and we haven’t packed a single thing. We are not prepared! I’m going to be really sad to leave this house, because it’s gorgeous and we really get along with our neighbours. It’s a shame. “But at the same time, I want a house to feel really homely and this one is just so big, I can’t keep on top of it.” She went on to add that she hopes in her smaller home “there will be less mess for me to tidy up after the kids.” Kerry added that her new home is “still close by for DJ’s school” and will be the perfect spot for her younger children. The TV favourite is the proud mother of five – Molly Marie and Lilly whom she shares with her ex-husband Brian McFadden. She also welcomed Heidi and Max from her marriage with taxi driver Mark Croft. The star gave birth to her youngest daughter DJ during her marriage with the late George Kay. The proud mum recently shared the news that Heidi, 21, had landed a sport a at a coveted music school in Ireland. The star later announced that 17-year-old Lilly would also be leaving home to move to Liverpool, where she is enrolled in a performing arts school. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for the happy couple since. Kerry hinted at trouble in paradise earlier this month when she moved in with her mother after she went under the knife. Earlier this month, Kerry decided to get a nose job which had been damaged by past drug abuse. In her column, the TV star thanked her mum for her continued support and “really looked after me” following her operation. She then admitted that she had felt “unsupported” by her other half who zipped down to London to get a tattoo at the time of her operation.

        "content": "Tanner Houck had another strong outing on Sunday, allowing one run in six innings to help the Red Sox beat the Brewers, 2-1, at Fenway Park in Boston. Steven Senne/Associated Press This was a good weekend to take stock in the Red Sox. Memorial Day is a signpost in the annual baseball season. We’re just about one-third of the way through the campaign. It’s a chance to assess a team and figure out where it stands. The simple answer is, we have no idea. Still. The Red Sox are 27-27 after an 11-3 loss to Baltimore on Monday, and in third place in the AL East. That’s better than most people expected from this team. It is also one full game behind where the Red Sox were through 54 games last year. No one is holding 2023 up as a standard worth repeating. One of the most impressive aspects of the Red Sox start has been their pitching. The Red Sox hit Memorial Day with the second-lowest ERA in the majors, but that has steadily crept up. Boston’s ERA is over 3.97 since mid-May, and Red Sox pitching ran into a buzzsaw over the weekend when the Brewers came to town. Milwaukee scored 13 runs in the first two games at Fenway, and showed an advanced approach against Red Sox pitchers. The Brewers refused to expand the strike zone and wouldn’t go after breaking pitches outside the strike zone. “They didn’t chase a whole lot, I noticed, like in some of my previous outings” starting pitcher Kutter Crawford told reporters after Boston’s 7-2 loss Friday. “They’re good hitters. They’ve got a good approach. They don’t chase a whole lot and make you get in the zone.” It was almost like the Brewers figured out the cheat code to break the spell Sox starters have been casting on major league hitters this spring. The plan of attack has been to throw fewer four-seam fastballs and to focus on breaking pitches with east-west movement. It has worked for the better part of two months. It worked well again on Sunday, when Tanner Houck lowered his ERA to 1.90 with six brilliant innings in a 2-1 win that saw tempers flare and benches empty in the seventh inning. The fire brought the Fenway crowd to life, as did Jarren Duran’s single an inning later that drove in the winning run. Jarren Duran drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning of the Red Sox’s 2-1 win over the Brewers on Sunday at Fenway Park in Boston. Boston improved to 9-0 on Sundays. Steven Senne/Associated Press The Sox are 9-0 on Sundays this season, and taking the final game of a weekend ensures you don’t get swept. Manager Alex Cora needs to start taking his team to church, or brunch, every morning to make that Sunday feeling a daily ritual. He also needs to get them to play better at home. The Red Sox fell to 11-15 at home this season, the third-worst mark in the American League and by far the worst in the division. The Red Sox are 50-57 at home going back to the start of last season. If you can’t win at home, you almost certainly won’t win a playoff spot. The mere fact that we are talking about the possibility of a wild-card spot is a testament to how this team has exceeded expectations early in the season. Experts had them headed for the basement in the AL East. While they are closer to last place than first, they have kept their heads above water and are ahead of the Rays and the Blue Jays. The Red Sox have been far from perfect. They have given up a staggering 37 unearned runs this season, a reminder their defense is fragile at best. The offense has been inconsistent, especially with runners on. They have run into outs. All of that speaks to a collection of young players. So does the excitement they flash at times. It’s been a fun, if occasionally frustrating, team to watch. “I know what we are as a team,” Cora told reporters after Sunday’s game. “There are things we have to do better but I bet there’s a lot of people a little surprised at what we’re doing. But if we continue to do those things, we’re going to be in the mix.” That’s more than anyone expected this season. Even if staying in the mix has come with mixed results along the way.

        "content": "Powerline tampering has been on the rise over the last 10 days. Photo: File image Senior Sergeant Roy Appley said reports of powerline tampering and copper and electrical supply thefts have increased over the past 10 days. \"Incidents are occurring across Christchurch, including multiple central locations such as Disraeli St in Addington, the area surrounding Hillview Rd and Phillips Rd in Phillipstown and Brougham St, they are as wide spanning as West Melton, Halswell, and Marshlands. \"Police have informed community patrol and frontline police units on what to look out for and have communicated with businesses and residents in affected areas.\" Officers are also talking to scrap metal dealers as part of the investigation, Appley said. \"On multiple recent occasions powerline tampering and the theft of copper from the powerlines have led to power outages on affected streets. \"Typically once the offenders get what they want, the powerlines are left in an exposed and dangerous state. \"In one occasion powerlines were tampered with and left broken outside of a Phillip St pre-school. \"Fortunately, no one has been harmed, but as far as police are concerned it is only a matter of time.\" In February, three men were charged over powerline tampering and electrical thefts in the Bromley area. “Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone, including yourself, gets hurt. “You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return. \"We are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in identifying and locating those involved. “If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it. “We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires – do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away,” said Appley. Residents should call 111 if they see anyone acting suspiciously around power poles and lines or phone 105 after the fact.",

        "description": "Party leader Chhagan Bhujbal says NCP should get a larger share of seats in the Assembly election than it had received in LS polls; Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis replies that BJP’s Mahayuti allies would be accorded due respect in seat-sharing process",
        "content": "Scarcely has the dust of the Lok Sabha election settled than the ruling Ajit Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is girding up for the Maharashtra Assembly polls to be held later this year. The tone and tenor of the crucial meeting of the State executive of Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction in Mumbai on Monday saw Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, along with other senior leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal and Sunil Tatkare already making noises about getting a larger share of seats from its partners in the Mahayuti government — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena — in the Assembly election likely to be held in October this year. “Elections are a test for party workers. No one should be over-the-top with joy following an election victory, nor should one be disheartened by defeat,” said Mr. Pawar while addressing his party workers at the meet. Minister Chhagan Bhujbal made it clear that the NCP would have to be given a larger share of seats in the Assembly election than it had received in the general election this year. 80-90 constituencies: Bhujbal “Only if we are given 80-90 seats [of the total 288 Assembly seats in Maharashtra] can we hope to win 50 or 60 of them. Whatever may have happened this time [Lok Sabha seat-sharing process], but in the coming election, the NCP should get its rightful share of seats. When we entered [the Mahayuti coalition], we were told we would be given our fair share of seats,” Mr. Bhujbal said. Mr. Pawar also staked claim to the Satara Rajya Sabha seat during the course of his address. Mr. Pawar, who split the NCP founded by his uncle Sharad Pawar in July last year, had been given only four Lok Sabha seats — Baramati, Shirur, Raigad, Dharashiv — of the total 48 in the Mahayuti’s seat-sharing formula. The BJP, being the largest party in the State in terms of number of MPs, had fielded candidates on 29 Lok Sabha seats. However, Mr. Shinde had driven a hard bargain with his saffron ally, managing to secure 15 Lok Sabha seats in the Shiv Sena’s kitty. This had upset Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction, which had been importuning the BJP high command for at least eight Lok Sabha seats. ‘BJP will contest most seats’ Meanwhile, responding to Mr. Bhujbal’s remarks, BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP would get the maximum seats to contest the Assembly election as it was numerically the biggest party. At the same time, Mr. Fadnavis assured that the BJP’s Mahayuti allies would be accorded due respect in the seat-sharing process. “Leaders of all the three parties of the Mahayuti alliance will sit together to decide a proper seat-sharing formula for the Assembly election. Obviously, BJP will get the maximum number of seats as it is the biggest party. However, our allies will be shown due respect in the process,” he said. In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election, the BJP had won 105 seats, while its then ally — the undivided Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray had won 56 seats. The undivided Nationalist Congress Party, which was part of the opposition Congress-led UPA, had won 41 seats.

        "content": "Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Monday (AEST). In Touch Weekly provided the first details of the scary scene, labelling it an “apparent medical scare”. “Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded,” a source told the outlet. “Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone’s screens. The publication did not know whether Tyson, 57, was removed from the flight, which had been delayed two hours in Miami. The reported medical scare delayed passengers leaving the plane for 25 minutes. “He was in first class, but we were in an exit row and the stewardess was very chatty. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter,” a source told In Touch Weekly. “She said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK’. I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” Tyson, who turns 58 next month, is scheduled to fight Jake Paul on July 20 in Dallas in his return to the ring. The former heavyweight champion last fought a sanctioned fight in June 2005, although he battled Roy Jones Jr. to a draw in a November 2020 exhibition. It’s led to concerns about whether he should be stepping in the ring against Paul, but his representatives insisted Tyson is “doing great” in an email to the New York Post. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,” the email read. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Mike Tyson has suffered a scary medical issue before his upcoming fight against Jake Paul. Picture: Sarah Stier/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Tyson said earlier this month that he’s going to defeat Paul in what has been officially sanctioned by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations as a heavyweight bout. His training regiment has included him giving up sex and marijuana. “He couldn’t even knock out [Nate] Diaz,” Tyson said of Paul. “Diaz is 40 pounds. He’s going to knock me out? Anderson Silva. He couldn’t even knock out the little guys, how’s he going to knock me out? . He never knocked out a real man, come on. He didn’t knock out Tommy Fury. I’m going to f–k Jake up.” Paul, as to be expected, believes he’ll end Tyson’s career with a loss. “But what I promise to the people on July 20th: Mike will be put to sleep and he will feel my power,” Paul said. “I will go down as the man who put Tyson to sleep for the last time.” This article was originally published by the New York Post and reproduced with permission",

'Mathew also kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin & Stacey. 'All his Gavin & Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page. 'They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.'

'The fact that the documentary will be made by Fulwell 73, which is co-owned by James and is a co-producer of the sitcom, means they’ll enjoy full access on set and get all the biggest chats.

        "content": "Britain's Got Talent fans spotted a big problem with the show's first live semi-final tonight. A total of eight acts performed including Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust, with singer Innocent Massuki closing the show with an impressive performance. However, fans were left puzzled by the decision to have so many Golden Buzzer acts in the first show. Normally, each judge - Bruno Tonioli , Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, and Alesha Dixon, plus hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly get one Golden Buzzer each. However, they broke the rules and several judges gave out more than one. As the first semi-final aired tonight, fans were puzzled to see so many Golden Buzzer acts in the first show. Ssaulabi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Duo Stardust were all Golden Buzzer acts, and they all performed tonight. Taryn got a Golden Buzzer during the auditions ( Image: Dymond/Thames/REX/Shutterstock) One wrote: \"Are they doing all the golden buzzers tonight? Seems odd #BGT #BritainsGotTalent ,\" whilst a second added: \"What's with so many golden buzzer acts tonight? #BritainsGotTalent .\" A third shared: \"May aswell rename it the Golden Buzzer show at this rate, featuring a man in a bag #britainsgottalent ,\" with a fourth adding: \"Most of the golden buzzers are on tonight I noticed.\" \"Haven't watched the auditions. How many golden buzzers are there?! Last time I watched they had one each and out one in each semi-final?! #BritainsGotTalent ,\" a fifth penned, as a sixth added: \"Every act tonight is a golden buzzer act?? This show is silly #BritainsGotTalent .\" A seventh wrote: \"Why are they putting all the golden buzzer acts on tonight? There's only meant to be 4 and I'm sure I've seen 3 already #bgt britainsgottalent .\" This year, there was nine Golden Buzzers in total. Speaking about his decision to allow it, Simon shared: \"Well, the truth is, honestly, when I watched the yes tapes back, I thought there were about another 17 acts who easily could have had a golden buzzer. That’s how good the talent is this year. But look, I think eight or nine is the absolute limit. I don't think you could ever really go beyond nine, well, maybe 10 at a push! But I always listen to the audience and the feedback I got was they enjoyed seeing more golden buzzers.\" * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "An American quarry company on Monday rejected the Mexican president’s campaign of criticisms and closures, as well as his offer to buy its property on the Caribbean coast. In July, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered to buy the American company’s Caribbean coast property for about $385 million amid a bitter, years-long dispute. Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion. The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say the project has damaged the caves, which hold some of the oldest human remains in North America. The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico. The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train.",

        "description": "The 26-year-old has struggled for Manchester United this season and was left out of England’s training squad for Euro 2024.",
        "content": "Marcus Rashford is planning to take some time to reset mentally after acknowledging he has endured a “challenging season”. The England forward was left out of Gareth Southgate’s training squad for Euro 2024 after scoring just eight goals in all competitions for a struggling Manchester United side who finished eighth in the Premier League. But after helping his club end the season on a high by beating Manchester City in Saturday’s FA Cup final, the 26-year-old will now look to make the most of his summer of rest. And as he announced his decision to step away from his social media accounts for a few weeks, Rashford – who last month said “enough is enough” after receiving online abuse – responded again to his critics. He wrote on X: “It’s time to come off socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. “Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t, just remember at United, we always stick together.” Team-mate Luke Shaw did make Southgate’s provisional squad despite injuries restricting him to only 15 appearances for United this season, the last of them in February. The full-back has addressed criticism over his apparent availability for his country, but not his club. Shaw posted on Instagram: “I don’t normally react to things I see on social media, but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. “The reality is I am not 100 per cent fit for either right now, but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. “I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.” Meanwhile, team-mate Anthony Martial bade an emotional farewell to the club after confirming his nine-year stay at Old Trafford was over. The 28-year-old France international joined the Red Devils in a £36million move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on Instagram, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "description": "Indigenous culture took centre stage in Super Netball First Nations Round, but what are the clubs doing in National Reconciliation Week to form an authentic connection with community? Meanwhile, the Fever have finally been dethroned after a six-week winning streak.",
        "content": "Wow, that went fast! Week seven marked the midway point of the Super Netball season and the first half of First Nations Round. The action began on Kabi Kabi Country, where the Sunshine Coast Lightning made it two wins in a row to claim Queensland Derby bragging rights against the Firebirds, 76-65. A grand final re-match between the Adelaide Thunderbirds and NSW Swifts on Kaurna Country saw the visiting team succumb to the lowest-ever Super Netball score in history, 58-33. Yes, you read that right. The Melbourne Mavericks' drought at home continued as they lost 66-59 to the Giants in Naarm. Before the Melbourne Vixens became the first team this season to beat the West Coast Fever in stunning fashion in Boorloo, 76-65. If you missed it, don't worry — we'll get you up to speed with our Super Netball Round-Up. First Nations Round, part one One of the key differences in fixtures this season has been the split of First Nations Round. Previously, the league held its celebration of Indigenous culture across back-to-back rounds during National Reconciliation Week (May 27- June 3) to allow each club a chance to host. But this year, Super Netball has a larger gap between the two rounds so that the first was held right before National Reconciliation Week in round seven and the second aligns with the start of NAIDOC Week (July 7 – July 14) in round 13. The shift on the Super Netball calendar was recommended by First Nations engagement lead and Kamilaroi woman Ali Tucker-Munro, who was appointed in her role in July 2023. The sport has made important steps in this space since its – such as its recent introduction of an named the Black Swans. Netball takes a significant step in its commitment to increase the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander athletes, introducing an inaugural First Nations team to compete against World Cup talent at the Pacific Aus Sport Netball Series. \"The reason for separating the rounds and playing in the lead-up to National Reconciliation Week was because it sets the tone,\" Tucker-Munro said. \"The week is all about reflection and for non-Indigenous Australians to recognise what they need to do to be part of the reconciliation journey. \"The intent was to give all of netball's member organisations and Super Netball teams the opportunity to demonstrate what they're doing in partnership with our communities, because that's the missing piece. \"Instead of sitting there and either thinking or saying, 'Our sport needs to do better,' people need to recognise that they have to be part of that change as much as anyone else. \"So, what does reconciliation mean to you as a non-Indigenous Australian and what are you doing in the other 50 weeks of the year to make a change at your team, club or association level? \"That's what's important to our community, because we as First Nations people can sense if something is inauthentic from a mile away.\" Most grassroots associations will be hosting activities this upcoming Saturday and Sunday during the actual week, and Tucker-Munro reiterates it was Super Netball's job to amplify its \"Join in the Journey\" message ahead of time to set an example for the entire ecosystem. The fact remains that just two of Super Netball's 80 full-time athletes are Indigenous – a ratio much lower than what we see in the footballing codes. So, the purpose of the round should be to build a genuine relationship with the Indigenous community, celebrate their contribution to the sport and find ways to retain First Nations talent in netball. ABC Sport has been in touch with each of the Super Netball clubs to find out more about the kinds of activities each team got up to this week. The dresses this year were stunning of course, but it can be easy to get caught up in what's happening at that superficial level and harder to find out about the action behind the scenes. It would be great to see clubs promote their work in this space more prominently on social media. The host broadcaster Fox Netball can also play a role in highlighting this. Last year's Indigenous round turned into a PR disaster for Super Netball, but rising star Gabby Coffey hopes a renewed focus this year will help draw Indigenous athletes to the sport. For instance, Super Netball stars Leesa Mi Mi (Wakka Wakka) and Donnell Wallam (Noongar) were talked about on the coverage, but Vixens training partner Gabby Coffey (Wiradjuri) less so, even after she was elevated to the team's game-day squad through injury. To focus on the positives, two great examples of connection that caught our eye included Lightning's and Netball Queensland taking the next step in their Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Lightning's video was filmed on Kabi Kabi Country with elders from local First Nations Group Yir'un-Yalangi and has been played at every one of the club's home games this season. Meanwhile, Netball Queensland moved on to the second part of its RAP process \"Innovate\" last week and for a second straight year, the Firebirds First Nations dresses will be auctioned off to raise money for their Diamond Spirit program. Fever's winning streak finally broken It may have taken seven rounds to find a side that could dismantle Fever's attacking dominance, but from an entertainment perspective, it was worth the wait. The Vixens, sitting second in the league, had their five-game unbeaten streak snapped last week in round six against the Lightning. Yet they bounced back from that loss to put on their best performance so far in 2024 – despite missing a couple of players. Defender Kate Eddy was out for a second straight week with a leg injury, while midcourter Zara Walters was missing for a fourth round in a row as she continues to rehab a lower back issue. These omissions didn't stop the Vixens from running rampant at the back of the court and head coach Simone McKinnis didn't even make a single change to her starting seven. Experienced defenders Emily Mannix and Jo Weston got their usual starts, this time at goal defence and wing defence, allowing Rudi Ellis to occupy the goal keeper bib. Ellis played two seasons at the Fever before heading back to Vixens this year and her insights into the workings of her former club truly came in handy. Playing against the tallest shooter in the competition, Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard, Ellis used her footwork and timing to overcome the 8-centimetre difference in the match-up. There's a reason Fowler-Nembhard is a five-time Super Netball MVP and her team's ball speed and incredible work rate have made it difficult to stop the feed heading into her in their shooting circle. Enter Mannix, Weston and Ellis at the peak of their powers and suddenly Fever were the most unsteady we've seen them this season, panicking and trying to force the ball long. That pressure crept into Fowler-Nembhard's game too, as she had her first miss midway through the first quarter and went on to finish the game with 43/47 at 92 per cent accuracy. It seems crazy to suggest a player had an off game while shooting in the 90 percentile, and that's a compliment to Fowler-Nembhard's standards – because she is just so tough to face. But when we see her typically tallying 60-plus goals each week and only ever missing one or two goals in a match, it shows how much of a thorn Ellis was in her side for round seven. So huge kudos to Ellis (four gains, one rebound, one deflection, three intercepts) is in order, as well to her teammates Mannix, Weston and Kate Moloney at centre for their work out front. It's no surprise that the team is excelling under the guidance of Vixens' specialist defence coach and two-time world champion Sharni Norder (née Layton), who was rightly tight-lipped and unwilling to share much about their game plan. Crowds are on the up We've already alluded to this this season, but it has been great to see a boom in crowd numbers. Fans turn up in droves to break Super Netball's opening round attendance records. At the halfway point, there has been a 34 per cent increase in the average attendance per round (now up to 21,613) in comparison with crowd numbers at this point last year. This is partly due to the move for Super Netball teams to play at larger venues – such as the Thunderbirds for their home games, thanks to a leg-up offered by their state government to underwrite the costs. In round seven, 8,447 people turned up to watch their side take on the Swifts, marking the biggest turnout they've had so far this season. Other state governments should take notice. For instance, the Lightning had a sell-out crowd on Saturday for the Queensland Derby, but the USC stadium capacity only holds 3,000 people. Imagine how many fans would have come through the gates for the Battle of the Bruce Highway if they had played at a larger venue. However, the club that has truly been leading the way ever since the Super Netball era began is the Fever. On Sunday, 11,119 fans turned up to Perth Arena to watch a top-of-the-ladder contest against the Vixens. Their side may have lost the game, but it was a huge win for the club off the court, as that was Fever's biggest crowd ever for a non-finals match. In fact, they've registered four of their top five regular season crowds over the past two years. At a time when the sport is trying to realise its true commercial potential, whatever Fever is getting up to on the west coast should be studied because it is seriously impressive. 11,119 Fever v Vixens Round 7 2024 11,013 Fever v Giants Round 13 2023 10,764 Fever v Lightning Round 12 2023 8,702 Fever v Lightning Round 2 2024 8,306 Fever v Giants Round 6 2018 Is Ash Ervin our next gen Diamonds GK? Australia has a long history of producing impressive goal keepers. Liz Ellis, Laura Geitz and the incumbent Courtney Bruce are just some of the names on the long list of Diamonds defenders who are considered legends of the world game. Watching 21-year-old Ash Ervin play for the Sunshine Coast Lightning this year has therefore got a lot of fans excited about the future of our national team. Defenders typically bloom in the later stages of their careers, as it takes them a bit longer to mature into that role. It takes many years to develop the nuance required to read the game and how best to assert yourself in the contest as the last line of defence. But Ervin – with her height (192cm), wingspan, courage and timing – is playing beyond her years. In round seven, Ervin was recognised as the player of the match against the Firebirds, for her 11 gains including four intercepts, nine deflections and four rebounds. She was only penalised seven times. Overall, Ervin sits second in the league for deflections (47) and fourth for intercepts (13), putting her well and truly in contention for Super Netball's Rising Star award. Without trying to heap too much pressure on the young goal keeper's shoulders, it appears as if this young woman is going to be very important to Australia moving forward and that talent needs to be nurtured by the national high-performance system as much as possible. Ervin has already got a bit of a taste for the international stage too, playing Fast 5 for the green and gold in netball's modified version of the game last year. Speaking after the win against the Firebirds, Ervin credited her work alongside Bruce this season – after the Diamonds GK moved to the Sunshine Coast this year and was seen giving her tips at half-time – as one of the catalysts for her form. \"She's had such a big impact on my game, it's amazing how she shares her intelligence, I'm really grateful for her insight,\" Ervin told Fox Netball. Next weekend Ervin faces the best shooter in the world in Fowler-Nembhard. Watch this space.",

But it tells only part of the tale of a compelling spectacle lasting 3hr 5min hours that featured stunning strokes from both men and swings of momentum fit for a thriller. It continued after a final forehand from Nadal sailed long, inside of honing into the court like it did when he was at his peak, with the Spaniard agreeing to address his subjects from the court. He had knocked back a farewell ceremony as he is not certain this is the end. It is a message he reiterated again, because his mind remains willing and the body that had broken down badly over the past couple of years is now starting to feel better again. As a case in point, against most other rivals competing at Roland Garros, he probably would have prevailed, so high was his standard. As he said when reflecting at a press conference later; “I was not far away.” “It is difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it is going to be the last time I am here in front of you. I am not 100 percent sure. But if it is the last time, I enjoyed it,” he said. “The feelings that I have had today are difficult to describe in words but it is so special to feel the love that I have received in the place that I have loved. “I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be back at Roland Garros. I was competitive. I had my changes. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” TOPSHOT - Germany's Alexander Zverev plays a backhand return to Spain's Rafael Nadal during their men's singles match on Court Philippe-Chatrier on day two of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros Complex in Paris on May 27, 2024.

That has long seemed a likely end date, provided his body remained fit enough, but he continues to improve, he remains a threat. As a result, it is exceptionally unlikely he will feature at Wimbledon, with the switch between clay and grass and then back to clay likely to prove problematic. “It is difficult to say what is going on in the future. I am travelling with the family and I am having fun. And the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago,” he said. “Maybe in two months I say, ‘It is enough’. But it is something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front of me. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared. “The amount of feelings I have had on this amazing court during my tennis career have been unbelievable. I could not imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 - I wish I was 28. It has been a beautiful process. “What makes me feel so special is all the people who are at Roland Garros behind the scenes who have been helping me from my first visit here. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again. But I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” PARIS, FRANCE - MAY 27: Rafael Nadal of Spain looks on from his seat after his defeat by Alexander Zverev of Germany in the Men's Singles first round match on Day Two of the 2024 French Open at Roland Garros on May 27, 2024 in Paris, France. (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images The atmosphere during the three hour match was akin to a Davis Cup final but there was no split in support from the crowd. Everyone was willing the 14-time champion to add another famous memory to a catalogue grander than any to have played at the venue. “Rafa. Rafa. Rafa!” At times the chant became a deafening roar that reverberated around Philippe Chatrier Court, the volume enhanced by the roof in place due to torrential rain at times that interrupted play on the outside courts. It was the hottest ticket in Paris and a spectacle even the players, who rarely stray from their routine of bouncing between their hotel, the courts and the massage table during tournaments, could not miss. Novak Djokovic, who has a 30-29 advantage of over his great rival, camped not far behind the Zverev box to take in what proved to be an exceptional second set of tennis. Iga Swiatek, who began her campaign for a third straight Roland Garros title in swift fashion a match earlier, was back courtside to watch her idol in action. Carlos Alcaraz, too, watched with concern on his face as Nadal tried valiantly to level the match deep in the second set. French stars including Alize Cornet also dropped in to watch. Roger Federer’s agent Tony Godsick was on hand as well and entered the Nadal camp prior to the match to offer his well wishes. “I am happy that happens because that means I had a positive legacy here and a positive moment in my career,” Nadal said. Near the entrance to the grounds fans who had braved the wintry conditions stopped to consider and also photograph the 3m steel sculpture of the Spaniard scorching a forehand. The statue is now three years old and an honour to a living legend. So rare has Nadal’s reign been, he earned a tribute to his domination while he was still winning major titles. Are those days behind him? Clearly his domination is. But Nadal showed enough to suggest that if he is fit, there might yet be another marvellous moment to savour, perhaps with a golden tinge back at Roland Garros in a couple of months time. Nadal started slowly, making a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes in the opening game, including a double fault, to concede serve. But from early in the second set he began striking the backhand with more venom while getting a toehold in Zverev’s service games. PARIS, FRANCE - MAY 27: Rafael Nadal of Spain plays a forehand during his match against against Alexander Zverev of Germany in the Men's Singles first round match on Day Two of the 2024 French Open at Roland Garros on May 27, 2024 in Paris, France. (Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images If the 22-time major winner was shaky on serve early in the match, he did little to concede when broken back deep in the second. The German, simply, was too good, playing inspired tennis from 3-5, 15-30 to surge back into the set. But there were moments where Nadal rolled back the clock. The thunderous forehand he thumped at full sprint that went whizzing by an advancing Zverev in the second set tiebreaker was one. So, too, another that enabled him to break serve to start the third set. He was in unfamiliar territory by that stage, trailing by two sets at Roland Garros for just the second time. Later in the set he somehow returned a smash from Zverev with a forehand carrying even more venom that left the German shaking his head. His touch at the net, too, was sublime. Every time the legend had a volley in the first two sets, he won the point, with the angles he found time and again simply exquisite. But the rustiness was apparent and pitted against a rival he described as “one of the best in the world”, it was a combination that caused his downfall. A drop shot on the backhand side was one example. But more to the point, he could not hit through his rival enough either. Zverev is younger and stronger. He found greater angles on his serve and was able to hit winners with greater frequency. Nadal was almost unbeatable in Paris, with his record now standing at 128-4. But Father Time is unbeatable. Even those who once seemed immortal eventually surrender. “I played I think at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So (I’m) happy for that,” he said. “Of course (I’m) disappointed for losing, but in terms of (my) body feeling, (I’m) happy that I finish healthy ... and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more. So that’s it. Accept the moment. If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself. “I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” Nadal's wife Xisca Perello and their son leaves the court after Spain's Rafael Nadal lost against Germany's Alexander Zverev in their men's singles match on Court Philippe-Chatrier on day two of The French Open tennis tournament at The Roland Garros Complex in Paris on May 27, 2024.

He noted that the SJB has therefore proposed dates for debates involving both the Economic Councils and Leadership to the NPP. However, he expressed disappointment that the NPP has yet to respond to the request for the Economic Council debate. “However, the NPP’s response did not address the Economic Council. They assert that they have not yet formulated an economic policy. If they aspire to govern effectively, it is imperative for them to develop a comprehensive economic policy,” he said. Marikkar noted that while the NPP aims to prioritise the leadership debate, the SJB is open to this arrangement but under the condition that dates for the economic council debate are also provided. “We are not prepared to attend a mere political discussion,” he said",

        "description": "One of Australia's biggest mango growers, Manbulloo Limited, has planted its largest ever patch of new varieties in the Northern Territory.",
        "content": "One of Australia's biggest mango growers is ramping up the commercial rollout of three long-awaited mango varieties. Manbulloo Limited has just planted about 4,000 of the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties at its Ballongilly farm near Katherine, 300 kilometres south-east of Darwin. The three varieties are the result of 25 years of development from the National Mango Breeding Program and in 2022, Manbulloo was awarded their commercial rights. In Queensland a total of 20,000 trees of the new varieties were planted among 26 growers including Manbulloo. Another 26 farmers across Australia will also plant the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties, under Manbulloo's commercial rollout. New mangoes planted Manbulloo managing director Marie Piccone said most of the new varieties were being planted in Queensland. It has taken decades of work and a number of setbacks, but three mango varieties are being commercially rolled out — and finally have names. \"We're hoping for some more expansion in New South Wales, West Australia and Northern Territory,\" she said. \"We have indications now, based on trees that have been planted in the last 12 months and trees that are on order, being produced in nurseries right now, that the volume will continue to increase. \"We'll put a cap on that once we've got enough volume to supply profitable customers.\" Ms Piccone said Manbulloo would focus on selling the new mangoes to the domestic market, but had an eye on exports in the future. \"There's potential in every market in the world because these varieties taste very good and are flavoursome,\" she said. \"But in terms of which markets we will hone in on, that will be dependent on profitability and potential in the domestic market.\" Planting at Ballongilly The 4,000 new mangoes planted at Ballongilly took six people just five days to put in the ground. Farm manager Trevor Nelson said one of the big challenges was keeping wallabies away from the young trees. \"We've put up a big fence around them to try and prevent any wallabies from getting in,\" Mr Nelson said. \"So far it's working. Obviously wallabies can jump over but we have a big skirt on there and all we can do is try our best.\" Most of the new mangoes planted at Ballongilly were the Yess! variety. \"They were selected because they have great flavour, consistent flowering and quite a heavy yield,\" Ms Piccone said. \"In terms of the Northern Territory, the Yess! [fruits] earlier than the other places.\"",

        "content": "Manchester City winger Jack Grealish nearly suffered a catastrophic accident during the Premier League celebrations on Sunday. Grealish nearly took a tumble off the open-top bus not once, but twice during their victory parade around Manchester. This celebration marked their fourth consecutive title win, a feat no team has achieved in England before. The 28-year-old was clearly enjoying the festivities and the bubbly, just a day after City's 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup final by arch-rivals Manchester United . However, the England international had two close calls; the first was when he was dancing on the seats at the back of the bus, mistakenly thinking it was stationary. READ MORE: Two City players could face uncertain summers READ MORE: Seven forgotten City players who could raise millions He received quite the surprise when the driver accelerated, prompting team-mate Jeremy Doku to grab Grealish's legs and help him down. The second incident occurred later on as Grealish , donning a cap, stood in the same spot alongside teammates Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake . Both players had to grab Grealish when the bus started moving again to stop him from falling. Despite the rain and Saturday's loss, the players' spirits remained high as they celebrated City's unique achievement. Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias stopped Jack Grealish from falling (Image: X/bluemoon_mcfc) Grealish, who didn't play against United, even commandeered a TV camera at one point, holding it while he danced. Fans thronged the streets as City made their way from Cathedral Gardens, passing by the National Football Museum, through Exchange Square and down Deansgate, ending the parade outside the Hilton hotel. Some supporters were so keen to engage with the players that they scaled scaffolding. Manager Pep Guardiola was seen enjoying a cigar as he celebrated with his team, hours before news broke that the ex-Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss could depart City next summer when his contract ends. \"We are happy, it's a big achievement, that's why we are here again,\" Guardiola shared with fans. \"Even myself I couldn't expect to stay here eight years but everything goes well. \"Step by step we are here and it looks like a routine [having a bus parade at the end of a season] but it's not a routine.\" He then pledged: \"We will be back next season. The FA Cup, we will take it.\" He got hold of the TV camera at one point (Image: X/@obviouslyruben4) Phil Foden, City's player of the year, added: \"It's been a special season. Nobody has done it before. \"It's an unbelievable season. It's the hunger inside me. We've got great players, we want to win more next season.\" Top scorer Erling Haaland also expressed: \"It's been lovely, this club is amazing, I'm so proud of everyone. \"There have been many good moments. When we knew we were gonna win the league, that was the best one. \"The support we get home and away is unbelievable.\" City will have the opportunity to claim their next piece of silverware on August 10 when they face United in the Community Shield.

        "content": "According to him, he would definitely like to come back in the future because Barcelona is the club of his life and he has enjoyed every bit of the experience in recent years. Xavi added that even if the past few weeks have been really tough for him, his conscience is very clear. His words, “Yes, I would like a return, why not? Barcelona is the club of my life. I have enjoyed this experience — and also suffered, of course. But I love being at this club and working for it. I am fine. It’s been tough last week, but I have my conscience very clear. I’m proud and happy. When we got here we knew it was a difficult time for the club and I think we can be proud of the work we have done.” WOW. Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça, is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as “The Classic” (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.

        "content": "Ms McLoughlin’s niece, Rebecca Leydon was also struck by the train and received a broken leg. The late Jessica McLoughlin. The scene of the accident near Ballisodare last summer. Coroner Eamon MacGowan returned a narrative verdict at the inquest into the death of Sligo woman Jessica McLoughlin (40) who was killed after being hit by a train at Knoxpark, Co Sligo last summer. After hearing the evidence at the inquest on Monday at Sligo Courthouse, the coroner said he was bringing in a narrative verdict that Ms McLoughlin of Rusheen Ard, Sligo, died on June 14 2023 on the rail line at Knoxpark from injuries sustained from colliding with the train on the background of her having alcohol and drug intoxication. Ms McLoughlin’s niece, Rebecca Leydon was also struck by the train and received a broken leg. Her deposition was read out by Sgt Derek Butler. She said she remembered the day of the train crash. Both her and her aunt went to the train station in Sligo. Her mother left them to the train station and they were going to get the train to Dublin for a day out. She said she thought it was one o’clock. They had a few drinks. They got off the train in Collooney because she left her phone in the shop in Sligo. She said she felt guilty about this. They were walking back to Sligo on the train line. She said they didn’t realise there was a train due from Sligo. They heard the train horn and she said when she looked she didn’t think it was going to hit them but the steps hit them. The scene of the accident near Ballisodare last summer. Ms Leydon said she did not remember much else after that. She broke her leg and got staples in two spots. “I miss my auntie Jessica. She helped me a lot. When I was homeless, she gave me her bed,” Ms Leydon’s deposition concluded. The second witness was the driver of the train, Padraig O’Gara. He said that on Wednesday, June 14, 2023 he was the driver of the 3:05pm Sligo to Dublin train. After the train passed over the Ballisodare water bridge, it was going around a long sweeping bend to the left. He saw two women in the distance in the middle of the track walking towards him. He immediately blew the horn and applied the train brakes to the emergency position. The two ladies moved to the side of the track. One lady jumped clear. The other lady didn’t. She stood on the outside of the rail track while still standing on the track. She was crouched forward. Mr O’Gara continued to blow the train horn as he knew she wasn’t clear. She collided with the side of the train. As the train was coming to a halt, he rang the Controller Signal man in Dublin Connolly Station. He informed them of the situation and requested an ambulance, fire brigade and gardaí to attend the scene. He informed them of his exact location and on the nearest access points for the emergency services to access the scene. His colleague, Ticket Inspector Greg Flanagan, contacted him from the rear of the cab of the train and he told him what happened. Mr Flanagan got off the train and went back to where the ladies were. Mr O’Gara said he heard the ambulance coming and he went back to the access point to guide them back to the scene. He assisted them with their equipment and brought them to where his colleague and the two ladies were. The Coroner asked Mr O’Gara about when he saw the two women if he hit the emergency brake and he replied he did and blew the horn. He said the train was travelling at 60 miles per hour. The Coroner told him he did all that he could do to stop his train and he couldn’t move left or right. Mr McGowan said it was an unfortunate thing to happen and he hopes he mends and does not carry it into the future and the train driver thanked him. The next witness was Greg Flanagan. He said he was working on the 3:05 train from Sligo to Dublin. They left Sligo and just after Ballisodare suddenly the emergency brakes came on and the horn sounded. He was in the back cab and there were 100 passengers on board. Padraig O’Gara the train driver and himself were the only two Irish Rail staff on board. The train them came to a complete stop and he contacted Padraig on the intercom and asked him if he was alright. Mr Flanagan said he knew what was after happening as he looked out the window and saw a woman about 100 metres back lying on the side of the line. He told Padraig that if he wanted to stay where he was and contact the emergency services that he would go back to the woman. Padraig stayed where he was and when Mr Flanagan went down, he seen there were two women. One woman was crying and trying to stand up. The other woman was moaning lying on the ground and he could see she had serious injuries to her stomach. He told the women not to be moving and that the emergency services were coming. He went back to the train and got a drink of water for the women and he told Padraig the two women were injured and one was very serious. He went back to the women and the girl with the bad leg drank the bottle of water. The Fire Service came then and he went back to the train to make the passengers comfortable. A deposition from Paramedic Kieran Currid was read out by Sergeant Gráinne Fagan to the inquest. He said they received a call about persons hit by a train. They brought the ambulance as far as they could at the scene in Ballisodare. They went on foot down the railway line to the injured parties. One patient was speaking so they knew she was alive. Along with his colleague Michael McGonigle, they treated the other female. The patient was unresponsive with a major open wound to her lower left side. Initially she had a pulse and they treated the wound. Then the patient went into cardiac arrest. They started CPR and a doctor attended the scene. The doctor pronounced Ms McLoughlin deceased at the scene. Sgt Fagan read out her deposition. She said she was on duty at 3:45pm at Collooney Garda Station and she was informed of an incident on the rail line between Ballisodare and Collooney that two females had sustained injuries. She travelled to the scene and accessed through Parkes’ Garage and had a brief conversation with the train driver, Padraig O’Gara who said the train had collided with two females walking on the line. He said he had applied the emergency brakes and sounded the horn but the females didn’t clear the line in time to avoid contact. The train had four carriages stationary on the track. She was informed there were 100 passengers on board and they had been instructed by Iarnrod Éireann not to disembark. Sgt Fagan continued further down the line and met Dt Gda Sandra Deery, Gda David Hannon and Gda Tom Dooner who were on the scene upon her arrival. The Ambulance service, Fire Service and representatives of Iarnrod Éireann were there. The two females were being treated by the emergency response personnel. Dt Gda Deery identified Jessica McLoughlin to her as she was known to her. Dr Seán Underwood pronounced her deceased at the scene at 4:28pm. Rebecca McLoughlin was stretchered onto a rail trolley platform and brought to Sligo University Hospital. The passengers were escorted from the train and brought to waiting buses at 5:30pm. Sgt Fagan boarded the train and viewed CCTV footage at the time of impact. She observed Rebecca Leydon and Jessica McLoughlin step off the track. Jessica McLoughlin then leant forward but remained in the path of the train and was ultimately struck. She remained at the scene until 8:50pm when the body of Jessica McLoughlin was removed and escorted to Sligo University Hospital by Gda Seamus McGowan. Garda Brian Fowley and Garda Derek Healy both Scene of crime Examiners finished examination of the scene at 10:36pm. Gda Fowley gave her two bags of exhibits. On Saturday, June 17 and Friday, June 22, Sgt Fagan called to Rebecca Leydon at Sligo University Hospital to check on her progress and return personal items to her including €150 cash, her passport and a bag with make up and personal items. Sgt Fagan told the inquest she wanted to take the opportunity to convey her sincere condolences to Jessica’s family. Dt Gda Sandra Deery of Carrick-on-Shannon Garda Station read out her deposition to the inquest. She said on Wednesday June 14 at 3:30pm she heard a request from control seeking any available units to assist at a report of two females having been hit by a train near Parkes’ Garage in Ballisodare. She indicated to control she was available and dispatched to the scene and arrived at the scene at Knoxpark at 4:05pm. She made her way onto the train tracks to the scene of the incident. The first person she met was Padraig O’Gara. He said that he blew the horn but the girl didn’t clear the track. She enquired as to his welfare and he said he was ok. She spoke to Mary Connolly who identified herself as the Station Manager in Sligo train station. Incident Officer Paddy Donnelly was on route. Paramedics were working on the two casualties. At approximately 4:30pm Rebecca Leydon was moved from the scene. Paramedics had stopped working on the other casualty, she was Jessica McLoughlin and she was known to her. Dt Gda Deery informed Sgt Fagan and Sgt McGrath of the identity of the deceased. She preserved the scene and kept a log. Garda Seamus McGowan of Coolaney Garda Station told the inquest he was on duty from 4pm and was made aware of an incident that had taken place on the railway line between Ballisodare and Collooney where two people had been injured. He arrived at the scene at 4:40pm. He entered the railway line from the Ballisodare side where he met Dt Gda Sandra Deery where he was informed that the female that was fatally injured was Jessica McLoughlin who was known to him. He took up preservation of the scene and escorted the body of Jessica McLoughlin to the mortuary at Sligo University Hospital at 8:50pm. At 9:31pm, the body of Jessica McLoughlin was formally identified to him by her brother, Jason McLoughlin. Depositions were also read at the inquest by Sgt Butler from Mary Connolly, Station Manager, Sligo Train Station, Dr Seán Underwood who was working at the Emergency Department of Sligo University Hospital and attended the scene and who pronounced Ms McLoughlin deceased at 4:28pm and also treated Ms Leydon and accompanied her in the ambulance to Sligo University Hospital.

He took photographs of the scene and he then took photographs of the train and the front left step as pointed out to him by the train driver. He informed him that the step appeared to be bent back. He also viewed the CCTV from the train. The autopsy was carried out by Dr Erich Langner at Sligo University Hospital on June 15, 2023. Dr Langer said the deceased died of multiple injuries related to trauma from colliding with a train. The toxicology showed presence of alcohol, cocaine, diazepam and prescription drugs which may have been a major contributory factor. The Coroner said that in relation to a verdict and cause of death, he was bringing in a narrative verdict that Jessica McLoughlin died on June 14 2023 on the rail line at Knoxpark from injuries sustained from colliding with a train on the background of her having alcohol and drug intoxication. Mr MacGowan said he wished to give his sympathies to Jessica’s family, present at the inquest, and particularly her niece Rebecca who was with her and who he said was sure it was a difficult time for her. He said that Jessica was a young woman and it was such a shame. He said he also wanted to mention Padraig the train driver and wish him the best for the future. He said he did all that he could and could do nothing else. Sergeant Derek Butler on behalf of An Garda Síochána also expressed sincere condolence to the family. Mr Declan Hegarty (solicitor) on behalf of Iarnrod Éireann also offered sympathies to the family.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 3 1/2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Advertisement Advertisement",

You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 3 1/2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell's background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. \"We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Steve Megargee, The Associated Press",

History is made and we’re now on GOAT time ⏱️🐐 Congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo 🥳 pic.twitter.com/PKsEtBlU2L — AlNassr FC (@AlNassrFC_EN) May 27, 2024 Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil’s long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club’s final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb’s penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer’s strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho ultimately saw the hosts prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

Its level on May 27 remains below normal despite rains dumped by Typhoon “Aghon” over the weekend. —photo courtesy of Norzagaray Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office PLARIDEL, BULACAN, Philippines — The drop in the water level of Angat Dam and the plan to cut supply to rice fields by May 30 will not affect farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces who depend on the reservoir for their irrigation needs, a leader of a farmers’ group said. Despite Angat Dam’s current elevation of below 180 meters above sea level (masl), farmers would no longer require the water it supplies to their fields since many have harvested their rice crops since late April until early in the month, said Carlos Dimaapi, acting president of the more than 22,000 Angat Maasim River Irrigation System (Amris) farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga. READ: Angat Dam water level at 178 meters, still below operating level of 180 The continuous release of water by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) until May 30 will be enough to allow the remaining farmers to harvest good quality rice crops, he added in a phone interview on Friday. The farmers began planting for the dry season in December last year and January this year in time for the May harvest period. On Monday, because of the rains brought by Typhoon “Aghon” (international name: Ewiniar) over the weekend, the water level of Angat Dam reached 179.80 masl, slightly higher than its 178.86 masl on Sunday but still below its operating level of 180 masl and its spilling level of 212 masl. Liza Sacdalan, president of the Central Luzon Organic Rice Producers Association Inc. and the Plaridel-Guiguinto Irrigators Association that is under Amris, also affirmed they have no objection to cutting the water supply to their farms. “The cutoff is accepted because no one will need the supply. It is harvest season already until last week,” Sacdalan told the Inquirer in a text message on Sunday. Sacdalan said that despite the dry spell brought on by the El Niño phenomenon, which started last December and was projected to end by this month, many of them were still able to plant and harvest good crops because of enough water supply from the dam. Angat Dam supplies water to more than 27,000 hectares in the Bulacan towns of Norzagaray, San Rafael, Angat, Baliwag, Bustos, Plaridel, Calumpit, Pulilan, Hagonoy, Paombong, Bocaue, Bulakan, Pandi, Balagtas and Guiguinto and the City of Malolos; and the towns of San Simon, Apalit, San Luis and Candaba in Pampanga. NIA, which manages the dam’s water supplied to irrigated fields in the two provinces, regularly released 40 to 32 cubic meters per second volume of water to the fields since January, which it gradually reduced as the water level dropped.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Kanlaon recorded 24 volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes between 1:35 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on May 26, which occurred at depths of up to 6 kilometers beneath the western flank of its edifice.

READ: Fire at Mt. Kanlaon rages for 2 days now The ongoing VT earthquake activity indicated shallow rock-fracturing on the edifice, which may lead to further unrest, Phivolcs added. Phivolcs reminded the public that alert level 1 still prevailed over Kanlaon, indicating that the volcano’s condition remained abnormal. Kanlaon, which straddles Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, is one of the active volcanoes in the country and the highest peak in the Visayas (2,464.92 meters or 8,087 feet above sea level). —Carla P.

        "content": "Julie Amos (right) talking to her players during the rout of Malaysia. —CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Gilas Pilipinas crushed one opponent after another in Thailand to punch a return ticket to the Fiba U-18 Women’s Asia Cup Division B. The young Nationals cut Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia down to size, winning by a whopping average 37.3 points in the short tournament held in Ratchaburi province.Still, coach Julie Amos feels there is plenty of polishing that her charges could do right before they plunge into action in the main tournament set in Shenzen, China, late next month. “We have always emphasized attack mentality—that everyone should run and push the ball. We have been consistent on that. But I will continue to polish [the girls] offensively,” Amos, a member of the women’s program brain trust, told the Inquirer on Monday. “There were situations that we needed to slow down to see mismatches and needed timing,” she pointed out. “We [also] need to be more consistent with our rotations and individual stops.” Overall, Amos feels that Gilas needs to improve on its maturity as it’s a trait that will allow the squad to be patient in certain situations. It was, somehow, what the team lacked in its overtime meltdown against Malaysia in the Division B semifinals two years ago in Bangalore, India. Amos is steadfast in her belief that Gilas can apply the necessary tweaks just in time, especially with promising players at her disposal. Aside from the ever-improving Ava Fajardo and hands-down the tournament’s finest scorer, Alicia Villanueva, Amos sees a lot of promise in Gabby Ramos and Tiff Reyes. “[Gabby] has been so solid inside and out and really contributes well offensively and defensively. There was this one game where she made 29 points and 19 rebounds,” said Amos, adding Ramos is a “complete package” like Villanueva.

        "content": "Carlo Paalam.–CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Carlo Paalam’s Olympic route is marked with several stops at the ongoing World Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand. After making short work of Alexei Lagkazasvili of Greece in his opening bout in the men’s 57-kilogram division, Paalam’s next layover is the round of 32 on Tuesday where Turkmenistan’s Shukur Ovezov awaits. “I’ll just have to continue what I’ve started,’’ said Paalam in Filipino after his final shot for the 2024 Paris Olympics got going with a trouble-free 5-0 win over Lagkazasvili. The Tokyo Olympics silver medalist showed no trace of an injured shoulder in that fight and will climb the ring opposite Ovezov at Indoor Stadium Huamark fresh from a three-day rest.“Very good start for Carlo. It’s great to see him back from the shoulder injury,’’ said Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines secretary general Marcus Manalo. Paalam is looking to even up matters with Ovezov, who showed him the door in the first world Olympic qualifier in Busto Arsizio, Italy, two months ago. “Coincidentally, his next opponent will be the Turkmen whom he lost to due to injury. But he’s in good shape for now and moving very well,’’ said Manalo.Back then, the 25-year-old from Talakag, Bukidnon, was already nursing a painful shoulder in an earlier bout before dropping his round of 16 match against Ovezov. Mexico’s Andrey Bonilla slammed Paalam to the canvas in their round of 32 clash before the Filipino pugilist survived with a split-decision win.Out of the four Filipino boxers sent to Bangkok, only Paalam and Hergie Bacyadan are still in contention following the early exit of Rogen Ladon (men’s 51 kg) and Criztian Pitt Laurente (men’s 63.5 kg). Ladon dropped his initial bout against Spain’s Rafael Lozano and Laurente fell prey to a quicker Mukhammedsabyr Bazarbay Uulu of Kazakhstan in their round of 64 face-off.Bacyadan, another promising Olympic prospect, drew Spain’s Dunia Mas Martinez in her initial bout in the women’s 75-kg division. If she survives Martinez, the vovinam world champion from Kalinga should get past two more opponents on June 1 and June 2 to join Eumir Marcial (men’s 80 kg), Nesthy Petecio (women’s 57 kg) and Aira Villegas (women’s 50 kg) in the French capital in July. Paalam needs to beat three more opponents after Ovezov since only the medalists in his division will earn those Paris berths. Although rougher roads lay ahead, coaches Ronald Chavez and Elmer Pamisa, Paalam’s trainer as a youth in Cagayan de Oro City, are optimistic that their ward could weather the challenges.

        "content": "Christian Standhardinger (with ball) has been working hard on that mid-range game. —PBA IMAGES Around April last year, Christian Standhardinger candidly spoke about approaching the game differently in a bid to get the most out of his aging knees. A little over a year later, the Barangay Ginebra ace continues to play splendidly, emerging as the club’s foremost weapon in a grueling seven-game semifinal showdown with tough-as-nails Meralco in the PBA Philippine Cup. “You just try to read what the defense is giving you and that’s what it was,” he said, with his signature deadpan expression, after an 89-84 Game 5 victory at Mall of Asia Arena that had the crowd darlings taking control of the series. “Coach (Tim Cone) tells me to shoot [the basketball] if [I am] open. So obviously, I took it. But, it’s more about the decision-making,” he added. “The challenge for me—or for us—this semifinals run is they (the Bolts) change a lot of the coverage and I’m just trying to make the right reads and make the right decisions.” Standhardinger had 34 points and 10 rebounds that night, bringing his semifinal averages to 22.8 points and 9.8 rebounds. He could’ve easily had more if not for the effort he also puts into playmaking. The top pick of the 2017 Rookie Draft there is nothing drastic behind his sustained fine play this series. “My prep doesn’t change. But what I’ve changed is my reaction to what they do,” he said of the Bolts, who have been trying their darndest in putting up a challenge from the battle-hardened Raymond Almazan to rookie Brandon Bates. “I’m just trying to make the right reads and I think we have a great video analyst with Pat (Partosa) and the rest of the coaching staff. So just watching film, and listening to what they have to say, helps a lot, too,” he added. Cone, however, did not let Standhardinger continue to make his feat seem minor. “If you saw us in practice, you’ll see how much Christian works on that shot,” he said of his mid-range jumper which allowed the do-it-all forward to finish Game 5 with an efficient 12-for-17 shooting. “He has faith in [his shot], we have faith in it. And when guys are going to back off of him like they do [against] his drive, he’s going to be able to take that shot and make it. And he did that with a really high percentage tonight. That’s just through the really hard work that he does,” he added. INQ Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Alas Pilipinas libero Dawn Macandili-Catindig during an AVC Challenge CUp 2024 game. –MARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.net A little Faith turned Alas Pilipinas into an unpredictable force entering the semifinals of the AVC Challenge Cup. The national squad battles Kazakhstan on Tuesday at Rizal Memorial Coliseum with a championship berth at stake and will ride into that duel confident that it has a lot of weapons to counter a taller and more powerful opponent. “The bench is pretty deep. Everyone is ready to play and deliver, even Julia Coronel as a setter. It’s good for us because at least we’re a bit more unpredictable against our opponents,” ace playmaker Jia De Guzman told reporters on Sunday after dominating Chinese Taipei, 25-13, 25-21, 25-18, to complete a four-game sweep of Pool A. READ: Alas Pilipinas can win AVC Challenge Cup title says Jaja Santiago Already the first Philippine volleyball team to enter the AVC semifinals since joining the confederation’s tournaments in 1961, Alas Pilipinas gave De Guzman a different set of starters to work with against the Taiwanese. Faith Nisperos filled in for Angel Canino and delivered eight points to help out Eya Laure and Vanie Gandler in providing the firepower against the Taiwanese, proving that coach Jorge de Brito has a lot to work with if he hopes to pull of an upset against the Kazahks. “I want to maximize every chance I can get and get all the experience I can get, and show my skills every chance I can get,” the young wing spiker said after subbing for Canino, the team’s leading scorer. “I’m really grateful to get a chance and also my other teammates who played today,” she added. Nisperos and the team are unfazed by the test that now lies before them. “We have to accept every challenge and we’re going to face Kazakhstan [in the semis]. “We will make whatever effort we can do and show our teamwork. That would be our mindset [on Tuesday],” the former Ateneo ace and current Akari standout said. “We have a good mix of young players and veterans. It’s a good blend of fire, energy and composure,” De Guzman said. “We hope to maintain this until the end and learn from our past games because the elimination round was a good training ground for us. Hopefully, we can get better results going into the next round.” “Kazakhstan is a very strong team, very tall also. We experienced playing taller and stronger teams in our bracket, and we will prepare with coach Jorge on our training tomorrow,” she added.

The milestone the team completed is something the nationals can rest on. But they are ready for more “What we went through wasn’t easy and we know it won’t be easier in the future because the semifinals is a different level. We’re just going in with a positive mindset,” De Guzman said. INQ",

        "content": "Nearly 200,000 people in NI are at risk of or living with diabetes There are nearly 200,000 people in Northern Ireland who are living with or at risk of developing diabetes according to new figures from the Department of Health. The figures show that thre has been a 11.4% increase in the number of people in Northern Ireland who are registered with prediabetes, with 3,000 new registrations in the past 12 months. Prediabetes, also known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, is where a person’s blood sugars are higher than usual, but not high enough for them to receive a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

Prediabetes prevalence reporting was first introduced in last year’s report, indicating that 66,000 people were registered with prediabetes at that time. Diabetes UK Northern Ireland Interim National Director, Roxanne Small, said: “These new figures are significant in showing us that nearly 200,000 people are living with, or at risk of diabetes in Northern Ireland. In our work, we see first-hand how it is an incredibly tough and relentless condition that can have a huge impact on a person’s life – therefore, it is vitally important that people are aware of the resources and support available to help manage their health and wellbeing. “Whilst the reporting of prediabetes cases is relatively new for Northern Ireland, the increase we’ve seen over the last year is considerable. We strongly believe that greater awareness and reporting across the region have played a strong role in this rise. Prediabetes has been a real topic of conversation when speaking with members of the public as they are keen to understand more about it and how they may be able to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.” It is unlikely for people with prediabetes to experience any of the traditional diabetes symptoms (the 4Ts – Toilet, Thirsty, Tired, Thinner). For those who may have concerns, it is recommended that they contact their GP surgery to request a blood test. The most common test checks a person’s HbA1c levels, which are their average blood glucose levels over the last two to three months. HbA1c levels between 42mmol/mol – 47mmol/mol are considered higher than normal and suggest a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Roxanne continued, “We understand that for some people it may feel that a prediabetes diagnosis means that type 2 diabetes is certain, however, this is not always the case. While you may be at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, many people can reduce their risk, and it may be possible to prevent or delay the condition from developing. For anyone with concerns, we really encourage you to contact your healthcare team and reach out to our team for local support.

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "content": "Qatar has announced a contribution of $75mn to support humanitarian efforts and interventions for the Syrian people, adding to its contributions over the past years. This came in Qatar's speech delivered by HE Minister of State for International Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lolwah bint Rashid Al Khater, before the Syria donors conference held Monday in Brussels, Belgium. HE Al Khater expressed hope that the conference would result in appropriate financial commitments and that the multiplicity of humanitarian crises would not affect the pledges towards Syria and its people. She emphasized the importance and necessity of continuing this conference and all efforts aimed at mobilizing financial support and encouraging donors to persist, pointing out the need to face the facts and say that there has been an international and regional entrenchment of displacement and division. HE Al Khater explained that this entrenchment began years ago with policies that prolonged the conflict on a no-winner, no-loser basis. She pointed out that this continued to the present day with entrenched verbal positions that reality has surpassed, making the Syrian issue a seasonal topic without genuine and effective international and regional efforts to find practical and fundamental solutions. She noted that despite its harshness and many unique aspects, the Syrian crisis is not an unprecedented situation that cannot be compared to other conflicts, pointing out that the region and the world have experienced many brutal civil wars and conflicts. HE Minister of State for International Cooperation pointed out that experiences have shown that ending conflicts and civil wars requires strength, courage, and sincerity from the parties involved. She explained that even if these qualities are present, a decisive political settlement cannot be guaranteed without regional and international consensus, especially since the Syrian crisis has been internationalised for years.

Main accused Akhtaruzzaman Shaheen is suspected to have already fled to the US. During questioning, Jihad Howladar (24) - the butcher from Mumbai - said that the chopping of the body continued through the night on May 13 and they had consumed alcohol while doing the job. The next morning, Jihad walked out of the house in the MP's clothes as his own were stained with blood. State CID - in presence of a team from Dhaka Metropolitan Police led by its chief Md Harun-or-Rashid - completed a reconstruction of the murder at the Rajarhat flat. As per police sources, the MP entered the flat at 3pm accompanied by Faisal and Shimul Bhuniyan while leaving their shoes outside. Celesty Rahman was in the upstairs room.

Anita Anand, Treasury Board president, and Marci Ien, the minister for women and gender equity and youth, announced the funding at the Centre for Aging + Brain Health Innovation ( ) on Sunday. The federal government said the recipients were selected through a new competitive evaluation process that saw 55 letters of intent narrowed down to 34 full applications. Those were then evaluated by sub-committees and a technical review before a final decision was made by an independent 18-person expert review panel. Vancouver-based , which provides research services to public, private, and academic institutions, received the most funding at $218.1 million.

        "description": "Mexico is an increasingly important destination for gay tourists, so get ready for your Pride Month trip with our list of the best locations to party.The post A guide to Mexico’s hottest LGBTQ+ vacation destinations appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Are you considering a vacation to Mexico and wondering if Mexico is safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? And what is the current state of LGBTQ+ rights in Mexico? If you have your heart set on sipping authentic margaritas on a pristine beach, you’ll be delighted to know that gay rights in Mexico surpass those in many countries worldwide. Historically, Indigenous populations such as the Zapotec and Maya have long accepted sexual fluidity, and same-sex sexual acts were decriminalized in the country in 1871. Today, same-sex unions are federally recognized and same-sex marriages are performed in 18 of Mexico’s 31 states. LGBTQ+ couples are also free to adopt children. Thanks to a pair of rulings in 2015 and 2016 by Mexico’s highest judicial body, laws banning gay marriage and gay adoption in Mexico were declared unconstitutional. This year, Congress voted to ban so-called “conversion therapies.” Although Mexico is generally very gay friendly, it should be noted that some regions are more so friendly than others. Mexico City’s Zona Rosa — which spans 16 blocks and is home to more than 200 gay-owned businesses — rivals San Francisco’s Castro District. Other parts of Mexico, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Tijuana, are also considered extremely welcoming. Nowadays, a trip to Mexico often means visiting the country’s capital, so it’s worth asking: is Mexico City safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? The answer is yes. In fact, it may be one of the most gay-friendly cities in the Americas. The city’s annual Pride festival, which debuted in 1978, attracts several hundred thousand people, while other cities and towns also draw large crowds for annual festivities. Mexico is the sixth most visited vacation destination in the world, and most of the country is very LGBTQ+ friendly. But to make your gay vacation even more special, stay in a gay-friendly space. In Mexico, there are several cities and destinations known for being welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community. We’ve included some of the best below. Mexico’s capital is recognized as one of the most open and progressive cities in Latin America in terms of LGBTQ+ rights. There are many bars, clubs, restaurants and events aimed at the LGBTQ+ community in neighborhoods such as Zona Rosa and Condesa. Here are a few of its more famous bars: This Bajío city has a vibrant LGBTQ+ scene and is famous for its annual Pride march, which attracts thousands of people. Zona Chapultepec and Zona Rosa are popular areas for LGBTQ+ nightlife and events. Visit in February to get involved with Guadalajara’s month-long Carnival celebrations marking the start of Lent. Jalisco’s Pacific coast hub is a tourist destination known for its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. The Romantic Zone is the heart of the LGBTQ+ scene in Puerto Vallarta, with a wide variety of gay-friendly bars, clubs and restaurants. The city’s gay clubs are outstanding and always busy. There’s a huge variety of establishments, so you can enjoy everything from relaxed cocktail bars to strip clubs. Many bars also sell Purple Hand, a domestically produced beer marketed to the LGBTQ+ population. Winter sees Puerto Vallarta at its busiest , with top drag performers from Provincetown escaping the chill of the U.S. northeast and descending on the city’s myriad gay-run venues, bars and clubs. Although more conservative than the other cities on this list, Mérida has been developing an active and visible LGBTQ+ population in recent years. Neighborhoods such as Santiago and Santa Ana are known for being more welcoming. As for the gay bars Merida has in store, most are located downtown, on Calle 60, but it’s easy to meet like-minded people in the many cantinas, restaurants and bars around town, you’ll find acceptance and friendly tour operators to help ensure your time is memorable for all the right reasons. This Riviera Maya tourist destination has gained popularity among the LGBTQ+ population due to its relaxed and tolerant atmosphere. Quinta Avenida is the main place for nightlife and has several gay-friendly bars and clubs. This street is also home to the annual Playa Pride festival, a week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ culture and rights. These are just a few examples, but in general, most major cities and tourist destinations in Mexico tend to be quite inclusive and welcoming towards the LGBTQ+ community. The scene can vary by city and season, so it’s always a good idea to do some research before heading out and connecting with the local LGBTQ+ population by contacting local LGBTQ+ organizations or online communities to get insider tips on the best LGBTQ+ friendly establishments and events.

        "content": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 31⁄2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

(AP Photo/Morry Gash) MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 31⁄2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

He w as airlifted to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. The little cowboy was initially considered brain-dead but miraculously woke up from a coma. His devastated parents, Kallie and Spencer are praying for a miracle. Many in the community have been organizing fundraisers for Levi. On Saturday, the Junior Roughstock World Finals, Desert Region Rodeo, posted that each of the kids ' rode a little extra strong for Levi Wright.' Heartbreaking pictures showed the young riders on one knee, bowing their heads with cowboy hats in hand for a moments silence for little Levi. The young cowboys are pictured holding their hat and kneeling on the dirt in prayer for Levi Levi Wright, 3, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright, has been fighting for his life, since his toy tractor dove into a creek in Utah and he was found unresponsive 'Each of the kids wore blue rode for Levi,' the post read. 'They say this is the first rodeo of the entire season that each and everyone of the kids young roughstock riders had a little extra grit and try.' On the day of the ordeal, Kallie was outside watching her son playing on his tractor trailer, and ran into the house to check on her 9-month-old. Within that split second Levi had disappeared from sight. The frantic mother dove into the creek to look for her son in the raging river. Levi's devastated parents were preparing for the worst and said they planned to 'stop care and hold him close until his last breath on earth.' But, miraculously Levi woke from the coma on Thursday night, two days after he was initially expected not to survive. 'LEVI WOKE UP! I am shook, we don't know much but the doctor said it was okay for me to get excited about that and I AM! My baby is so tough!' she said. 'He got a little wild so we had to settle him down again but my heart!' On Friday, they received the devastating news that an MRI gave a poor prognosis for the youngster . At the advice of a new doctor, the parents were told to give their son some time. 'We have time for a miracle!' the family wrote on their Facebook after their son woke up. 'Levi's heart is beating on its own, he has a will to breathe but his sweet little brain was without oxygen too long and there is no coming back from that,' an earlier update read. Heartbreaking pictures showed the young riders on one knee, bowing their heads with cowboy hats in hand for a moments silence for little Levi Young cowboys are seen placing a plastic dinosaur on a barrel at the fundraiser for Levi Kids placed little toy dinosaurs on the contained during the rodeo final T-Rex Strong Like Levi - the precious illustration was made by a family friend Photos on social media show Kallie in her son's hospital bed cradling him in her arms, as his father stands nearby. On Sunday she wrote: 'This is an experience, I pray deep in my soul you never have to know the way I am beginning to. 'This is a roller coaster that you go on unwillingly & blindfolded, you do not know what's coming next. You just get to wait & ride it out. We are taking it day by day.' She shared the type of brain injury her son may sustain, and the unknowns that are ahead. 'The term 'Brain Injury' is very broad, there are ranges and different severities. No two brain injuries are alike, even if the accident is similar. No two brains recover or don't recover the same. 'There is a lot Medical Professionals don't know, but what they do tell you is based off legitimate medical literature and history.' Kallie Wright dived in to save her three-year-old son when he drove his toy tractor into the raging river Levi miraculously showed signs of brain function on Friday, but now his mother, Kallie Wright (left) is warning the hardest part of their journey has yet to come Kallie expressed how grateful she is for the guidance from her doctor, she said 'has provided us the most precious gift of time. Something we almost did not have.' 'Our doctor is nothing short of outstanding and I believe with all of me that her heart is invested into him. 'Whether that is time to see if God provides a miracle to us or whether it's time for us to research, learn and process this all in order to make the most informed decisions. In the heartbreaking post, she continued to ask for prayers and 'for years to come.' She said, as 'I fear we haven't even reached the hardest part of this.' 'Every decision that Levi's Dad and I will make will be made based on what, we the two people who know him best believe he would want. In all this, he comes first. 'We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us & getting as many professional eyes on this as possible.'

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

Even spilling Paulo Bernardo's strike in the Scottish Cup Final can't detract from that given his performances for the ten months before. 4 Jack Butland was beaten late on in Saturday's Cup Final Credit: Kenny Ramsay 4 But the keeper has been in top form at home and abroad all season Credit: Willie Vass 4 Tam McManus (left) think EPL clubs will come calling for the keeper But could it be his last act in the club colours? Former Hibs and Dundee striker Tam McManus thinks so. The pundit says Butland could be on his way this summer and reckons his agent will be courting clubs in the English Premier League given the standard of his performances in the SPFL. The keeper's form saw suggestions he could sneak back into Gareth Southgate 's England squad for next month's Euros and though he was considered, he just missed out on a recall .

And he tipped three teams - at least - who'd be interested in Butland, though reckoned the ex-Manchester United keeper could do even better for himself. He told PLZ Soccer : \"Every professional football player wants to get to the English Premier League now - it's the best league in the world, it's the richest league in the world. \"Everyone wants to go there and play.

He's probably a little bit better than that. \"I think he's maybe mid-table Premier League. Rangers hero Jack Butland tipped to join CELTIC by former Hoops goalkeeper \"He's played there before and knows how good the league is. \"For me, I think his agent will be touting him to other clubs. \"He's done great at Rangers and he's probably come up to Rangers to get himself back in the shop window and playing regularly to try and get himself back to the English Premier League... I think there will be a lot of teams.\" Nottingham Forest made a January bid for the 31-year-old which was rebuffed by the club before it even reached the keeper - who did likewise. 4 Butland was in top form at home and abroad for the Gers after signing last summer Credit: AFP And McManus also tipped an eight-figure sale that could make Gers think twice. He added: \"Rangers got him on a free so if you're talking £10m - that to Rangers is massive money .\" And if the pundit is right and Butland is on the move this summer it could have DOUBLE benefits for Old Firm rivals Celtic , if his prediction comes true.

        "content": "( KRON ) – Eric Ferguson was arrested for a sexual assault that was committed in 2002, according to the Oakley Police Department. Oakley PD received a notification from the Combine DNA Index System (CODIS) regarding a possible DNA match from a 2002 kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor in early May. The department subsequently coordinated with the U.S. Marshals Service and a Coeur d’Alene Police Department detective. The suspect was identified as 49-year-old Eric Ferguson, who was currently residing in Rathdrum, Idaho. Ferguson formerly lived in the east Contra Costa County area at the time of the rape. On May 12, Oakley detectives, along with the United States Marshals Service, Coeur d’Alene Police Department and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office, traveled to Idaho to serve a search warrant for DNA collection from Ferguson for the case. Oakley PD detectives returned to the Bay Area to ask the Contra Costa Sheriff’s Office Laboratory to compare the samples from the search warrant and the original case. According to Oakley PD, Ferguson’s DNA directly matched the DNA collected in 2002. A judge signed a formal complaint that was filed against Ferguson on May 16. The same day, the involved agencies utilized their SWAT team to apprehend Ferguson. Ferguson was arrested and booked into the Contra Costa County Jail for rape of an incompetent person, forcible oral copulation and kidnapping for rape.",

Actress Amanda looked glamorous in her one-shoulder gown which featured sleeves with attached gloves. The garment's material gathered to the front but it was for another reason that fans of the show focussed their attention on the dress - many took to social media to note that they could see her nipples through the material. They joked it must have been cold in London's Hammersmith Apollo where the semi-final was taking place.

        "description": "Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations.The post Indian Elections: Implications for Regional Stability first appeared on Kashmir Times (Since 1954): Multi-media web news platform..",
        "content": "Altaf Hussain Wani* The world is awaiting the outcome of India’s general elections with a bated breath. The seven-phase elections will come to conclusion on June 1 and counting of votes is scheduled to take place on June 4. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under Modi’s leadership, is aiming for a third consecutive term and has set a target of over 370 seats. Media outlets that support Modi and his Hindutva philosophy predict a landslide victory for the BJP. However, independent observers believe that the opposition alliance, known as INDIA Bloc, may still pose a significant challenge, contrary to the narrative pushed by government-aligned media. While it is too early to predict the election results with certainty, one can speculate on how India’s future may unfold depending on which of the two main contenders emerges victorious. Impartial observers, who have been closely monitoring Modi’s iron-fisted rule, view the prospect of a third term as a potential risk to peace and stability in South Asia. They argue that another term for Modi could amplify India’s global ambitions and regional hegemony. The ruling party has consistently expressed its commitment to “Akhand Bharat”, a concept championed by Hindu nationalist parties that has raised concerns among India’s neighbours. A mural in the new parliament building in New Delhi, depicting ‘ancient India’ including regions now part of Pakistan and other countries, exemplifies the BJP’s promotion of this expansionist ideology. India’s neighbours have been critical of this project and are genuinely worried about the threats it poses to their territorial sovereignty. The idea of restoring the territorial unity of the Indian subcontinent under a unified Hindu-majority nation is not universally accepted and has sparked considerable controversy. This concept is supported by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP. A potential third term for the BJP is also seen as a continuation of the erosion of India’s secular and democratic principles. During Modi’s ten-year tenure, India’s secular credentials have faced substantial criticism. Since 2014, Indian society has witnessed a surge in communal conflicts, violent incidents, and an increase in xenophobia, intolerance, racism, and discrimination. Key events such as the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Ayodhya verdict and subsequent construction of the Ram Temple, appointments of Hindu nationalist sympathisers to significant positions, infusion of Hindu ideology into education and culture, restrictions on minority rights and freedoms, biased policies against Muslims and other minorities, erosion of secular institutions, and the judiciary’s apparent alignment with the BJP’s agenda have profoundly undermined India’s secular democracy. The consequences of a third term for Modi could be far-reaching and damaging to India’s secular fabric, democratic institutions, and social cohesion. Here are some potential outcomes: Hindu nationalist ideology may become further entrenched, marginalising minority communities and undermining the principles of equality and justice. #The judiciary, media, and other institutions may face increased pressure to conform to the BJP’s agenda, compromising their independence and integrity. #The concept of Hindutva (Hindu-ness) may become even more dominant, potentially leading to a formal declaration of India as a Hindu state. #Muslims, Christians, and other minorities may face heightened discrimination, violence, and exclusion from the political and social mainstream. #The promotion of Hindu-centric education, history, and culture may accelerate, suppressing diverse perspectives and India’s pluralistic heritage. #Dissent may be met with increased surveillance, censorship, and repression, silencing critical voices and undermining democratic freedoms. #The polarisation and fragmentation of Indian society may worsen, potentially leading to increased communal tensions, violence, and social unrest. #The very foundations of India’s secular democracy, enshrined in the Constitution, may be challenged or even rewritten to accommodate the BJP’s ideology. #A permanent shift towards authoritarianism may make it challenging for opposition parties to restore democratic values, secularism, and the rule of law in the future. The BJP’s stringent stance on the Jammu and Kashmir issue has resulted in heightened tensions with Pakistan, raising the possibility of escalating conflict. Additionally, India’s growing rivalry with China could lead to increased military build-up and tensions in the region. India’s aspirations for regional influence might result in a more assertive approach towards its smaller neighbours, potentially disrupting the balance of power in the region. The expansionist agenda of the BJP could escalate tensions with neighbouring nations. However, the impact of India’s emergence as a regional hegemon under the BJP will depend on how it chooses to exercise its power and influence in the region. If Narendra Modi secures a third term, his government’s policies in Jammu and Kashmir may include: #Continued crackdown on dissent , leading to increased tensions and potential human rights violations. #Increased security measures, with additional security forces and strict measures to maintain control and prevent unrest . #Promotion of Hindu nationalism, potentially altering the demographics of the region. These actions could result in the continued exclusion of the Kashmiri population and heightened polarisation and marginalisation of the majority community. Conversely, a victory for the INDIA Bloc alliance is expected to steer the country back towards secularism, protect minority rights, and recalibrate its relationships with neighbouring countries. India needs stable leadership and a unifying approach to move away from the politics of anarchy and polarisation. In just a few days, the world will learn whether Indians have voted in favour of a progressive alliance or a party that has thrived on falsehoods and communal frenzy. Tailpiece: India’s regional influence may have expanded under BJP leadership, but its advancement as a regional power remains a distant dream due to formidable challenges and competition from other regional powers. India’s aspiration to assume a leadership role in the region depends on its ability to address domestic challenges, strengthen relationships with neighbouring countries, and resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir. *The author is the chairman of the Islamabad-based think tank, Kashmir Institute of International Relations (KIIR). —–",

        "content": "Inter Milan CEO Beppe Marotta feels that critics of the Nerazzurri are “jealous” of the club’s success, and that the club is in good shape. Speaking at the Inter Club party, as reported by FCInterNews , the Nerazzurri executive was also confident about the contract extension of captain Lautaro Martinez despite the recent words from the Argentine’s agent. Inter are currently in a period of transition. The Nerazzurri have just changed owners. Last week, Oaktree Capital took over the club from Suning. This has raised some doubts about the future plans at Inter. Even the future of CEO Marotta, whose work has been pivotal for the past few years, has been in some question. And then there have been recent reports regarding the status of a contract extension for Inter captain Lautaro Martinez. The 26-year-old’s current deal runs out at the end of June 2026. And despite negotiations that have been going on for month, he has yet to pen an extension. However, Inter CEO Marotta is not worried about any of this. The executive was in a confident mood as he spoke to reporters. Inter Milan CEO Beppe Marotta Hits Out At “Jealous” Critics Marotta said that “I can guarantee you that there will be total continuity in the management iof the club. “I want to make clear that those who speak against us are driven by jealousy, and spread biased news that portrays a club in disarray,” the Inter CEO continued. “But Inter is a club that’s alive and well, and in great shape,” Marotta said. “Rest assured,” the executive added. “With your help and the support of the players and the coach who are all top professionals, we can get great results. “I think Inter should be considered one of the strongest teams in the world,” Marotta added. “And we have to have the courage to aim high with our goals.” Confidence On Lautaro Martinez Extension Despite Agent’s Comments Meanwhile, Marotta also gave his thoughts on the contract extension talks with captain Martinez. “We’re in regular talks with his agent,” the Inter CEO said. “And agents always have their own interests to look after,” he aimed with a dig at Martinez’s agent Alejandro Camano . The Inter captain’s agent has given a couple of recent interviews in which he has hinted without much subtlety that the striker is seeking a larger pay increase than Inter have so far offered. “However, I’m optimistic. Because every day Lautaro shows that he wants to stay here.” “It’s not something that’s just going to get wrapped up in a few days,” Marotta cautioned. “But we should certainly have his contract extended by the start of pre-season training,” the executive made very clear.",

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 21:26 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:46 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Marcus Rashford has taken the decision to remove himself from social media in the wake of a season that he's labelled 'challenging.' The Manchester United forward has endured a dramatic week at the end of a difficult season, and has seen him decide to take a complete rest from glare of social media to reset himself mentally. Last week he was left out of Gareth Southgate 's final England squad ahead of Euro 2024 , after a season where he has scored just eight goals for his club. The campaign has finished on a high note for the 26-year-old, as he helped United triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup Final on Saturday, but Rashford says he now needs a rest. Posting on his X account, he admitted it was time to come off the platforms and spoke of the support he's received from fans, and had a message for those who have not stood by him this season. Marcus Rashford has decided to take a break from social media following a challenging season The Man United forward did finish the campaign on a high note by winning the FA Cup His performances this season has seen him axed from England's squad for Euro 2024 Rashford wrote: 'It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. 'I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. 'To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.' The post comes days after Rashford was seen in tears at the end of the FA Cup Final win, as the pure emotion of a difficult season poured out of the striker. His performances have been largely criticised this season, and so much so, it's led to a snub from England manager Gareth Southgate - someone who's always been a big supporter of the striker. Asked about his decision to axe Rashford for the tournament in Germany, Southgate stated that be believed other players in his positions have just had better seasons than the Red Devils man. Rashford has scored just seven league goals all season, compared to the 17 he got last season - 30 in all competitions. His season has also been marred with off the field issues, after he embarked on a 12-hour tequila bender in Belfast back in January and then reported ill for United training. The message Rashford sent to announce his break off social media after a difficult season The emotions of the season all come to the surface in United's FA Cup victory over Man City The antics did not go down with United fans, who despite the FA Cup win have also suffered a disappointing season, finishing in their worst-ever league position . The United forward has also has to deal with the deaths of two people within his circle of family and friends, something his mother admitted during an interview with The Times, 'set him back a lot'. His performances this season has led to speculation he could be one of the big names to be sacrificed this summer, with Rashford linked with a possible move to Paris Saint-Germain . Following his post, United fans showed support for a player they've taken to calling 'king' with messages looking forward to next season with the player still at the club.

        "content": "An 81-year-old man who investigators say terrorized a southern California neighborhood for years with a slingshot has been arrested, police said. While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter”, the Asuza police department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested on Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40km) east of Los Angeles, police said. The Azusa police Lt Jake Bushey said on Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group. The man was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A strong political ally of former President Buhari and the Chairman of Arewa Media Group, AbdulMajid Danbilki Kwamanda, has warned President Bola Tinubu against allowing anyone to violate court orders that stopped the reinstatement of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II . He insisted that the reinstatement of Sanusi has set a bad precedent that could affect everyone. Speaking to newsmen in Kano on Monday, Kwamanda argued that the reinstatement of the deposed Emir violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution. According to him, “ We cannot understand why the people who celebrated and effectively used the courts to maintain their government now stand firmly against a substantive court order preventing them from carrying out illegality.” “The insistence that the reinstated Emir must stay and continue parading himself as the authentic Emir of Kano violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution and general well-being.” To this end, the political ally of former President Buhari called on Tinubu to urgently intervene in the matter to bring peace and stability to the state. He said, “ Although I’m a politician, honestly, this time around, politics aside, there is great danger in what the Kano State Government is doing. The court injunction must be respected to allow peace to reign. “Why is controversy associated with the reinstated Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II? Look at how he was removed from office by former President Goodluck Jonathan and the reasons for his removal. Now, are you returning him to continue anarchy in Kano or what?” Danbilki Kwamanda urged President Tinubu to act accordingly as a respecter of law and order, a reputation he is known for. “ You should not allow this bad precedent to be set during your tenure. You should ensure that everyone respects the law by stopping the reinstatement,” he added.",

        "content": "In recent years, “Jaws” star Richard Dreyfuss has come under fire for speaking out on subjects such as Oscar diversity requirements and the use of Blackface. At a “Jaws” retrospective screening in Beverly, Mass. on Saturday evening, he appeared to take his inflammatory remarks even further as he ranted about subjects reported to include trans people, Barbra Streisand and women in general. The Cabot sent an email to patrons to ticket purchasers, according to New Bedford, Mass. radio station WBSM, and apologized for comments it characterized as “offensive and distressing.” According to WBSM, which obtained the email from a patron, it read: “Dear Cabot Patrons, I am writing to address an important matter concerning last night’s event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot. We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss’s comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize. At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused. We are taking immediate steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. This includes more rigorous vetting of our event participants and more proactive communication strategies to keep our audience informed. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of The Cabot. We value your feedback and are dedicated to learning from this experience to better serve our community.” In a video an attendee posted to YouTube, Dreyfuss comes onstage to applause while a Taylor Swift song plays, wearing a dress over his clothes, which stagehands then remove before he sits down. Facebook commenters expressed anger over his comments, characterizing them as “vile, dehumanizing, abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women and survivors of sexual violence.” “A young family with a 10 year old daughter had to leave,” recounted another commenter. Dozens of patrons reportedly walked out of the venue. After the screening, another video posted to YouTube. shows him talking about a book he published in 2022. “Why don’t you tell us about your new book?” the moderator says. “It’s called ‘One Thought Scares Me,'” Dreyfuss answers, “And it’s about how 50 years ago, without telling anyone, they took civics out of the curriculum. Which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are.” His remarks are met with applause from the remaining moviegoers. Dreyfuss could not immediately be reached for comment during the holiday weekend. Representatives for the Cabot did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.",

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Midfielder Marten de Roon has been ruled out of the European Championship after being injured playing for Atalanta in the Italian Cup final, the Dutch football association said in statement on Monday. The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. (Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday accused the National People’s Power (NPP) of attempting to sabotage the plans to hold a debate between the leaders and economic councils of the parties. In a letter to the NPP he accused the rival of employing diversionary tactics to prevent the scheduled debates between the economic council and party leaders from proceeding as intended. Bandara in the letter requested the NPP to provide a date for the debate between the Economic Councils. Bandara stressed the importance of initiating discussions on the economic policies of both parties amidst the current economic challenges facing the country. He emphasised the need to prioritise these discussions through the Economic Council debate. “Despite our readiness to engage in a leadership debate as proposed by your party, it is perplexing that you are now seeking to evade the Economic Council debate. We have readily accepted your proposal for a leadership debate without any reluctance. However, we are puzzled by the lack of clarity regarding your party’s stance on the fundamental proposal for the debate, especially considering the various proposals put forward intermittently,” he noted. Bandara reiterated the SJB’s stance that the economic discourse should precede the leadership debate, as originally suggested. “Hence, we implore you to promptly finalise the date for the Economic Committee debate from the provided options. Furthermore, we extend another invitation to work together in coordinating both discussions, encompassing the selection of appropriate channels, moderators, and all essential arrangements,” he said.",

The RTÉ star also announced who his replacement will be in his absence.

He shared the news live on air earlier today. \"Kathryn will talk to you next week, that is it from us,\" he said on his afternoon show. The Ray D'Arcy Show airs Monday to Friday on RTÉ Radio 1 from 3pm until 4.30pm. Kathryn is no stranger to the afternoon slot and she regularly fills in for Ray during his time off, especially during the summer months. Brendan Courtney has also stepped in for him in the past. Ray's salary, along with his colleague's pay packets, made the headlines during the RTÉ payment scandal last summer. He recently revealed that he was \"angry\" during this tense time. \"If you ask anybody, would they like their salary published in the national papers, they wouldn't like it. You'd prefer that that wasn't the case, but it was,\" he told the RTE Guide. \"I was very honest at the time, I came out and told people what I was on, and I was in the commercial sector for 14 years, so I know what the salaries are outside of RTÉ and therein lies a story that's never told, because it doesn't suit the narrative.\" Kathryn's hit TV show Operation Transformation won't return in 2025. The health and wellness programme was on screens for 17 seasons. \"It has been an incredible privilege to be a part of Operation Transformation for the past 14 years and I am so so proud of the legacy the show is leaving behind. \"To be able to shine a national spotlight on the importance of looking after our health through our amazing leaders, ordinary people living ordinary lives, who opened up their hearts and homes in the most extraordinary ways.",

        "description": "Starting pitcher Cooper Criswell gives up seven runs in four innings and Boston drops to 0-4 against Baltimore this season.",
        "content": "Starting pitcher Cooper Criswell delivers a pitch during the Red Sox’s 11-3 loss to the Orioles on Monday in Baltimore. Criswell allowed seven runs (six earned) on six hits in four innings Nick Wass/Associated Press BALTIMORE — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBI, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. WHO: Boston Red Sox (Bello 5-2) at Baltimore Orioles (Rodriguez 5-1) WHEN: 6:35 p.m. Tuesday TELEVISION : NESN Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston’s Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. “It was fun for me to have a big day, fun for the team to get a win,” Stowers said. “Just cool to have a big moment.” Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs – six earned – over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles’ six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. “He was OK,” Boston Manager Alex Cora said. “Not too many swing and misses. They did a good job taking away certain pitches, and they put good swings on it.” Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore’s Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup. But he made the most of his 33rd career start, and fourth since his most recent recall from Triple-A Norfolk. “A lot more comfortable,” Stowers said. “Playing with a lot of confidence, a lot of gratitude. And honestly just playing, just playing the game.” After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out in the fourth, and drove Criswell’s 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn’t retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore’s lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox’s Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks, and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. “It took a couple innings to get back to feeling kind of like myself,” Irvin said. “But all and all, battled through that and the last two innings felt like myself again.” TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O’Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

More often than not, in-game battle passes are ridiculed by a game’s player base since they cost money and frequently only offer cosmetic upgrades. However, Embark Studios seems to be on a mission to change the narrative surrounding these microtransactions, as The Finals fans are calling the FPS’s battle pass offering “the best implementation” they’ve seen. Much like its counterparts in other games, though, also requires you to shell out your hard-earned cash to purchase it. However, the main difference is that grinding it out doesn’t feel as much of a chore. According to , they were able to max out the latest season’s BP even without playing often – a difficult feat if you were to do the same on a game like 2023’s Modern Warfare 3. Several commenters below the same thread similarly praised the game’s BP, with one calling it the “ .” Of course, The Finals battle pass isn’t without its imperfections – some players are hoping that the developers introduce “ ” and accessories with the next edition. But having a BP that’s easy to complete and doesn’t feel like a chore gives Embark Studios a leg up over the competition and a solid foundation to build upon for future iterations. It’s also worth noting that with arriving soon, the developers will introduce more player content, like cosmetics, accessories, and game modes. This includes the flashy and that players have been anticipating since Embark Studios teased them, so there’s plenty to look forward to in the near future.

        "content": "The French star is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season and it will bring a nine-year stay at the Manchester club to an end. The 28-year-old moved to Man United from Monaco as part of a in 2025 and made a lightning-quick start to life in the Premier League, scoring on his debut against United’s bitter rivals Liverpool. However, life at Man United would not go to plan for Martial as it has been a very frustrating nine years at the Premier League giants. The French star would suffer from several injuries but overall, the forward never seemed good enough. The United star would even spend time on loan with Sevilla during the 2021/22 campaign. Nevertheless, the 28-year-old would go on to play 317 times for the English giants, scoring 90 goals and producing a further 47 assists. Although things have not always been perfect for Martial at Old Trafford, the forward took to social media to pen an emotional letter to fans of Man United. Anthony Martial pens letter to Man United fans Martial took to Instagram to confirm his exit from Man United on Monday and also to say goodbye to fans of the Premier League giants. The 28-year-old wrote via : “Dear Manchester United fans. It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me.” Martial continued by saying: “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. “Thank you again for everything, and see you soon.”",

Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Basketball Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, died Monday, May 27, 2024, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was 71. (AP Photo/Jack Smith, File) Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "Chad’s newly appointed Prime Minister, Allamaye Halina, unveiled his inaugural government on Monday, signalling the conclusion of a three-year period of military governance in the arid nation. Naija News reports that the cabinet decree, broadcasted on public television, retained senior ministers who are predominantly supporters of President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Halina, a former ambassador to China, assumed office on Thursday, just prior to junta leader Deby’s presidential inauguration following a disputed election victory. The new government will consist of 35 ministers, with 23 individuals carrying over from the previous administration. Halina succeeded his predecessor, Succes Masra, who resigned last Wednesday after losing the presidential election. Masra, an economist, held office for only four months. Notably, none of the ministers from Masra’s Transformers party were included in the new government lineup. Deby officially secured 61% of the vote on May 6, a result criticized by international NGOs as lacking credibility and freedom. His main opponent denounced it as a “masquerade.” Before taking office, Deby announced a restoration of the constitutional system and committed to being a president for all Chadians, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs. It is important to remember that Deby assumed the role of interim president in April 2021, following the assassination of his father, President Idriss Deby Itno, by rebel forces after ruling for three decades.

Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Basketball Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, died Monday, May 27, 2024, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was 71. (AP Photo/Jack Smith, File) Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "By ZEKE MILLER AP White House Corresponde nt WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "Former member of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Yusuf, has revealed that it might be impossible for Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar to work together in the 2027 presidential election. Naija News reports that Yusuf, who was speaking on the premise of recent possible merger talks between Obi and Atiku, argued that he does not see the possibility of a merger between the two politicians. He said, “They worked together before in 2019, so it would not be out of place if they worked together again. However, I am not in their mind, but I do not see the possibilities. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Atiku Abubakar came out to say he would continue to contest as long as he is alive and healthy, to me that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with a notion that Atiku Abubakar might step down; shelve his political ambition for Peter Obi, but the follow-up statement a week later clarified that. “So I believe that Atiku Abubakar is going to contest I believe that Peter Obi is going to contest in 2027 if the two of them can create a compromise, fantastic for the opposition but i doubt if such will happen. “I love the statement made by the spokesperson of the Obi campaign organisation here, he clearly stated that this talk individuals have to be subjected to the individual’s parties, so we will now sit down, which of the parties should be the leading party, naturally it should be the PDP, but is Peter Obi ready to play second fiddle in this arrangement and will Peter Obi still have his base with him if he ceases to be presidential candidate those are the things you need to look into.”",

        "content": "Retired rapper and media personality found himself in the news for the wrong reasons. This was after his ex-girlfriend Tahiry Jose reacted to his comments on 's apology video. The embattled rap mogul Diddy offered a public statement apologizing following the disturbing video of 's assault, leading to scrutiny both online and among his peers. One of those who . During an episode of his , Joe said Diddy's actions in the assault video disgusted him, describing it as unbearable to watch. Joe added that Diddy's apology was offensive, insensitive, and felt almost like a slap in the face. Joe added, \"He didn't even try to put some sincerity into this thing.\" However, when posted Joe's thoughts on , his ex-girlfriend Tahiry Jose hopped to the comment section to level some accusations against him. She recalled how Joe allegedly threw her down a flight of stairs. This caused a back-and-forth between the exes, leading many to recall their relationship. Below is a timeline of their relationship. Joe Budden and Tahiry Jose's relationship began in 2005. During an interview with 's Brittany Lewis, Joe and Tahiry opened up about their first date. They revealed that they were together from the first time they met. Joe needed to use the bathroom and asked to use Tahiry's. However, after she let him in, he used the bathroom and fell asleep on her floor and they never stopped hanging out afterward. Joe and Tahiry also revealed that their first date was at a cave-shaped restaurant where they went to get ice cream. Joe and Tahiry loved each other and had a strong bond. However, these weren't enough to stop them from quarreling multiple times and even breaking up twice. This caused their relationship to become tumultuous as they made several allegations against each other. Fans watched Joe and Tahiry's relationship struggles play out on , which they starred in. Tahiry spoke about her and Joe's relationship struggles during a November 2013 chat with . When asked if she would ever trust Joe Budden enough to be with him long-term, she answered, \"Right now, no.\" She added, \"The world thinks Joey and I went back and forth for nine years [but] we didn't. We were together five, apart for four and I gave him a chance in May [but] he f***ed up. Tahiry explained that friendship is the core of every relationship, but Joe failed as a friend a few times. Despite the difficulties in his relationship with Tahiry, Joe was convinced she was the one for him. Hence, he planned a surprise proposal at New York City's Times Square. Family and friends surrounded the couple during the proposal, which also played out on an episode of . During the proposal, Joe told Tahiry that he wanted his words to match his actions and his actions to match his feelings for her. \"I want the ties that bind us together to always be stronger than those that tear us apart -- I love you,\" Joe said. \"I need you, I don’t want to spend another day without you. With that said, Tahiry-my-mom-didn’t-give-me-a-middle-name-Jose, will you marry me?\" Many would have thought Tahiry would say yes to the ring, but she turned down Joe's proposal. She had her reasons, though, as she questioned Joe's trustworthiness. Tahiry's actions hurt Joe, who spoke about the proposal during an appearance on . Joe revealed much was edited from the proposal scene on . The media mogul explained, \"I’m mad that they edited so much out.\" He explained further, \"In the scene that I shot with my mom afterward—you know, I expressed how the answer didn’t take away from how beautiful the night was for me. With the family there.\" Joe continued, \"And just leading up to it. And the ring. And just wedding planning. All that was great, still... It was great for a man to do. Like when you feel that way and to actually do it, sans the 'no.'\" When asked if he would ever be in a relationship with Tahiry, Joe declared, \"No way. No way. I'm never doing that again. That would never happen again. Ever ever ever ever.\" Meanwhile, during a December 2019 appearance on . When asked if she regretted rejecting the proposal, she said, \"Well, he proposed in a public place so, I mean... I don't regret it. I didn't know that I was that brave. It was one of the most important chapters of my life on national TV. I believe that the show had 5.1 million viewers at the time. So, to be able to say 'no' to the man I thought at that moment was supposed to be my forever was big.\" Tahiry further explained that she was uncomfortable with the amount of reality TV obligations she would have to deal with if she had said yes. Hence, she chose to do what was best for her. She added, \"I knew that that ring would come with show specials, the wedding specials... we were so big! People loved us together, but I couldn't do it. [It was] what my gut told me to do, so I had to follow my gut. None of that mattered if the relationship wasn't healthy.\" Tahiry emphasized that she made the right choice. She said, \"I have no regrets. Of course, I love him. I love him as a person.\" Tahiry and Joe went their separate ways after she turned down his marriage proposal. However, that wasn't the end of their interactions. In August 2020, Tahiry was a guest on and she revealed Joe allegedly abused her during their relationship. At the time, Tahiry was facing media scrutiny after her ex, , grabbed her forcefully during a episode. When asked if Joe was abusive toward her when they dated. Tahiry paused for a while before revealing that Joe allegedly abused her. Tahiry said she kept quiet about Joe's abuse because she wanted to focus on work. She claimed that her relationship with Joe left her battered and bruised. She revealed, \"That relationship left me with a fractured rib, a broken nose because somebody was sending him a message....pushed me down a flight of stairs. I remember having a plan to leave because the reason he was so upset was because I was already leaving. Looking through my phone and sh-t. But I had already told him give me two weeks to pack up my things and he agreed to it. Then he started looking through my phone. Next thing you know, I got woken up by him dragging me from my ankle.\" The reality TV star claimed that Joe began by verbally abusing her. It then turned to emotional abuse before becoming physical. She shared, \"I still fear for my safety. He hurt me bad and I just stayed quiet.\" Tahiry revealed that she lied to the doctors about her injuries, but Joe rapped about abusing her, and she stayed quiet. She explained that she wanted to deal with the matter privately, but listening to Joe saying she would fight a man after her altercation with Vado pushed her to speak out. Joe didn't waste time in denying Tahiry's abuse allegations against him. The broadcaster said his relationship with Tahiry was toxic. However, he accused her of lying against him and chasing clout with her accusations. Joe claimed Tahiry was abusive toward him and used to \"beat my a*s.\" He also claimed that he didn't break Tahiry's nose, noting that she got the injury after a fisticuff with a man in Sin City, New York. Joe said, \"What was alleged here...let me start with this young lady is a liar, a cancerous, toxic liar. I’m uncertain why she’s lying this way, I’m not certain if she’s misspeaking. If she has a false recollection of things. I’m not sure what it is but she said some things that didn’t sit right in my soul and I’m here to talk about it.\" Among other things, Joe further insinuated that Tahiry was in her feelings about him moving on from her and suggested the backlash she received after the drama caused her to tell lies about him. Tahiry responded to Joe's comments during an Instagram Live section with her friend Alicia Lyons. She noted that she prefers keeping her private affairs away from the public. She added, \"But, you know, the world believes whatever they want to believe. I’m fine. I know what happened. My God knows what happened. He knows what happened. So that’s why I don’t care. It’s like the party that’s guilty to jump on that bandwagon of everything that kind of supports their story.\" She also denied hitting Joe, saying, \"So Tahiry’s aggressive, yeah, I’m loud. I’m Dominican, I’m short, I’m rough, I’m aggressive but I never put my hands on you. But people don’t know that. They see what they see and that’s okay, too.\" Nothing much was heard about Joe and Tahiry's allegations against each other until May 22, 2024. Joe reacted to Diddy's apology video by bashing the rap mogul. However, Tahiry found Joe's comments ironical and hopped on 's repost to . She wrote, \"FOH, Who???? The irony. This is so triggering!!!!! I remember joey throwing me down a flight of stairs dragging me back into the house & me having to talk him into letting me go.\" She also claimed the situation remained that way \"FOR HOURS!!!!\" In a third comment, Tahiry expressed solidarity with Cassie and every other woman who went through or was going through abuse. However, Joe responded to Tahiry under the comment section of post. He called her a \"lying, failed gold digger that has abused, targeted and manipulated many men.\" Joe further said that Tahiry didn't have an identity outside of him which is why she has desperately tried to be attached to him for over 15 years. He recalled several instances they interacted with each other and she was fine. Joe claimed, \"You were on my body your entire last stint on and tried your best to disrespect my son's mother in the process, i had to ask producers to keep you away from us like the cancer you are!! Yet you continue to slight my name online because...it's your identity.\" Joe concluded by labeling Tahiry a con woman and prayed she would find healing and move on. He hoped this would be their last exchange and prayed for women who were really victims of abuse. Tahiry quickly responded to Joe's comments by claiming Joe's close circle knew the truth. She wrote, \"I'm not scared of you anymore. You can keep bullying, intimidating the rest. Those that know you and are around you also know the truth. Sad that they continue to enable your behavior. Your time is coming!\" Joe is yet to respond to Tahiry's latest comments and seems to be done talking about the matter. At this time, there is no love lost between the former lovebirds. However, only time will tell if Tahiry's allegations against Joe would be proven or if the issue at hand would fizzle out. [ ] [ ]",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after crashing to a straight sets loss, 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3, against fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday (local time). \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris when he'll turn 38. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Rafael Nadal acknowledges the crowd in Paris. Photo: Reuters On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. Alexander Zverev is in great form after winning the Rome Masters. Photo: Reuters \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. Never far from physical issues in his glittering career, Nadal missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio. He had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of Roland Garos. The 22-Grand-Slam winner said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics. \"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay. \"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\" Sinner and Swiatek through In other first round matches, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics. In the women's matches, Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title in Paris, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in the French capital following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.",

(“Canacol” or the “Corporation”) (TSX: CNE; OTCQX: CNNEF; BVC: CNEC) is pleased to provide the following update regarding scheduled interest payment, termination of Fitch Ratings coverage, and exploration drilling program. On May 24, 2024, Canacol paid its scheduled semi-annual interest payment of US $14.375 million on its November 2028 Senior Notes. On Tuesday, May 21, 2024, the Corporation informed Fitch Ratings that it was terminating its contract for the provision of ratings coverage. The Corporation retains the services of both Moody’s and S&P Ratings. The Corporation is preparing to drill the Cardamomo-1 exploration well located in the northern part of its 100% operated VIM-5 Exploration and Production (“E&P”) contract situated approximately 25 kilometers to the north of its Jobo gas processing facility. The Cardamomo-1 exploration well will target potential gas bearing sands within the Cienaga de Oro (“CDO”) reservoir, in a large well defined structural closure identified on the Redoblante 3D seismic survey acquired in 2023. Similar to all of the other large discoveries the Corporation has made in the past, including the Clarinete, Nelson, Aguas Vivas, and Pandereta gas fields, the Cardamomo prospect exhibits a well-defined AVO attribute, a seismic characteristic commonly associated with the presence of gas within the CDO reservoir. The Corporation plans to spud the well in late July 2024, and anticipates that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to drill and complete the well. Given success, the Cardamomo field will be tied into the Alboka flowline located approximately 12 kilometers to the south. The Cardamomo prospect is one of 14 CDO exploration prospects identified on the newly acquired Redoblante 3D seismic survey, and should it prove successful will open up a new productive gas area for the Corporation within the northern part of the VIM-5 E&P contract. Canacol is a natural gas exploration and production company with operations focused in Colombia. The Corporation’s common stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the OTCQX in the United States of America, and the Colombia Stock Exchange under ticker symbol CNE, CNNEF, and CNEC, respectively.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that a “tragic mistake” was made in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that set fire to a camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah were \"heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,\" the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into possible violations of international law, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of property crimes and looting were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, a ruling it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war. Israeli leaders also say they face an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes. Severe hunger is widespread, and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

A not-so-gentle breakup trend called ‘delicate dumping’ has become the go-to weapon for toxic lovers who want to split from their partners.

Napoli are looking to strengthen their defensive options ahead of the 2024-25 campaign, as senior figures within the club feel that they have not yet adequately replaced Kim Min-jae, who left for Bayern Munich shortly after the Serie A title win at the end of 2022-23. Calciomercato report that Napoli have already registered their interest in Buongiorno with the player’s agent, Beppe Riso, but they could make an initial approach to Torino in the coming days. It is believed that Torino are looking for a transfer fee of €40m paid up front.

        "content": "There has been no shortage of emotional outpouring and tributes in the wake of Bill Walton 's passing. One of the most heartfelt and heartbreaking has been, without a doubt, from Dave Pasch. The longtime ESPN announcer, who broadcasted games alongside Walton for over a decade, spoke to the network on Monday about his incredible bond with the late great basketball Hall of Famer. \"He'd take the headset off during a commercial break and just say to me, 'I love you, but don't tell anybody,\" Pasch told SportsCenter. \"I think he enjoyed the fact that I was his sparring partner and that he could have fun with me and just take shots at me and that I knew it was all part of the game.\" \"I love you, but don't tell anybody.\" Bill Walton's longtime broadcast partner @DavePasch reflects on one of his favorite memories of his friend ❤️ pic.twitter.com/zcBDQHlBOp There was no shortage of shenanigans when Pasch called basketball games alongside Walton. High notes from their broadcasts together included Walton bringing Pasch odd gifts, changing his t-shirt mid-broadcast and, quite famously, eating a lit candle on live TV. The No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft and 1993 Hall of Fame inductee started his broadcasting career in 2002 as a pro basketball analyst for ESPN and ABC. Pasch joined ESPN the following year and the duo went on to be a regular fixture calling college basketball games. Walton, a two-time NCAA champion with the UCLA Bruins and two-time NBA champion, passed away following a long battle with cancer. He was 71 years old.",

        "content": "A bike rider in Vadodara was injured and his wife and two children had a narrow escape on Sunday night after a bus rammed a green shade at the Akota Dandia Bazar signal, pulling it down, said police. The Vadodara Traffic Police, which had put up the shades at three junctions, has decided to remove the structures. The bus driver is set to be booked for negligence, officials said on Monday. The green shade – supported by iron pillars — was installed just a day before the incident to provide relief to drivers during the heatwave. The incident occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday when the luggage carrier of the luxury bus was passing the Akota Dandia Bazar flyover and got stuck in the green mat, pulling down the structure. Amid the collapse, Nivritt More (40), a bike rider, was injured while his wife and two children had a narrow escape. More suffered minor injuries on his right leg and was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Jyoti Patel, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vadodara Traffic Police, told The Indian Express that the traffic police had begun the process to identify the driver of the luxury bus to book a case of ‘negligent driving’. “We had erected the shades at three traffic junctions with the intention of providing relief to motorists in wake of the heat wave. The driver of the luxury bus was negligent as he was aware that the height of the shade was lower than the height of the bus he was driving. He should not have attempted to cross the shade and put other motorists at risk. We are identifying the driver and booking a case of negligence,” Patel said. Patel said that the shade was erected on Saturday as the mercury soared in Vadodara; however, the police have decided to remove the shades following Sunday’s incident “We have decided to remove the shades as negligent drivers can cause such mishaps. We are fortunate that we did not have any major accidents at this spot yesterday. Also, the temperatures have dipped and the orange alert for heatwave has been withdrawn so the shades are not needed anymore,” Patel said.",

        "content": "has always been of hip-hop ever since he became a back in the . Over the years, we have seen him take the respective sounds of artists like Ye, , , and more and create a one-of-a-kind psychedelic sound. But even before he began his rap journey, he was looking to get ahead even when he was an actual student. According to , one of many Travis Scott fan accounts recently uncovered a essay from his short stint at university. This four-page paper from December 5, 2009, seems to have been for an English professor of some sort. If you did not know, Trav attended The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). He would drop out during his sophomore year, before ultimately becoming the controversial superstar we know him to be. In the essay, Scott flexes his rap knowledge by summarizing the careers of Kid Cudi and . He refers to them as \"well-known rappers that had similar lifestyles but different messages.\" Subsequently, these parallels \"carried them an opportunity to get sign to a multi-million-dollar company called G.O.O.D. MUSIC.\" Near the end of the paper, Scott wanted to this story to convey that, \"Success is not something that is giving out. You must go out and take what you want.\" Even though the multi-hyphenate must have felt good about his efforts here, fans have been quick to tear it up. \"Dude wrote the intro, then just copy paste Wikipedia!☠️\" one user writes. \"Goddamn my brain is hurting reading this s***\" another adds. While some of the grammar is not totally refined, it seems that he knew this information on the back of his hand. What are your thoughts on this college essay about G.O.O.D. Music by Travis Scott?

        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — The power went out. The sky turned dark. It was late on Saturday night in Valley View, Texas when a tornado hit the town. \"We ran into my sister's closet,\" said Abby Peters. \"My sister ran in her room to grab her baby and all I saw was her being taken away. The house started shaking and she went this way and we were in the closet. And then the house just started to move.\" Abby and her sister, Veronica Bowers, live on their family property with their children. They each had a mobile home on the land. Both were destroyed by the tornado. \"My family, we've owned this property since 1992,\" said Abby. She said this is the first time she's experienced a storm like this. Once the tornado passed through, Veronica was nowhere to be seen. The family started digging and found her underneath the rubble, yards away from where her home originally stood. \"She had that baby in her arms the whole time. She did not let go of her,\" said Abby. She was severely injured but hung on tight to her 10-month-old daughter, Zolabelle. Zolabelle has a small bruise on her head but is otherwise uninjured. Veronica suffered 9 fractured ribs, a punctured lung, and has a small blood clot, according to Abby. She was transported to a hospital in Fort Worth. \"My sister is actually the general manager at the Shell gas station down here off Lone Oak, and whenever the tornado started to happen, she was on the phone with one of her employees, and her employee heard her screaming 'Help me. Save my baby.' And then he told everybody that was in the gas station to take cover,\" said Abby. Abby and Veronica's home is two miles from the gas station . She said the tornado struck them first before crossing the highway to the gas station. Officials estimate around 125 people took shelter inside the store at the gas station. Many people were driving on I-35 when they exited to find a safe place to hide. The tornado hit the building directly. Cars surrounding the building are totaled. Everyone inside the gas station survived, but dozens were injured. Among the destruction on Veronica and Abby's lot, they are still missing two of their family pets. Their dogs were in the home with them, and have not been seen since. Abby and her family have been digging through the debris for their dogs. A fundraiser has been set up for the sisters and their children to recover and rebuild.",

        "content": "Britain’s psychotic flying scumbags are being celebrated in the nation’s first festival of seagulls. Gullfest in Plymouth, Devon, will feature a two-hour procession that will see gull fanatics dress as the winged menaces to perform a song in their honour. Centred around the 37 Looe Street gallery, the festival will also see around 40 performers and artists holding music, spoken word, poetry, painting, and movies events to celebrate gulls as “majestic” human companions. Organiser Mo Bottomley said: “Gullfest is an arts festival celebrating our great Plymouth co-habitant, the majestic seagull. “Whether the svelte lesser black-backed, its larger cousin, the ubiquitous herring gull, the sweet little black-headed gulls, or any of the myriad, sometimes hybrid, species that live alongside us in Plymouth, Gullfest honours them all over a weekend of painting and sculpture, performance and moving image, music and poetry, workshops and ritual.” Ralph Nel and Isaac Lenkiewicz will lead a “ritual songwriting workshop” during the three-day event. It will see participants dressed in the “white, greys, blacks, and reds” of gull feathers. Also at the event will be a ‘Gull Dance’ that will be created after an examination of gulls’ “muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, hearts and blood”. Audiovisual artist Lucy Dafwyn will be hosting a workshop teaching guests how to screech like gulls, which will then be performed as part of a ‘Gull Choir’. And “local pigeon lord” Adam Coley will be taking a ‘Gullaerobics’ lunchtime “wellness break”. It will see him putting guests through “gull positions, gestures and movements” so they can “get as sleekety-sleek as your local herring or black-backed gull”.",

        "content": "Reports from the Central Bank of the Iranian regime indicate that government debts to the banking system have doubled during Ebrahim Raisi’s presidency, and the government’s has worsened. The Central Bank of the Iranian regime recently released annual budget details for the period from 2017 to 2020, showing an annual deficit of 30%. Despite this, the Central Bank has still refrained from reporting on the budget realization status during Raisi’s term. In 2018, then–president Hassan Rouhani had instructed the Central Bank to stop publishing the country’s budget realization reports, citing the need to keep government information confidential due to US sanctions. Pro-government media in the Iranian regime are attempting to highlight the 5% growth in GDP in 2023 as a success for Raisi. However, details from the Statistical Center’s report show that the only reason for the relatively higher GDP growth last year was a 21.8% increase in and a 16.7% increase in government spending. Meanwhile, none of the mentioned GDP growth drivers have had a positive impact on people’s livelihoods and are not sustainable. In March, after a six-month halt, the Central Bank of the Iranian regime published the inflation report for December of the previous year, which indicated that the 2023 broke the 49% record set in 1995. According to the Central Bank, in December 2023, the point-to-point urban inflation rate was 54.2% and the average urban inflation rate was 55.9%. However, in March and April, the Central Bank, in its debt and dowry payment calculation table, announced the annual inflation rate for 2024 to be 52.3%, the highest annual inflation rate in the past 80 years. At the same time, the Statistical Center of Iran, by publishing the point-to-point inflation rate for 2023, announced that among commodities, various types of meat led the price increases with a 50.9% inflation rate. According to published statistics, the inflation rate this year was 32.24%, and the public transportation services sector topped the price increases with 58% inflation. Inflation in Iran has been increasing daily, and a recent report from the Statistical Center at the end of May showed that inflation in the red meat and poultry group was about 74% in the 12 months leading up to May 2024. According to this report, inflation in the housing sector was over 40%. Official reports, including the report from the Parliamentary Research Center, show that the pressure from rising costs on one hand and the lack of proportionate wage increases on the other has caused families to reduce their consumption of food and beverages. According to a report published by the Parliamentary Research Center in April and May 2024, the calorie intake of Iranians in 2022 was below the standard level. According to official data recorded on changes in the rental index, the highest growth record in rental rates in the history of recorded rental data was registered under the 13th government. Rental rates jumped by 44% and 52% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, which is unprecedented in Iran’s economic history since the rental index was recorded. Tejarat News website, in a comparative report, announced: “ ‘s government holds the record for the highest increase in gold coin prices in the first two and a half years of activity among the governments of the past 40 years.” According to this report, in the first 32 months of the 13th government’s activity, the price of gold coins jumped by 291%, the highest increase among the post-1979 revolution governments. In the first two and a half years of Hassan Rouhani’s government, the price of gold coins increased by 11%. The price of the dollar also grew by 160% in the first two and a half years of Raisi’s government, whereas it had increased by 10% in the first 32 months of Rouhani’s government.",

        "description": "Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry and and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service, killed at least 45 people. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior terrorists. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The terrorist group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images” from the strike on Rafah “are heartbreaking.” It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate cease-fire,” he wrote. Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas terrorists, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian terrorists and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The overall Palestinian death toll in the war is now above 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally.",

        "content": "Chinese doctors say they've CURED diabetes in man, 59, using stem cell therapy in a world-first By Connor Boyd Health And Science Editor For Dailymail.Com and Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 21:18, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:56, 27 May 2024 e-mail 6 View comments Researchers in China say they have cured diabetes for the first time. The patient, a 59-year-old man, received a pioneering cell transplant in 2021 and has been medication-free since 2022. The experimental treatment involved creating an artificial version of cells found in the pancreas that produce insulin and keep blood sugar levels in check. The man had suffered from type 2 diabetes for 25 years and had lost almost all function of these cells, known as islets. He was deemed high risk of deadly complications, requiring multiple insulin injections every day to prevent him from going into a diabetic coma. The pancreas is an organ which, amongst other functions, produces insulin. Insulin is a natural hormone that our body uses to control the amount of sugar in our blood stream. People with diabetes have trouble regulating their blood sugar because of pancreatic dysfunction. People with diabetes often use blood sugar monitors, like this one pictured, to determine how much sugar is currently circulating in their blood stream. This helps them decide what to eat and when to use insulin to best manage their disease. Up to this point, no one has ever been 'cured' of diabetes, but doctors have figured out how to put it into remission. But this requires patients to keep up a relatively strict diet and exercise program to stop the blood sugar problems returning. However, the case in China suggests it's possible to restore the body's ability to naturally regulate blood-sugar without a patient changing their lifestyle. The treatment used stem cells, which are a blank-slate kind of cell that can be turned into the many different types of cells the body needs to function. Under the right conditions, stem cells can turn into brain, muscle, kidney or even pancreas tissue. This treatment used a new chemical cocktail to turn the patient's stem cells into pancreas cells. These cells produce insulin, which tells your body when to pull sugar from the food we eat for energy. In diabetics, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar. Too much or too little sugar in the blood can cause nerve damage, kidney damage, heart disease and more. Read More Revolutionary treatment for type 1 diabetes could see cells that act like the pancreas transplanted into patients' arms By implanting the new, lab-grown cells, which can produce insulin, the patient could begin producing their own insulin again, researchers suggest. This is what doctors have observed in the Chinese patient. 'I think this study represents an important advance in the field of cell therapy for diabetes,' Timothy Kieffer, a professor of cellular and physiological sciences at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved with the research, told South China Morning Post . Though this finding is encouraging, there's still a ways to go before it can be approved for the masses. Next, scientists will have to test their therapy in more patients. After they test it in more people, Professor Kieffer said, they'll need to find a way to scale up their operation. Currently, turning blank 'seed cells' into functioning pancreas cells is incredibly intricate, time-consuming and expensive. Scientists will have to make the process easier if it's going to be feasible for most people. There is a chance it might only work to treat type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease. Type 1 diabetics, whose pancreas has been attacked by the immune system, might have a harder time using this treatment because their immune system might reject the new implanted cells, the study authors wrote. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement Regardless of all the hurdles still left to cross, this could be a huge step forward for the 38.4 million Americans currently living with diabetes and the 97.6 million who will likely go on to develop the disease. It's the eighth leading cause of death in the country. This paper, which was published in the journal Cell Discovery is the result of decades of research, across many countries, into how best to turn stem cells into islet cells, and how to get those islet cells into the body. 'Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes,' Dr Yin Hao, one of the lead researchers said. The study was a collaboration between three institutions based in Shanghai -the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Renji Hospital. In the future, Professor Kieffer said this therapy may, 'free patients from the burden of chronic medications, improve health and quality of life, and reduce healthcare expenditures.'

That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guinea’s disaster agency. “The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,” National Disaster Centre Acting Director Lusete Laso Mana said in a letter to the UN. “The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both rescue teams and survivors alike,” he added, saying the main highway to the area had been completely blocked by the landslide. “Following the inspection conducted by the team, it was determined that the damages are extensive and require immediate and collaborative actions from all players.”",

        "content": "After making significant strides in his second NFL season, Giants edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux has his sights set on taking yet another leap in 2024. Thibodeaux, the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, flashed upside as a rookie but only racked up 49 tackles, including six for a loss, and four sacks. Although he started and ended 2023 sluggishly, Thibodeaux finished the year with 11.5 sacks, the 12th-most in the NFL. Now back in East Rutherford for his third year of organized team activities, Thibodeaux recently told reporters he's doing \"everything\" he can to \"take that next step\" toward greatness. “Last year I was able to get 11 and a half sacks,” Thibodeaux said , via Pro Football Talk's Josh Alper. “Those are the accolades. Now it’s about getting that respect throughout the league, having teams fear coming to play against us. Just taking everything I do to the next level as far as that extra. Greatness is optional. I just got to kind of take that next step.” Prior to Thursday's OTAs session, Thibodeaux also made it clear that \"every year\" he's with the Giants, he's gunning for his mentor and Giants legend Michael Strahan's single-season sack record of 22.5. While no player has yet to top Strahan's impressive feat, it's worth noting that Steelers LB T.J. Watt tied the record during the 2021 season. Despite his confidence and last season's increased production, Thibodeaux has a long way to go before he can be considered one of the NFL's top edge-rushers and have a chance to break the single-season sack record. As mentioned, Thibodeaux struggled to maintain consistency last season. Not only did he go his first two games of the season without a sack, but he also failed to collect one across his final four games. During those six games, Thibodeaux made just five solo tackles, three of which came in New York's 27-10 Week 18 win over Philadelphia. Additionally, Thibodeaux's underlying metrics from last season show that he wasn't nearly as dominant as his sack total suggests. According to Pro Football Focus , Thibodeaux posted a 6.4 pass-rush win rate in 2023, ranking 101st among all qualified edge-rushers. The total was also substantially lower than the 9.7 pass-rush win rate he posted as a rookie, which would've still only ranked 77th among edges this past season. Nonetheless, considering the Giants are implementing a different scheme under new DC Shane Bowen and the team added two-time Pro Bowl edge-rusher Brian Burns earlier this offseason, Thibodeaux is well-positioned to continue his ascent.",

        "description": "The Indianapolis Colts could be scary in 2024, at least second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson believes so.",
        "content": "At least one member of the believes the team's offense is ready to cook in 2024. Michael Pittman Jr., who with the team this offseason, : I think we could have the best RPO [run-pass option] game in the whole NFL. We went to the RPO a lot last year, and just being able to add Anthony's legs, I mean, he can add in a whole other aspect which is you can't really load up that box. He can pull it and throw it. You can't really [concentrate] most of the defense towards J.T. There are reasons for Pittman's optimism. Two of those reasons are quarterback and running back Jonathan Taylor. Both are healthy after injuries affected them in 2023. In fact, the two barely played together in 2023. As ESPN notes, Richardson got hurt as Taylor returned from injury, and the pair hardly spent any time together on the field. Key Players Return for the Colts Taylor started 2023 late due to an ankle injury and a contract dispute, while Richardson was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Jonathan Taylor 2023 Stats Games Played 10 Rushing Attempts 169 Rushing Yards 741 Rushing Touchdowns 7 Receptions 19 Receiving Yards 153 Receiving Touchdowns 1 Fumbles 1 Pittman Jr. himself is still developing into a key weapon, and other young Colts such as Josh Downs and Alec Pierce have more experience under their belts now. The Colts also will get tight end Jelani Woods back as he will be recovering from injury, and the team added wide receiver Adonai Mitchell via the . That gives Indianapolis an offense full of young, talented skill players. Head coach that things are looking up for the Colts: It's fun and it's exciting. Every week, we'll have things [in the game plan] for every single guy. As far as the scheme goes, it's exciting to have a whole bunch of guys that you can do a whole bunch of different things with. According to ESPN, Steichen has spent a lot of time in his office, working on the best ways to utilize this offense against opponents by creating the best possible matchups. The coach loves to use multiple personnel groupings, and the versatility offered by this group of skill-position players gives him a lot of options. He's also open to feedback from his players. We just toss ideas around. He asks me how I feel about certain things, and, then if I see certain things on the internet, like if I see a sweep or an option play or something like that, I'll say 'Hey, that's kind of nice.' I'll show it to him and he'll be like, 'OK, we might be able to throw that in.' It's amazing to have a coach like that because we get to use our offense and use our weapons. Even with backups Gardner Minshew and Zack Moss playing, the Colts managed to be 10th in the NFL with 23.3 points per game. The Colts also managed 336.8 yards per game. to get back on the horse and lead this young team to great things in 2024: \"We've got young athletes, people who can run... It's going to be a crazy year. Perhaps just crazy enough that the Colts, who missed the playoffs due to a loss in the regular-season finale, will be in the postseason at the end of the year. Anthony Richardson's injury-plagued first four games were still historic: his 136 rushing yards were 9th-most for a QB in his first four career games, and his four rushing TDs were tied for 1st with Cam Newton and RG3.

Launched three years ago, the Academy is a restaurant unlike any other. It features an immersive learning experience that has been created for students completing their (Bachelor honours) International Hospitality Management or Culinary Art Management degrees at Ulster University . Academy incorporates a state-of-the-art city centre restaurant, culinary and beverage school. It works as an educational hub while also making a contribution to the local hospitality sector, and is one of only five training restaurant facilities in the UK. READ MORE: We tried Ulster University's training restaurant in Belfast city centre READ MORE: Plans unveiled for new 850-bedroom student accommodation in Belfast city centre The restaurant gives students hands-on experience working within the hospitality industry in Northern Ireland , as well as providing practical support to entrepreneurs. One of those students is Lisa Quinn, 19, from Co Armagh, who is in her first year studying Culinary Arts Management at UU during the week and working at Killeavy Castle Estate over the weekend. She told Belfast Live : \"After working as a waitress for a long time and being in the kitchens, it seemed like a really fun environment and I had family members in the cookery line of work too so I thought why not give it a go! \"The Academy Restaurant is a learning environment, first and foremost, but it's also open to the public so you can get really good quality service and food brought to you by people learning for their future profession. \"It's great food in a great environment especially as we do offer daily lunch services and on Tuesdays and Thursdays there's a tasting menu by the students so there's always something different happening.\" Lisa Quinn, who is in her first year studying Culinary Arts Management at Ulster University (Image: Belfast Live) Lisa has just returned from the first Regenerative Hospitality Summit, co-hosted by UU in Transylvania, Romania, which shone a spotlight on how regenerative practices within the industry can continue to enhance Northern Ireland’s reputation as a leading food and drink destination. Expert contributors from different locations around the world, including Chef Skye Gyngell, of Heckfield Place in Hampshire, led conversations about the need for hospitality to promote behavioural change, with respect to the climate crisis and cross-cultural understanding. Hospitality and culinary arts management students from Ulster University like Lisa played a central role in proceedings by cooking alongside TV chef and author Romy Gill MBE and Oxford Cultural Collective Patron, chef Paul Bloomfield for the delegation throughout the three days. The Regenerative Hospitality Summit also included a dedicated session focused on food, drink and hospitality in Northern Ireland – its prospects for the future and how it might give the region competitive advantage on the basis of its contribution to communities and the natural environment. \"My biggest takeaway from the event was that you just need to keep calm in the kitchen and not everything is always going to go right so you have to keep your cool and everything will work out. Also the facilities around you aren't always going to be what you need them to be so you just have to work with what you've got,\" Lisa added. \"Getting to work with Paul Bloomfield was really helpful and he was always completely ready to explain anything to a first year student who doesn't know everything - always happy to teach which was brilliant.\" Lisa speaking to Belfast Live in Academy Restaurant in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter (Image: Belfast Live) And for anyone considering a career in the industry, Lisa has this message: \"In my first year I've been learning all the basic skills and obviously got the great opportunity to go to Romania. \"In second year you get to do a tasting menu course on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which I'm really excited about as it lets you take complete control and create your own menu so you're essentially the head chef in the kitchen for the night, which is a great experience. \"You go off on your placement in third year which again will be really exciting and fourth year is focused on managing the business side of things. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody considering this career as it's a great experience with great opportunities.\" Video by Belfast Live videographer Harry Bateman.

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a...",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a...",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole.

Although Goldberg never wrestled Eddie Guerrero, the WWE Hall of Famer did wrestle Chavo. (per Fightful ) “That Guerrero family had such a huge impact on me when I was coming up. They would take the time, unlike others, who felt threatened, they would take the time to make sure I knew the basics. Whether it was Eddie or Chavo. Chavo was great with me. The entire family, I have nothing but found memories with all of our interactions. In this day and age, a lot of people have ulterior motives. That family never had an ulterior motive, just an effort to make you better than you were before. That, you have to take your hat off to and cover your heart for, and you have to be appreciative that you run into people with such good character.”",

Born in 1944, millionaire businessman Goad is reported to have once boasted of beating his own “record\" of abusing 142 boys in one year. Victims later revealed that as part of his sick crimes, he threatened some boys into procuring other boys for him to abuse. From , the sick paedophile founded Cornish Market World in Par in 1991, which became at one point Britain's biggest indoor market with more than 300 stalls. He later launched Ben's Playworld, a children's play zone neighbouring the market - both of which are still open to this day under new names and ownership. The adventure park, near , was extremely popular from the moment of its opening in the 1990s, playing host to children's parties aimed at 2 to 12 year-olds. Its features included mega-slides, giant tubes, a massive ball-pool and later a pirate adventure attraction. Goad, after decades of abusing boys as young as eight years old, was jailed for life in 2004 after he pleaded guilty to 14 counts of serious sexual assault – now categorised as rape following changes in the law – and two charges of indecent assault. Detectives said Goad would prey on vulnerable young boys and use various techniques to 'groom' them before sexually abusing and raping them. He would even invite them to his home or offer them well-paid jobs in one of his shops. Victims were often threatened with 'being sorted' with violence if they ever spoke of what had happened. Goad, 60, when he was convicted cheered as he was jailed. After conviction, staff said he used to spend a lot of time at Ben's Playworld. During the 1970s Goad worked at the dockyard. He later set up his own shops throughout the South West, including two branches of Discounts in Plymouth. Some of his victims later claimed Goad sexually abused them at his stores in Plymouth. At least two of Goad's victims later committed suicide while others battled drug abuse and mental illness or turned to crime. Judge William Taylor, who jailed Goad for life following a trial at Plymouth Crown Court, described him as a \"dangerous paedophile\" and fixed a determined sentence of six years and two months. He said Goad would \"not be released until the authorities are satisfied you pose no risk to anyone, particularly children\", but added: “It may well mean in your case that life may mean just that.\" The court described him as a “voracious, calculating, predatory and violent homosexual paedophile”. The earliest abuse case city police unearthed dates back to 1964 when Goad was just 19 years old. Goad fled to Thailand in 1998 on a false passport, aware that police were on his tail following new allegations. He was arrested in June 2003 after returning to the UK on a false passport. Goad was turned down for parole in 2010, having never admitted his guilt. He died of natural causes on October 20, 2012, at HMP Isle of Wight, Albany. He was aged 68 at the time of his death. Victim Paul Wyatt, who later waived his right to anonymity, said that Goad, who abused him for four years from the age of 12, was part of a \"bigger network of paedophiles\" which included people in positions of \"power and trust\". \"There are people who have sold their soul to the devil, without a doubt,\" he said.",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM - Midfielder Marten de Roon has been ruled out of the European Championship after being injured playing for Atalanta in the Italian Cup final, the Dutch football association said in statement on Monday. The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. REUTERS",

However, things took a sharp turn when, according to social media posts from attendees, the Oscar-winning actor began sharing offensive comments about women and trans youth. According to one attendee , Dreyfuss called Barbra Streisand a “genius” but said he “didn’t listen to her because she is a woman and women shouldn’t have that power.” The same attendee said Dreyfuss—who was clad in a housedress and waving a cane, according to Deadline —then claimed that “you shouldn’t be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.” More attendees shared on the theater’s Facebook page that they walked out of the event because of Dreyfuss’ inflammatory remarks. One person wrote, “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred[s] of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic [sic] rant.” Another attendee posted: “richard dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice.” The Daily Beast has reached out to Dreyfuss’ representative for comment. This isn’t the first time Dreyfuss’ views have landed him in hot water. Last year, during an interview on PBS’s Firing Line , the actor blasted the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences’ new diversity and inclusion rules while defending actors using blackface. “They make me vomit,” he said of the academy’s rules. “Because this is an art form. It’s also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it’s an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.”",

        "content": "EAMONN Holmes is facing fresh heartbreak following his split from Ruth Langsford — the loss of custody of their beloved dog Maggie. The pooch, 14, which the former This Morning presenters adopted in 2011, is said to be like a “second child” to them, even appearing with the pair on the ITV show. Ruth shared a video of herself walking Collie cross Maggie on Sunday — her first post since the couple told The Sun their 14-year marriage was over. They said they had been living separate lives for two years and Eamonn, who has faced health struggles of late, had recently moved out. Pals said he and Ruth are now having “difficult conversations” over who gets the dog. The pair, both 64, are trying to avoid calling in lawyers like Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong did when they rowed about their mutt Hurley. A source said: “Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she’s getting on and they know she needs stability. \"It’s a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie’s been such a support during his health woes . \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. “But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split . “They are adamant this won’t come to what Ant and Lisa went through and they won’t be getting lawyers involved.” Eamonn, who has a son, Jack, 22, with Ruth, spoke earlier this year of Maggie’s “unconditional love” and the joy she brings to his life. He said: “I genuinely have never experienced affection like it.” Friends said he and Ruth drifted apart when they were taken off This Morning in 2021. Insiders said Ruth wanted a fresh start while admitting Eamonn believed they could salvage something. Ruth will not appear on Loose Women this week following the news of their divorce. Eamonn is expected to return to GB News’ Breakfast Show today. Pals do not know if he will address their split on air. Before the shock split announcement, Ruth and Eamonn seemed like one of the strongest couples on UK TV – even with their signature bickering style. Here's how their romance played out 1997 - The couple first meet after being introduced by mutual friends, two years after Eamonn splits from his first wife, Gabrielle, with whom he has three children. 1997-2002 - To be respectful to Gabrielle, the couple kept their relationship out of the limelight. Ruth told Daily Mail : \"I thought it spoke volumes about the sort of man he was, the sort of father he was and the integrity he had. It made me love him more, not less.\" 2002 - Ruth and Eamonn welcome their son, Jack, to the family 2005 - Eamonn finalises his divorce with Gabrielle 2006 - The pair begin to host Friday episodes of This Morning together 2010 - Eamonn proposes to Ruth while at the Cheltenham Races, after asking Ruth's mother for her hand June 2010 - Eamonn and Ruth marry at Elvetham Hall, Hampshire 2016 - Eamonn undergoes a double hip replacement in the first of many health battles. June 2019 - On This Morning, Ruth and Eamonn say the secret to their happy marriage. Eamonn credits \"compromise, consideration and lots of conjugals,\" while Ruth said it was \"laughter and an equal marriage\" November 2020 - Ruth and Eamonn are replaced on their regular Friday slot by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary in a 'show shake-up' December 202 1 - After a year of being moved to the bank holiday presenting slot, both Eamonn and Ruth left This Morning January 2022 - Eamonn makes his debut on GB News, while Ruth stayed with ITV in her long-standing role on Loose Women. September 2022 - Eamonn undergoes spinal surgery after years of back issues including a trapped sciatic nerve. November 2022 - Eamonn falls down the stairs of his Surrey home with Ruth and breaks his shoulder, requiring a new operation September 2023 - Eamonn has a spine and neck stretching procedure as part of his year-long recovery May 2024 - Ruth and Eamonn announce they have split after 14 years of marriage and 27 year relationship",

They said they had been living separate lives for two years and Eamonn , who has faced health struggles of late, had recently moved out. Pals said he and Ruth are now having “difficult conversations” over who gets the dog. The pair, both 64, are trying to avoid calling in lawyers like Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong did when they rowed about their mutt Hurley. A source said: “Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she’s getting on and they know she needs stability. \"It’s a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie’s been such a support during his health woes . \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. “But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split . “They are adamant this won’t come to what Ant and Lisa went through and they won’t be getting lawyers involved.” Eamonn, who has a son, Jack, 22, with Ruth, spoke earlier this year of Maggie’s “unconditional love” and the joy she brings to his life. He said: “I genuinely have never experienced affection like it.” Friends said he and Ruth drifted apart when they were taken off This Morning in 2021. Insiders said Ruth wanted a fresh start while admitting Eamonn believed they could salvage something. Ruth will not appear on Loose Women this week following the news of their divorce .

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "description": "The Labour politician has represented the constituency for 23 years",
        "content": "Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan has announced he will stand down ahead of the general election. In a personal statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter , Mr Brennan said \"a seed of doubt\" as to whether to continue was \"sown\" after surgery for prostate cancer. Sharing the news on Monday evening, he said: \"I’m announcing my decision to stand down as Cardiff West MP after 23 years - thank you to local Labour members and constituents for your friendship and support.\" In the statement he explained how he intended to stand for his seventh term, but decided not to due to the intensity of the role. He said it is \"the right moment\" for him to stand down. For the latest analysis of the biggest stories, sign up to the Wales Matters newsletter here READ MORE: UK drivers face new law in July with mandatory speed limiters on all new cars READ MORE: The people in the running to replace Huw Edwards for the BBC's general election coverage The statement read: \"It has been the privilege of my life to represent the Cardiff West constituency as its Labour MP for the past 23 years. Following the sudden announcement on Wednesday, it was still my intention to stand again for a seventh term, but after discussing it with my family over the bank holiday weekend I have concluded that this is the right election for me to step down. \"The job of a Member of Parliament is immensely rewarding but highly demanding for the individual and their loved ones. I have always enjoyed its intensity and challenge, but after surgery for prostate cancer a small seed of doubt was sown as to whether I should continue in such a full-on role. \"Standing again would mean making a commitment to perform the demanding duties of an MP close to my 70th birthday. This has led me to conclude that this is the right moment to stand down.\" Mr Brennan underwent prostate cancer surgery in 2022. Mr Brennan said he had had a PSA test, a blood test which is used to help detect prostate cancer. The test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Speaking at the time he said: \"I am a fit and healthy man who had zero symptoms before diagnosis - over 50s ask your GP for a PSA test and get a scan if indicated as I did - early diagnosis means you can monitor changes and intervene only if necessary.\" Mr Brennan entered the Commons in 2001 and previously served as a Labour minister, as well as on the shadow front bench. He is a member of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.",

        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster.

But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday, first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them.

        "content": "The Connecticut Sun are off to their third 5-0 start in franchise history, and their past four wins were decided by a combined 16 points. Coming off another close win, the Sun attempt to start a season with six straight wins for the first time Tuesday night when they host the Phoenix Mercury in Uncasville, Conn. The Sun are off to the same five-win start as the 2021 and 2018 seasons. After opening with a 21-point rout of Indiana, Connecticut earned a seven-point victory over Washington, a four-point win at Indiana and a one-point overtime home win over Minnesota. Connecticut kept the unbeaten start going on Saturday when it earned an 86-82 win at Chicago thanks to DeWanna Bonner, who leads the team in scoring at 20.6 points. Bonner scored eight of her 19 points in the fourth quarter. Bonner scored five straight points to spark a 7-0 run that turned a one-point Sun deficit into a 85-79 lead with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining in regulation. Bonner started by missing her first five 3-point attempts, and her big fourth quarter helped the Sun overcome Alyssa Thomas getting ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant foul against Chicago rookie Angel Reese. \"Certainly you don't want to have your MVP off the floor. She was on her way to a triple-double,\" Sun coach Stephanie White said of Thomas, who had nine points, six assists and six rebounds before the ejection. \"But everybody stepped up, and for us to be successful, that's what it's going to take.\" After winning three straight and holding their first four opponents to 42.3 percent shooting or lower, the Mercury (3-2) were handed a 107-92 loss to the Dallas Wings on Saturday. Phoenix allowed 52 percent shooting and a 40-point game to Arike Ogunbowale while struggling in the paint and on the glass. The Mercury experienced their worst struggles on the inside while Britney Griner continued to recover from a fractured toe. They were outrebounded 38-25 and outscored 52-26 in the paint. \"This is one of those games where we got dominated inside,\" Phoenix coach Nate Tibbetts said. \"Give them credit, that's their strength. They took full advantage tonight.\" Kahleah Copper led the Mercury with 32 points for her third 30-point game of the season; she now leads the league with 29.2 points per game. Diana Taurasi added 28 but Phoenix struggled to overcome a 17-point halftime deficit. This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Residents and developers will be able to remove trees within three metres of dwellings or pools more easily under changes proposed by Sutherland Shire Council. or signup to continue reading At present, development applications (DAs) are subject to a merit assessment against specified criteria, including public safety, bush fire risk, personal hardship, Greenweb, and scenic and visual quality. The council voted 8-6 at last week's council meeting to amend the Development Control Plan (DCP) to state, \"Council will permit removal of a tree located within three metres of an existing or proposed dwelling or swimming pool as part of council's assessment\". \"An application must still be submitted to council and approved before a tree which is located within three metres of an existing or proposed building or swimming pool or can be removed,\" the DCP will state. \"In bushfire prone zones RFS regulations apply (10 metres).\" The rewording will include the \"objective\" to \"recognise that some residents do not feel comfortable when large trees are located close to their residence\". The fee for replacement trees, required as part of approvals, will increase from $125 to a \"realistic\" $400. The council is required to conduct community engagement before the change is locked in. A report by council staff recommended the statu quo, stating that an \"as-of-right approach\" was less likely to maintain the current tree canopy percentages, and even more unlikely to deliver on NSW Government targets. Mayor Carmelo Pesce, who moved to amend the DCP, said the new wording was actually introduced in 2012 at the instigation of Liberal councillors, and remained until the 2015 LEP and DCP came into effect. The provision had been \"removed without our consent\" by council staff, he said. Cr Pesce said he only found out when, \"on three occasions, he was approached by residents after council staff refused a DA because a tree was in the way\". Cr Pesce said his priority was making sure people felt safe in their homes, not the tree canopy. \"That's what our responsibility is - not worrying about the canopy, because our community comes first,\" he said. Cr Pesce said there had been many incidents of trees falling unexpectedly and endangering lives. Labor councillor Jack Boyd opposed the change, saying it \"opened too many doors\" for trees to be removed. Cr Boyd said someone could lodge a DA, but go through with it, \"and then, 'look, amazing, the yard's just lost a big gum tree' \". \"We have enough problems with our tree and bushland policy and the loss of tree canopy, I think we can go to the minimal effort of having a merit assessment for an application that already has to be lodged,\" he said. \"I don't understand why we would open Pandora's Box for all the maybes. \"Let's not get wrapped up in the history of what's occurred in the past, let's look at it on its merits now. Fellow Labor councillor Diedree Steinwall said much had changed since 2012. \"We are losing 5000-6000 canopy trees a year and we can't afford to have something that would probably lend itself to more trees,\" she said. \"We are not meeting our own canopy targets or state government targets.\" St George and Sutherland Shire Leader reporter covering politics, urban affairs, council, development and general community news.Email: mtrembath@theleader.com.au St George and Sutherland Shire Leader reporter covering politics, urban affairs, council, development and general community news.Email: mtrembath@theleader.com.au",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal’s record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising defeat against Alexander Zverev before he revealed his journey to the Paris Olympics in July will not take a detour to Wimbledon. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the first round to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport. “I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you,” he said. “If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.” He added: “It’s hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. That is something I don’t feel yet.” Nadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July. Nadal, an Olympic singles gold medallist in Beijing in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: “That’s my main goal now. I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.” He won’t make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners. Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury. In his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010. “It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Zverev said it had been “a great honour” to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment,” said the German star. In a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent. However, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal’s 34. Chants of “Rafa, Rafa” had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule. They subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Nadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn’t back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set. However, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention. The effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Figma is a potent design tool that has swiftly risen to the top of the UI/UX design field. Figma is a useful tool for designers of all experience levels to have in their toolbox. We’ll go over some essential stages in this blog post to assist you in learning Figma as a novice. Learn How to Use the Interface of Figma Getting acquainted with Figma’s interface is the first step towards learning it. Although Figma’s UI is simple to use and straightforward, it may take some getting accustomed to. Take some time to explore the various menus and panels, and see how they interact with one another. To gain a better understanding of how Figma functions , you may also have a peek at some of the pre-made designs and templates. Acquire Knowledge of the Fundamental Tools After you’ve become comfortable with the interface, it’s time to master the fundamental tools. Although Figma has a large toolkit, all you need to know to get started are a few fundamental ones. These consist of the text tool, pen tool, shape tool, and selection tool. Take some time to experiment and become familiar with these tools. Practice Creating Simple Layouts The following action is to practice creating simple layouts. Start with something basic, such as a login screen or landing page. When creating the layout, use the fundamental skills you’ve learned and pay attention to small elements like typography, spacing, and alignment. You can start by using one of the many templates available in Figma, but it’s also a good idea to try creating something from scratch. Play Around with Prototyping Design processes must include prototyping, and Figma makes it simple to produce interactive prototypes. Try out various animations and interactions while you create prototypes for your projects. Don’t be scared to try new things—Figma’s prototyping tools are user-friendly and straightforward to use. Participate in the Figma Community Getting involved in the Figma community is one of the greatest ways to learn Figma . Numerous online tools, guides, and discussion boards are available for you to interact with other designers and gain knowledge from their experiences. You can get access to templates, design materials, and other resources that will help you further your career by becoming a member of the Figma community. Figma’s ability to facilitate real-time collaboration on a single file is another significant benefit. If designers wish to share their work created with traditional “offline” tools such as Sketch and Illustrator, they usually have to export it to an image file and then transmit it by email or instant messaging. Rather than exporting still photographs from Figma, we can just send clients and colleagues a link to the Figma file, which they can examine in their web browsers. This alone can expedite a designer’s process and save a significant amount of time. More significantly, though, it allows clients and coworkers to engage with the work more deeply and examine the most recent version of the file. Create An Account on Figma. It’s easy to get started with Figma. Just visit www.figma.com, select “Get started,” fill out your information, and finish a short verification task. After you complete that, Figma will lead you to a screen containing a few additional onboarding questions before launching a project file that has some samples of what you can produce using the tool. Continue Learning and Practicing Figma Ultimately, continuing to study and practice is the key to becoming an expert in Figma. Figma is always changing, with new tools and features being released on a regular basis. Remain current with the most recent advancements and continue honing your design abilities. To sum up, if you’re just starting out with Figma, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the interface, understand the fundamental tools, practice creating simple layouts, try out prototyping, connect with the Figma community, and never stop learning and improving. These steps will help you quickly become proficient with Figma. Explore the Figma User Interface The Figma interface has a simple appearance and feel, yet it conceals a number of useful capabilities. The major sections of the interface (identified above) are explained as follows. Launch a Fresh Design File Now that you’re familiar with the layout, let’s get started creating! To begin a new project, click the Menu button (the Figma logo) in the upper left corner, choose File, and then choose “New design file.” When you do this, your browser should automatically open a new tab and generate a new file with an empty canvas. Conclusion We hope this overview aids in helping you select the ideal Figma design system , as we have an endless supply of inventive kits and systems at our disposal. After all, each designer has distinct skills and is at a different stage of their journey! UI Figma Design System and online Figma courses are always ready for you if you want to advance your abilities a bit further. The sheer number of distinctive kits and design systems available attests to the greatness of Figma and its user base. What’s not to love about this passionate worldwide community that collaborates to produce tools that make design better for everyone?

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo added yet another record to his collection as he set a new high for goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season. The 39-year-old struck twice in Al-Nassr’s 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park to take his total to 35, eclipsing Abderrazak Hamdallah’s 34 from 2018-19. Hamdallah, who was also playing for Al-Nassr at the time, could at least take some comfort from the fact that his haul came in just 27 league games, four fewer than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star’s. Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil’s long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club’s final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb’s penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer’s strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho ultimately saw the hosts prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

The mechanic enables users to enhance affixes attached to Legendary and Unique items up to 12 times. After leveling through all 12 ranks, an item should receive a 45 percent increase across its base affixes. While the feature proved a welcome addition, the Diablo community quickly uncovered a few flaws. For one, the . Blizzard rolled out a hotfix that reduced the cost, but the system still required some more fine-tuning. Diablo 4’s 1.4.1 to reduce cost of Masterworking As outlined in the patch notes, Diablo 4’s May 28 patch will address lingering Masterworking issues and much more. After the patch, players can expect Masterworking materials to be directly transmuted, for example. The Gold cost of Masterworking will also be decreased for Ranks 5 through 12. A host of bug fixes will additionally launch alongside the update, many of them tackling UI and User Experience troubles.

The New Brunswick Coroner Service issued a statement today saying deputy chief coroner Michael Johnston and a jury will hear evidence from witnesses to determine the facts surrounding Darrell Richards’ death. The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Richards died in hospital on July 1, 2022. The jury will make recommendations aimed at preventing deaths under similar circumstances, but they can’t make any finding of legal responsibility. In February, a provincial court judge ordered American Iron and Metal to pay $107,000 into a workplace-safety bursary in Richards’ name after the scrap recycler pleaded guilty under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to ensure an employee’s safety.

        "content": "Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s government of Kano State has suspended Mustapha Indabawa, the Managing Director (MD) of Abubakar Rimi Television. The government has since appointed Hajiya Hauwa Ibrahim as the acting Managing Director of the television station. Naija News understands that the official letter of appointment for Ibrahim, dated 27 May 2024, was signed by Abdullahi Baffa Bichi, the secretary to the state government. The letter instructs Ibrahim to assume her new role immediately. Prior to this appointment, Ibrahim served as the deputy managing director of the television station. It is worth noting that the Kano State Government has filed seven charges, including criminal conspiracy, misappropriation, and diversion of funds, against the suspended MD and Staff Officer, Ibrahim M. Bello. These charges were brought forth following an investigation by the state anti-corruption commission, which was initiated after a petition was submitted to the state governor regarding the embattled MD. Reinstatement Of Emir Sanusi Done In Best Interest Of The State – Kano Govt Meanwhile, the Kano State Government, on Monday, said the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano was done in the best interest of the state. Recall that Governor Abba Yusuf recently deposed the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero and four emirs amd reinstated Muhammadu Sanusi 11 as the new Emir of a re-united single Kano Emirate. In a statement on Monday, the Commissioner of Information, Baba Halilu Dantiye, said the decision to reinstate Sanusi as the Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. Dantiye added that the reinstatement has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace, who understand and cherish the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure. He said: “It also behoves to reiterate that the decision by the administration of Abba Kabir Yusuf to legally abrogate the emirates and reinstate the 14th Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. The move has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace who understands and cherishes the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure.” Dantiye also urged the general public to disregard the sensational and grossly exaggerated media reports and support the efforts of the government to create a more cohesive and unified state. He also called on the media to exercise responsible journalism and verify facts before publishing any report that has the potential to cause unnecessary tension. “Kano State government under the leadership of Abba Kabir Yusuf remains committed to the progress and development of the state and call on all citizens to join hands in this regard,” he added.",

        "content": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn’t played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu’s result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal’s Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China’s Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches. Shapovalov will next play 25th-seeded Frances Tiafoe of the United States. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "description": "Fewer than 40 North Pacific Right Whale still survive. On Friday, Bay Area scientists saw one of them.",
        "content": "In an extraordinary sighting, a critically endangered right whale was spotted off the Marin County coast on Friday, thrilling scientists. One of the rarest whales in the world, fewer than 40 animals are thought to survive. “It was astonishing,” said research ecologist Jan Roletto, who sighted the whale about three miles west of Point Reyes National Seashore while aboard a research vessel for the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies. Friday’s weather was rough, with fierce winds that pushed 12 to 14-foot swells. The mission of the research team’s weeklong trip was to survey wildlife in a partnership between Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries and Point Blue Conservation Science. But the whale was unmistakable. “It came up right in front of us,” then lingered for nearly 20 minutes, said Roletto, research coordinator for the Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries. Standing together on the ship’s viewing platform, Roletto and marine ecologist Kirsten Lindquist instantly turned to look at each other. “We both knew immediately what it was,” Roletto said. The identification has since been officially confirmed by the NOAA Marine Mammal Lab in Seattle, based on photos and video. The whale had a distinctive V-shaped blow. Wide and pitch black, it had no dorsal fin. And there was at least one cluster of telltale “callosities” on the head, rough and white skin patches. “It seemed to be resting,” Roletto said. “It wasn’t feeding. It wasn’t traveling. It would move a little bit, then sink down.” Like other whales, the species was driven nearly to extinction by commercial whaling. But unlike other whales — such as humpbacks, grey whales and blue whales — it has been much slower to recover. Populations of right whales are larger in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as in the Southern Hemisphere. North Pacific right whales were favored by hunters because they swim slowly near shore, and float after death. By the late 1800s, as many as 40,000 North Pacific right whales had been slaughtered. The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling banned the commercial hunting of right whales in the North Pacific in 1937, and their numbers began to climb. However, illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea again pushed the species toward extinction. They have been protected under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. While whaling is no longer a threat, human activity such as entanglement in fishing gear and marine debris, vessel strikes, impacts from climate change, oil and gas development and ocean noise continue to threaten the species. North Pacific right whales are baleen whales, which feed by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their comb-like baleen plates that trap copepods and other zooplankton. Because they are so rare, very little is known about the movements, migration, breeding or calving of the North Pacific species, said Jim Scarff, an independent whale researcher in Berkeley. Tagging is difficult and unsuccessful, he added. “There is remarkably little understanding about their distribution,” he said. Surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service have detected small numbers of North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska in a small area called the Barnabas Trough, according to the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. Twelve were detected in the southeastern Bering Sea. In the past decade, there have been a handful of detections off the coast of British Columbia or Washington State. In March 2023, hale watchers sighted one close to shore near Pt. Pinos in Monterey Bay. In April 2022, a fisherman reported a sighting near San Mateo County’s Point Ano Nuevo. “It’s always one individual animal, often in the spring,” said Scarff. “And then it’s never seen again.”",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 AMSTERDAM : Midfielder Marten de Roon has been ruled out of the European Championship after being injured playing for Atalanta in the Italian Cup final, the Dutch football association said in statement on Monday. The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. (Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "The smell of fire hangs heavy in the air after rockets hit a holiday let surrounded by cherry trees in Metula just one day earlier. The bedroom burned to a crisp leaving what had been the king-size bed a twisted shamble. \"Here try a cherry,\" Metula mayor David Azulay says as he reaches up to pick the ripe fruit off the tree. \"You in the center of the country have no idea how wonderful it tastes.\" He came to inspect the damage right after the rocket strike and called the owners to brief them on the situation. \"This is a sad part of my job, calling my residents who were evacuated, to tell them about the damage to their property,\" he says. \"The owner told me she had kept a key on the windowsill but there is no longer a window there.\" 4 Holiday let destroyed in Hezbollah attack Photo: Efi Sharir He says sometimes they are just thankful that no one was hurt and sometimes they cry. It's hard to hear them cry after everything they owned was destroyed. Azulay had had to make many such calls since the war began in October. More than 150 anti-tank missiles were fired from Lebanon at the small border town, not to mention the rockets and mortar shells. Approximately 35% of the homes there have been damaged to some extent or other. Many are damaged beyond repair. We drove through the streets and stopped near a large home with a tractor parked outside. The house had been hit by a missile, but the tractor was spared. \"This neighborhood is targeted most often,\" he says pointing at the houses up the hill. \"That one over there took four kornet missiles in less than two minutes and the four in the row below were also hit by missiles as was the hotel on the main road. 4 Metula mayor David Azulay Photo: Efi Sharir Tevia Neistein, a member of the local security team was in his kitchen when a missile exploded in his bedroom. \"That's that,\" he said when we met in the command center, \"The house is gone. Only a pile of dust and stones is left.\" He is a tour guide but now he is on reserves and the tourists are gone. It's not just the destruction. It’s the desolation. The once manicured gardens are covered in dry weeds and some roads are blocked off with barbed wire, put there to slow Hezbollah's elite Radwan force, who are not very far away, if the infiltrate. As Efi, the photographer steps out of the car to take some pictures, Azulay urges him to be quick. \"We are exposed to fire from the El Khiam village across the border, he warns. \"You see those houses there? Anyone in them can see you.\" It is scary but more than that it is sad. Metula was founded 128 years ago at the very tip of the Upper Galilee region. Flanked by Lebanon's villages on three sides. It is a symbol of Zionism, now deserted. Most of its 2,000 residents had been evacuated when the war began and only the security team, a handful of farmers and the mayor remain. \"I am a mayor of no one,\" Azulay says. I've had enough. I want my residents to bug me about garbage collection or street lighting, like any other mayor.\" 4 Metula Photo: Efi Sharir His home is in the area often under attack so he sleeps at the command center. He is a veteran of 25 years of service in the IDF, divorced and a father of four who was raised in Kiryat Shmona, the city down the road, which is also under constant attack. One of his sons is a commander in the reserves and is now fighting in Gaza. \"He was stationed here in the north before they were deployed to Jabaliya and every time I called to check on him he would tell me I was embarrassing him with my worries.\" Azulay's youngest is also in the service and is now in the IDF's officer's school. He was at home when the war broke out recovering from an injury. In the fighting that day, 30 soldiers in his platoon were killed. The two girls are both at university. Azulay says 10% of Metula residents have already decided not to return and he will not even try to convince them otherwise. \"What can I promise them? Nothing,\" he says. \"In the past couple of weeks, the fire has increased considerably, and now the mortars are causing brushfires. We take it and take it, but the government does nothing. Our leaders are all talk but I want to see action. I want 50 homes destroyed on the other side for each one here. How come the airport in Beirut is operating as usual while we can't even access our own homes?\" 4 Home in Metula hit by a missile but the tractor survived Photo: Efi Sharir So will your children have to fight against Lebanon as well? I ask, \"this is our reality,\" he says. \"We have no other country and I have no other home.\" >",

        "content": "If you have been following news out of the USA, you know the midwest is already in the middle of a tough tornado season . Hurricane season, meanwhile, looks like it will be more intense than last year. Then there are earthquakes , which can happen at any time on the west coast (and hit the east coast just last month ). With so many disasters coming at us, preparing for anything and everything is vital. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security strongly recommends people prepare a disaster supply kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers so they can survive on their own for several days should something happen. In addition to storing maps, sanitiser, medications, and pet food for four-legged friends, you’ll need these recommended essentials should disaster strike. An emergency may leave you without clean water for a few days. It is recommended that you keep one gallon of water for each person in your household for several days. To ensure you have enough clean water, pick up this collection of six emergency water storage tanks. Each holds five gallons and comes with two spigots and a water purification kit. Even in a disaster, you have to eat, so why not eat well? This entree kit contains 10 different freeze-dried entrees that last a quarter of a century, including chili mac and mashed potatoes. Altogether, 120 servings of food are inside this rugged flood-safe container that you can store practically anywhere. They say nobody listens to the radio anymore, but it’s your lifeline for staying updated on weather-related catastrophes. This emergency AM/FM/NOAA weather radio is a versatile tool that can be powered by a hand crank, solar power, or USB cable. It also includes a flashlight and an SOS Alarm, giving you multiple modes to stay informed and safe. Most importantly, it can charge your phone, ensuring you stay connected when it matters most. Cuts, bruises, burns, and fevers: this 160-piece first aid kit takes care of everything. It includes all the essentials: cleansing wipes, assorted bandages, rolled gauze, antibiotic cream, itch-stopping cream, acetaminophen caplets, an instant cold pack, and even gloves to reduce the risk of infection. Yes, even nowadays, when everything is rechargeable, you’ll need some AAs, AAAs, and even some 9V batteries to ensure everything is up and running in your home during an emergency. Instead of keeping them in that drawer in your kitchen (you know which one), organize them in the Battery Daddy . My family has had one for years, and it’s always come in handy for testing the batteries we already have and keeping new ones together when we need them most (like Christmas morning). This emergency whistle can be heard from a mile away if you want to get someone’s attention or signal for help. It is also plastic, so there’s no danger of it sticking to your lips when the weather gets cold. In an emergency, the air may be contaminated, so wearing a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to filter out anything harmful will protect your respiratory system and keep you safe. This 10-pack of disposable masks will do the job comfortably and at the right price. If your home is damaged, you will need to put something together quickly to protect it and your family from the elements. Plastic sheeting and duct tape can help you in a pinch, and this dense, heavy-duty product is easy to apply and will cover any area and protect it from the cold, rain, or high winds. If using the toilet isn’t an option, this toilet in a bag will capture your numbers one and two and turn it into something you can dispose of safely without worrying about the smell or attracting disease-spreading insects. Remember to pick up cleaning wipes, which you can purchase as compressed towelettes . After a disaster like an earthquake or fire, you may need to turn off your gas or water lines quickly. However, if the power is out or part of your home is flooded, you might be unable to reach your wrench set. This lightweight, aluminum four-in-one tool can do the job without charging your power tools. In addition to shutting off your utilities, it can also pry open doors so you can get to family members in other parts of your home. Your fancy electric can opener may not work if you need to open a can of food. Be sure to add this sturdy rust-resistant device to your kit to open that tin of peaches or pop open that bottle of beer you’ll need when that storm finally blows over. It’s hard to stay in touch with family and friends if your smartphone battery is dead. With this durable, waterproof, shockproof, and dust-proof solar charger , you can keep all your devices up and running. It also has a bright LED flashlight, so you don’t have to fumble in the dark for your charging cord.

Leclerc bikes home from Monaco GP Still draped in full gear and a fancy watch, Leclerc appeared in someone's rearview mirror for the first time on Sunday as dusk fell on the streets of Monaco. A fan traveling by car recorded the incredible scene as they passed by , just like a regular Monacan would. Formula 1 fans took the and ran with it. Already a fan favorite and the , his humble commute home allowed his legend to grow. Fans adore humble Leclerc \"100% respect. He is so humble. First thing he said after winning, he thanks his father for all the sacrifices he made for him to run. The trophy of life for him,\" one fan lauded in the comments. \"His mom calling that dinner is ready, time to go back home after play for whole day outside,\" joked another to the tune of nearly 3,000 likes. Although it is hard to confirm that it was for sure Leclerc in the video, the unique Ferrari clothes and jewelry seemed to match. One supposed also left a comment on the video on Instagram confirming the story. \"He rode right past me at the exit for the K grandstands as I walked to the train. Baffling. Nobody bothered him. So so cool.\" A local legend After failing to convert a Monaco pole position into a win in 2021, Leclerc tweeted: \"Monaco I love you and hopefully one day you will love me back.\" With the so-called \" \" now broken after a dominant victory over second placed , there is no doubt that day has come.

        "content": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. — On the last Monday in May each year, people around America take the day to honor and mourn the many men and women who died while serving and protecting their country and the freedoms of the people who live there. In Saratoga Springs, members of the community gathered in Congress Park at the War Memorial where Gurtler Brothers VFW Post 420 hosted a commemoration ceremony in honor of the holiday. According to Gene Ratigliano, Post Quartermaster and Past Post and State Commander, this ceremony has been something that has been put on for many years and used to coincide with the Saratoga Springs Memorial Day Parade, which the city has not had for the last couple of years. He believes ceremonies like this one are important, not just because of the significant meaning behind them but because it stands as a reminder of how important it is to remember what these fallen soldiers did for their country. “We need to remember our past, we need to remember our history – if we don’t remember what we’ve done in the past, we’re bound to fail again in the future,” Ratigliano said. “It’s only common sense, and I think it means a lot – it means that people really understand and appreciate what they (the soldiers) did for them.” “The culture we have today is a little bit different than in the past. There are many things going on today that I think previous generations probably would not have put up with. This remembrance brings us back to reality.” The ceremony included a reading of Logan’s Order, which called for a National Day of Remembrance for those who died in the Civil War and was the basis for Memorial Day, as well as a singing of the National Anthem, a rifle salute, taps and a speech from Saratoga Springs Mayor John Safford. Safford shared that participating in these kinds of ceremonies gives him an opportunity as mayor to put emphasis on service and what that means to him as well as other veterans in the community who watched friends die while in the armed forces. During his speech, Safford recognized some of the individuals he knew who died in combat and talked about the respect and honor owed to those who died in uniform. “If there is any of us here that knows what it feels like to lose your friends at 20 years old, to know they died for you in your place, then you know something about what we are doing today,” Safford said in his speech. Safford also pointed out the commemorative bricks along the Veteran’s Walk of Honor, which includes more than 2,000 bricks engraved with the names of local war veterans to memorialize them in front of the War Memorial in Congress Park. Safford explained that many of these individuals were 20 or 21 years old when they died – and their service must be remembered. “They (the soldiers) died for me and for you, the city and this country,” Safford said. “We never should forget that. Never ever. I can tell you that I will never forget that.” Ratigliano shared that he and Safford have been talking and are starting plans to bring the Memorial Day Parade back next year so more people can celebrate the service and the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to ensure the freedoms of Saratogians and Americans in general. In Ratigliano’s eyes, bringing this parade back allows more people to understand and realize what this day really means and what it is honoring.

        "content": "Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of the most successful foreign players to enter the NBA. While the 2013 NBA draftee was not as hyped a pick, Frenchman Alexandre Sarr has quietly risen as the potential #1 pick for the 2024 Draft class. Even though the 7’1” center has received rave reviews about his athleticism, he wants to acquire more skills from the league’s superstars, particularly the Greek Freak. On ‘ Podcast P with Paul George ‘, the lanky Center revealed that he loves to watch Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Talking about a move he’d like to take out of Antetokounmpo’s intimidating skillset, Sarr alluded to his transition game where the power forward uses his 6’11” frame to bump past defenders and rise for a powerful slam . The Bucks forward is well-adept at using spin moves and drop steps to create separation and once he is past the defenders, there is no catching him. The French center would love to develop into a one-man fastbreak like Giannis Antetokounmpo. The 19-year-old is indeed a havoc-wreaker while driving to the rim and uses his 7’4” wingspan to rise above most players. While his skill level might still be ways removed from the Greek superstar, Paul George loves the comparison. Paul George agrees that Sarr is like Giannis Antetokounmpo During the sit-down with the projected #1 draft pick, PG-13 concurred that the former Overtime Elite indeed resembles the Bucks legend in numerous ways. He highlighted their ability to work to snatch a rebound and then trigger a transition by themselves. “ I like the Giannis comparison... I kinda see a similar play style with the ability to get it off the rim and push in transition, handle it, create ,” George told Sarr. Surely, Sarr needs to put on more muscle to tackle the NBA physicality but as a 19-year-old, he is still in the beginning stages of gaining mass. Antetokounmpo also entered as a raw prospect in the NBA and honed his skills steadily to gain prominence. Thus, the lanky Center can take a page out of Antetokounmpo’s book to realize his potential. Moreover, Victor Wembanyama’s rise in his rookie season has quashed doubts about the lean-physique players surviving in the league. As of now, Sarr has his work cut out to sustain in the fast-paced and workload-heavy world of the NBA.",

        "content": "K-pop’s first appearance on the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart was in 2009, when the Wonder Girls’ “Nobody” hit No. 76. Fifty years earlier, in 1959 The Kim Sisters (Sue, Aija, and Mia) from Korea made their American TV premiere on The Ed Sullivan show. So, is 1959 the year that K-Pop made its debut in the US? Probably not, but we should celebrate the importance of The Kim Sisters in representing Korea to the US. They would eventually appear on The Ed Sullivan Show twenty-one times, more than any other act. They performed covers of popular American songs, such as “Charlie Brown” (originally by The Coasters), “Try to Remember” (original song from the musical “The Fantasticks”) and “When the Saints Go Marching In” (traditional Christian hymn covered by Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Elvis, Judy Garland and many others). They sang songs familiar to mainstream American audiences. On one occasion, they performed “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore” and they were joined by their mother who added the occasional “Arirang” lyric, a nod to the traditional Korean song. These young women were remarkable not only because they could sing and dance as well as any of the girl groups popular in the US at the time, but they were also multi-instrumentalists. YouTube clips feature the members playing drums, saxophones, guitars, etc., in their performances. Sue (Kim Sook-ja) and Aija (Kim Ai-ja) were biological sisters. Mia (Kim Min-ja) was Sue and Aija’s cousin who was later adopted by Sue and Aija’s mother, singer Lee Nan-yang. Lee was famous for her 1935 song “Tears of Mokpo.” After the kidnapping and murder of her husband, conductor Kim Hae-song, she had to support herself and her children by entertaining American GIs. She later taught her children how to sing American songs and play musical instruments. Eventually, The Kim Sisters were formed and sent to Las Vegas with their manager, Bob McMackin. Their initial 4 week stint in 1959 at The Thunderbird in Las Vegas led to an additional 35 years in residency in Las Vegas venues including The Stardust, Las Vegas Hilton and the Holiday Casino. I think they deserve a place alongside other Asian American entertainers, perhaps more so than next to K-pop acts. What cemented this position for me was when I discovered their medley of songs from the film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical “Flower Drum Song” (1961). This film is based on a Broadway musical inspired by Chin Yang Lee’s novel of the same title. The story is about Chinese American families in San Francisco, whose parents and children straddle stereotypically traditional Chinese versus American values. It includes Chinese characters who are born in the US and others that are recent arrivals to America. It became the first Hollywood film to feature a majority Asian American cast (and there would not be another one for another 30 years, until “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993). The film was nominated for numerous Academy Awards. The lead actors for the film included Nancy Kwan (biracial Chinese/white American), James Shigeta (Japanese American), Miyoshi Umeki (Japanese American), Jack Soo (Japanese American), Benson Fong (Chinese American), and Juanita Hall (biracial black/white American). Miyoshi Umeki is also the first Asian American actress to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (for “Sayonara.”) These were many of the most well-known Asian American (and Black) actors of the time, but most were not Chinese or Chinese American. Among Asian American fans and scholars, views of “Flower Drum Song” have swung from positive to negative and back again. However, there is no debate about its iconic status for Asian Americans in the history of Hollywood films. As a Chinese American who grew up in San Francisco, I remember seeing this film as a child. I’ve seen it many times since. While songs like “Chop Suey” are a little “cringey,” seeing Asian American actors tell a story about the diversity of Chinese Americans in San Francisco left a deep impression on me. I’ve appreciated the importance of this film, even before I became an academic. The stereotypes of “traditional Chinese” versus “modern American” values is arguably a retrograde representation of the immigrant experience, but the film avoids using white actors in yellowface. There are no white actors with their eyes taped so they might appear “oriental” as was standard practice in Hollywood. Some might complain that not all of the actors were Chinese or Chinese American, but given the period during which this film was produced, the cast is a great leap forward. Despite being born in Korea, The Kim Sisters’ professional careers were built on their performances of American songs arranged to appeal to Americans, from GIs in Korea, to American TV and Las Vegas audiences. Their first job was performing as a part of the “China Doll Revue,” which included Chinese and Japanese American entertainers. They lived most of their lives in the US as Americans. Like the other Asian American actors in “Flower Drum Song,” they were constrained by how white Americans viewed Asian Americans. They could convincingly sing about a Chinese American family not only because they were seen as Korean, but also as Asian American.

        "content": "Article content Opposition New Democrats say the Alberta government is being anti-democratic by invoking time allocation measures that limit debate around some of its most controversial bills ahead of the end of the legislative session later this week. Last week, government house leader Joseph Schow introduced motions to limit debate on four separate bills, including Bill 20, which the government introduced amendments to last week following widespread backlash . The motions limit the time allotted for debate to one hour for each stage of each bill. “Be it resolved that when further consideration of Bill 20, Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment Act, 2024, is resumed, not more than one hour shall be allotted to any further consideration of the bill in second reading, at which time every question necessary for the disposal of the bill at this stage shall be put forthwith,” states one such motion that was tabled last Tuesday. Schow defended the use of time allocation, saying it is needed to get through the government’s agenda. “There’s a difference between productive debate and just extended debate. I think we’ve reached a point where we may be past productive debate,” he said, accusing the Opposition NDP of being “obstructionist.” “I think robust discussion is ongoing in that chamber. But I also recognize and believe that ... if the Opposition is not interested in bringing forth new ideas, then we’re going to move forward in time allocation so that we can get through the legislative agenda.” He added the government also had invoked a motion to hold evening sittings from Monday through Wednesday, starting Monday night, in an effort to get through the bills. “We have a mandate from Albertans that was given to us in the last election,” he said, adding “we have a job to do.” “We’re going to use the tools at our disposal to get out at a reasonable time.” Opposition house leader Christina Gray said the government is on pace to use time allocation 50 times compared to her party who used it on four occasions when it was in power. “It’s incredibly frustrating and shameful that the government continues to eliminate time for debate on legislation that Albertans deeply care about,” she said. “It’s really a continuation of the pattern we’ve seen from this government and it’s doing a huge disservice to Albertans as well as being not what this government ran on.” She denied her party was being obstructionist and accused the government of ramming through its agenda. “This government feels entitled to pass any legislation that they feel they can without consulting with Albertans.” As of the start of Monday’s afternoon sitting, the bills impacted are: The current spring sitting of the legislature is scheduled to end late Thursday afternoon, although it may also wrap up ahead of then. — with files from Cindy Tran mblack@postmedia.com",

Memorial Day exists to remember and honor those military members who died in service of our country. Yet, Joe Biden ALWAYS mentions his dead son, Beau. Beau did NOT die in service his country. He died of cancer. Also, Biden claims — without proof — that Beau's brain cancer... pic.twitter.com/O6el3k2POq On Memorial Day, Biden chose to highlight the loss of his son, Beau. Biden is unable to accept Beau died of cancer and not in war, and insists it was as a result of his service and 'burn pits'. There is no evidence that is true. Unsurprisingly, Joe Biden made #MemorialDay about him and his family via the injection of his son Beau's death from brain cancer resulting from burn pits. 👉Six years after his service I'm not saying that many haven't died from cancers linked to burn pits, but Beau was there... pic.twitter.com/QgeYvYYSLf Injecting a bit of reality into the situation. Joe Biden just had to talk about Beau while giving a speech at Arlington. NO, Senile Moron Joe Biden, your son Beau was NOT killed in combat in Iraq! He died of cancer in his bed! By continously spouting that execrable canard you are committing Stolen Valor! It is an insult to all of us who ever wore the uniform of the United States Military! Now, STOP... As horrific as losing any child must be, Biden needs to recognize he had the chance to say goodbye to his child, surrounded by family with the gift of palliative care. Most families of lost soldiers do not have that kind of ending. Biden is a self-centered pr@ck that can never leave his name his story out of any national event Sick of hearing about his son, dying of cancer and comparing it to the brave heroes gave their lives to save their country https://t.co/Yq50kx1qNq I’m sorry for his loss but this was not the time or place. Why does everything have to be about him? https://t.co/IqZMHNjDbd Of course, people feel empathy for his loss, but why must he center his loss at every occasion about loss? He has issues with not being relatable and narcissism. He can’t not talk about himself when he should be talking about the needs of regular folks The crazy thing is apparently his team has told him people don't like the constant references and he should stop always bringing up his son, but he does not care and continues to do it. Always has to be about him. I HAVE NO WORDS 😡, he also went political during his \"speech\" . Typical Biden fashion. Those 2 things didn't belong in today's speech. Why is it he NEVER says God Bless America 🇺🇸? Oh No - Not Again! President Biden uses the Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery as another reason to bring up the death of his son, Beau Biden. There appears to be no solemn event that he will not attach to the tragic death of his son. Was it appropriate of Joe... pic.twitter.com/V8TuSVelDI He's a daily national embarrassment. November cannot come soon enough.",

        "content": "Kendall Waston se sinceró, se desahogó, tras lograr el campeonato con el Deportivo Saprissa. Terminó el partido contra Alajuelense y se fue a saludar a su esposa y a su hijo, únicos testigos del sufrimiento de Kendall durante varios meses, pues padeció una pubalgia en diciembre del año pasado y estuvo cinco meses sin actuar, pero antes de reaparecer en los terrenos de juego, el defensa vivió un martirio: llegó a deprimirse y llorar de impotencia. “Lloré muchísimas veces, lloré a escondidas de mi esposa para que no me viera con dolor, porque uno, como cabeza de hogar, quiere estar fuerte. Tuve que abrirme a ella, serle sincero y decirle por lo que pasaba”, dijo Kendall. Waston nunca había estado tanto tiempo sin jugar, por eso calificó el Clausura 2024 como el torneo más difícil por la lesión y todo lo que vivió. “Sufrí bastante, pero también así es como se disfruta más. Me pasó por la mente si no volvería a jugar, si me tendría que retirar. Hubo momentos donde no me podía levantar de la cama, fue muy complicado, casi que me arrastraba para poder moverme y gracias a Dios con la ayuda de él salí adelante”, recordó Kendall. Waston manifestó que su esposa fue su gran soporte; ella le hizo ver que debía luchar, que no podía terminar ahí sin volver a una cancha de fútbol. Al zaguero lo atormentaba enfrentar una lesión que no sabía cuánto tiempo lo iba a dejar fuera. ''10 años atrás pude ser partícipe de lograr la 30, siempre ganar títulos es lindísimo'', Kendall Waston Pero esperó, fue paciente y el cinco de este mes volvió a sentirse futbolista. Ese día, Saprissa visitó a Puntarenas, Kendall ingresó en los últimos minutos, lo hizo como delantero y anotó. “Creo que el más sorprendido por esa anotación fui yo, pero bendito Dios que me dio el privilegio de jugar y anotar. Yo siempre oraba y le decía, si usted me tiene aquí por algo es y solo quiero cumplir su voluntad”, destacó Kendall Waston. Cuando a Kendall se le consultó cuánto le sabía el título 40, lo pensó poco, mostró su gran sonrisa y soltó la respuesta. “Me sabe riquísimo, riquisísimo”, dijo Kendall, al tiempo que soltó una carcajada. (Mayela López) Waston estaba seguro de que le iban a dar vuelta a la serie contra Alajuelense y ganar la final. Señaló que en el grupo había mucha convicción y se inyectaron de motivación por el recibimiento de la afición al llegar al estadio morado. “Yo sabía que cuando cayera el primer gol, iban a llegar los demás. Ver el estadio vibrar no es fácil de llevar y le sacamos ventaja a la localía”, dijo Waston. Un tema que no se podía dejar de lado es la Selección y Kendall reiteró que quiere estar en el grupo que dirige Gustavo Alfaro. “Yo lo dije en su momento, no le voy a cerrar nunca las puertas a la Selección, mientras esté jugando, soy un soldado más. Si me llaman, voy; si no, voy a darlo todo para estar disponible”, comentó Kendall Waston.",

        "content": "THE MUMBAI police SIT probing the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse case summoned Assistant Commissioner of Police with the Government Railway Police (GRP) S Nikam to appear before them on Tuesday to record his statement and provide some documents. The ACP’s name featured on some of the documents related to granting permissions for the hoarding following which he has been called to record his statement. An officer said that as part of their probe, they have found that the land on which the hoarding was erected did not belong to railways and ideally should have had permission from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Advertisement The police will also be writing to the BMC seeking to find out how an illegal hoarding could come up in their jurisdiction without them taking any action. As many as 17 people were killed when a hoarding collapsed on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13. The SIT has arrested owner of the hoarding Bhavesh Bhinde, who is in their custody till Wednesday.",

In a country obsessed with fair skin (slang — gori chamdi) and ‘foreign figures’ (slang — videshi maal) an (un)healthy trend has crept into the power corridors of the rich and famous. Many private yacht soirees, high-end clubs, car show events, realty project launches, foo-foo fine dining restaurants, and the whole wedding shebang are hiring foreigners from the UK, France, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Central Asia as ‘white eye candy’ ushers, entertainers, human tables, bartenders, and dancers. The unhealthy gaze of some uncouth wealthy desi men can be repulsive but the money is good and hard cash. Many event managers opine that white-skinned men and women raise the ‘oomph factor’. While the quick dough generated through wine and cheese tasting ‘human table’ or gyrating on desi songs is prevalent, the underlying reality highlights the need to sustain oneself in a low-paying industry.",

        "content": "What advice does an Olympian have for those starting out running? David Gillick raced for Ireland in the 2008 Olympics and currently holds the indoor and outdoor Irish 400m records. Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , Mr Gillick said it was important to remember to stretch as “you’re asking an awful lot from your body”. “If you could add in simple things like squats, lunges, press ups,” he said. “Things like that that can just kind [of] help the body adapt to what you’re asking them to do. “It’s going to take a pounding along the pavement, so you need to have a robust body that can take that extra work and that extra load.” Mr Gillick said forming good habits early on will pay off if you are serious about running. “If you are at the early stages, building in some basic exercises can really help you in the long-term,” he said. “Whether you’re elite or whether you’re a more seasoned runner, essence is key and even in the elite athletes are doing that probably as many times as they’re running... So, if you’re starting out, do try and build in some form of strength and conditioning or even resistance work.” As with many things, it pays to ramp things up slowly and Mr Gillick suggested increasing the mileage you run each time in a gradual manner. “People will look towards the end of the year and think, ‘Oh, it’s October’ for say the Dublin Marathon,” he said. “Start now and build it up; so again, you could be going for your 90 minute runs and then build it to 1.40 hours, 1.45 hours. “Don’t make any massive jumps because that will inflict a lot of issues in terms of physical impact.” You can listen back here: Main image: Ireland's David Gillick performs on men's 400 meters final during the European athletics indoor championships in Birmingham, UK on March 3, 2007.

As the live series well and truly got underway, presenting duo Ant and Dec stepped on stage, reminding viewers that this was the first live show, as auditions are previously recorded, reports the Mirror . Catching up with judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon, and Bruno Tonioli , Simon momentarily halted the chat, eager to express his congratulations to new father Ant. Only days ago, Ant and wife Anne-Marie welcomed baby Wilder into the world, with Ant thanking fans for their support via social media over their joyous family addition. Announcing his newborn, he penned: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick Mcpartlin. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy's a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad's a mess!\" He followed up with another post explaining why Hurley, his beloved pet, was not visible on the family tree tattoo, hidden by their newest member. It read: \"Hey all, I just wanted to say thank You so much for the kind messages of love and well wishes for our baby Wilder. He's doing great. Glad you loved the tattoo as well. For all you dog lovers who asked why my beloved Hurley wasn't on the family tree... he was! ! He was just covered by our newborn. All my love, gratitude and heartfelt thanks.

The fund operates an open application process, allowing founders to apply without an introduction, OpenseedVC noted. According to the firm, Rotilu, an experienced operator turned investor, brings extensive market expertise from scaling multinational technology startups like Uber and Branch to millions of users. It stated that she had also invested in global companies as a Principal & Fund Manager of the Octopus Ventures First Cheque Fund and served as managing director at the Oxford Seed Fund of Oxford University, one of the leading producers of unicorns in Europe. OpenseedVC stated that it had already made its first two investments in the Future of Commerce and Health themes, including an AI-enabled supplier dispute resolution software in the UK and a foundational speech-to-text transcription model for underserved accents, starting with Africa. Speaking on the launch of OpenseedVC Fund, Rotilu said, “As an operator, and investor, I have encountered incredibly talented and experienced operators, and the challenges faced as they try to launch their startups.” According to him, operators have the advantage of domain expertise and unique insight into large problems that can be tackled with innovative technology. “Those who are visionaries coupled with the ability to execute, scale, build teams and have the grit required to solve difficult problems—these skills, especially in the current market, are highly relevant to building technology start-ups that solve real problems and create scalable value for the global economy and our investors. “The experience seasoned operators bring in terms of business building, combined with the dynamism and hustle that founders possess is the focus for OpenseedVC,” Rotilu expounded.",

        "content": "LESS than a week on since Rishi Sunak’s unimpressive announcement in Downing Street about the election on July 4, where are we? Well, for most people life has gone on entirely as normal. That, for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, is a problem. As it happens, life was continuing for me in a very normal way. My wife’s niece, Juliet, was getting married in the North East of England and I was under strict instructions that the weekend was not to be filled with “politics”. Instead, a celebration of people coming together, building a life together and putting politics into perspective. For those of us who have been steeped in politics for years — in my case, 60 years this year as a member of the Labour Party — we often forget that people “have a life” which does not involve listening to politicians or getting deeply engaged with political arguments. If Labour is to win an overall majority, and this is by no means certain, reaching those people who are not “switched on” and, therefore, connected and engaged with the political debate will be critical. ­Surely the lesson, so far, is don’t attack your political opponent on issues and in a manner which is frankly unbelievable. This was the lesson of the 1997 election, when the Conservatives portrayed Tony Blair , with “demon eyes”, as some sort of threat. The visual images were such that people ridiculed what they knew to be entirely untrue. In this election it is the notion that the nation’s security is somehow at risk from a Starmer government. Given that Sir Keir has been absolutely, 100 per cent behind Government policy in terms of committing to and supporting Ukraine , and that all the crazy notions of Jeremy Corbyn five years ago are now for the birds, this line of attack is doomed from the start. Not least because the Prime Minister’s commitment to raising defence spending is not for the next Parliament , but for the one after — in 2030! In what is undoubtedly going to be a brutal few weeks, unlikely to do great credit to sensible and balanced dialogue or to trust and engagement with politics, there are issues which will be, in my terms, “toxic”. Immigration is clearly one such issue. As a home secretary, over 20 years ago, who reached an agreement with the French which cut those coming across from Calais by two-thirds, I’m painfully aware of the practical and political challenges that exist. However, Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a General Election unexpectedly in the summer has denied the Conservatives the right to claim that their so-called “Rwanda policy” is working. On the other hand, it has avoided the total embarrass- ment of calmer seas resulting in literally tens of thousands of people crossing the Channel despite the threat of being transported to East Africa . I wouldn’t say that there is “method in Rishi Sunak’s madness” because failure to give your own policy a chance to work isn’t a great offer to the electorate. But the more profound issue is the countless numbers of people who have been labelled by recent legislation as “illegal” and are completely stuck in the system. These are people who came across the Channel without documentation and can’t claim asylum . They are not being processed, not going anywhere and costing us a fortune. Here’s a thought. Why would anyone, after the last turbulent and, some would say (including me), disastrous 14 years, vote Conservative? I will, during the General Election, come back to this theme, but suffice it to say that, despite my tribal ideology and commitment to the Labour Party, I am not yet convinced that Labour will win by an avalanche. Pollsters and pundits all think it is a foregone conclusion. I’m not so sure. Labour enter this election with only 205 MPs thanks to the antics of Jeremy Corbyn and the far Left. There needs to be the most enormous swing of more than 12 per cent to get an overall majority, and this involves overturning Conservative seats where, in 2019, they won by 15,000 to 16,000 votes! It is a mountain to climb. So, although I wish, profoundly, that I am wrong, I predict, at this stage of the General Election, that a good result for Labour would be an overall majority of 20. I don’t believe the Conservatives can win, but I think it is by no means certain that Labour are yet home and dry. Complacency is always the killer.",

Whatever you do while decorating, make sure to avoid drag beige shades at all costs. Instead, don't be afraid to try something new when reinvigorating a room. \"Color is back and we love it,\" Laura Fox, founder of Laura Fox Interiors Design , explained on her website. She shared her advice for incorporating vibrant hues into your space. When transforming a space, her biggest tip is to \"think outside the box.\" To accomplish this, Fox suggests focusing on one particular - and usually overlooked - area. \"Paint your cabinets, not the walls,\" she said. Fox also wants you to face your decorating fears. \"Don't be afraid to go dark,\" she said. \"Espresso, red, and charcoal have a dramatic effect on the finished look of the room,\" she added. Another way to show off your style is with some stripes. And that wasn't the only pro tip she shared. \"Go further than the walls and change up the mood of a room by adding an accent-colored furniture piece,\" she said. Affordable furniture retailer Wayfair sells a Cache metal end table with storage which is on sale for $76.06. The functional find also comes in a range of colors. Choose from yellow, orange, mint, magenta, bright blue and more shades. This will surely add some shine to your space. Lastly, she recommends how to best make things \"pop.\" All it takes is painting an accent wall. For a \"calming\" feel, you can opt for cool colors such as blue and green tones. \"Adding these colors to your walls will help create a relaxing environment,\" she said.

With shelters struggling to keep up with the demand for crisis housing, she speaks to chief executive of Women’s Community Shelters Annabelle Daniel about the crisis. You can listen here: Inside a women’s shelter at the height of a national crisis - podcast Read more And she has also written a feature about what she found at the shelter and how it is helping women and often their children to rebuild their lives. Read her full piece here: ‘A long time to become a survivor’: a shelter helped Julia rebuild – but many NSW women are being turned away Read more Share 6m ago 23.00 CEST Australia to give $2.5m to help with PNG landslide response The Australian government will give $2.5m in humanitarian assistance to help Papua New Guinea respond to the Enga province landslide, which has claimed the lives of at least 670 . In an announcement last night, the Albanese government said emergency relief supplies, such as shelter, hygiene kits and specific support for women and children would be provided. Australia would also send technical experts to offer incident management assistance, support geohazard assessments and to help with early recovery efforts. Yesterday, Papua New Guinea’s national disaster centre asked the United Nations for international assistance , reportedly saying the landslide in the country’s remote north could have buried more than 2,000 people. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles , said Australians will be thinking of PNG at this very difficult time. He said: As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support. Australia’s defence force is working closely with the PNG Defence Force to assist with the response. This work is yet another demonstration of the close partnership between our nations and militaries.

My name is Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you the best of the overnight stories before Amy Remeikis takes over in a bit. The Albanese government is assembling an expert panel to examine the rise in violence against women and will recommend new approaches to try to curb the problem. There have been a spate of high-profile incidents this year, most recently last week’s double murder in Perth of Jennifer Petelczyc and her daughter Gretl . We have more details coming up, plus a feature and podcast by Full Story presenter Nour Haydar on a new women’s shelter in Parramatta in western Sydney. As the federal parliament returns for two weeks, our environment editor Adam Morton bemoans the lack of clear policies to tackle the climate crisis and issues an impassioned plea for a change. On the one hand the government appears confused and wedged by the gas industry – especially in Western Australia where Labor is in power and can’t turn against such a powerful lobby. And on the other hand, Coalition hasn’t even got a policy. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5m in initial aid to Papua New Guinea as the death toll continues to rise after a catastrophic landslide that destroyed a village . PNG’s disaster centre said more than 2,000 people had been buried alive by Friday’s landslide in remote Enga province. Under the Australian aid package experts will provide incident management assistance, support geo-hazard assessments and help early recovery efforts, with the Australian defence force also assisting.

Thousands upon...The post Troy Deeney blasts actions of ‘four or five’ Leeds players on Wembley pitch after play-off final appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "Thousands upon thousands of Leeds fans descended to the capital hoping for history to be wiped out and not repeat itself. But it wasn’t meant to be for Daniel Farke and his players because, for the fourth time in their history, were beaten in a play-off final at Wembley or The Millennium Stadium. For a lot of fans, it was hard to take, not just because they were beaten in another or they were going to spend another season in England’s second tier. But because the majority of their players, , didn’t turn up and that’s what will hurt more. When the final whistle blew, you could understand the elation and joy in the eyes of the Southampton players because they celebrated like every team would do in their situation, But many of the Leeds players had their heads down and looked utterly distraught because a 49-game season has now ended with virtually nothing. Troy Deeney was pitchside at Wembley and he simply didn’t like what he saw from some of the Leeds players after the full-time whistle. The former striker, who has won promotion to the Premier League with Watford, slammed ‘four or five players’ for ‘laughing and joking’ when the game had finished, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:50 pm). Deeney wasn’t shy to point out his own troubles at the home of football and losing 6-0 to Manchester City in an FA Cup final, so he is someone who can speak from experience. Leeds United players at Wembley “When I look at Leeds, the last month flattered to deceive where you want your big players, your leaders to step up and they went missing,” said Deeney. “I am not going to name names, but you are standing and you can see how people react after. I have lost here (at Wembley) 6-0 to Manchester City. That was a drubbing. You have got to stand there, in a line, clap your opponents, well done and the better team won. Show a bit of humility and respect. “Four or five of them over the other side laughing and joking.” Recovering from another play-off final defeat Under Marcelo Bielsa, Leeds also lost a play-off – semi-final against Derby County – before going on to win the title the following season. When Farke won promotion with Norwich, he did so in his second season. Many would point towards that as a good omen for the club, but you feel these are different circumstances. In comparison to those teams, there is probably going to be more of a clearout this summer, with big players leaving and it will make Farke’s life more difficult. That’s why it’s paramount the club keep him at the club because it wouldn’t be a surprise if, , more than a few players departed.",

        "content": "We may have witnessed Rafael Nadal play at the French Open for the final time in his career. A 3-6, 6-7, 3-6 loss against Alexander Zverev results in the Spaniard being eliminated from the Grand Slam. While Rafa gave hints towards a potential retirement, he also delighted fans with the idea of him stepping foot on the Court Philippe-Chatrier in the next few weeks. While it may be the last time that Rafael Nadal participated in Roland Garros, he expressed his desire to set foot on the Court Philippe-Chatrier during the upcoming Olympics. Stating that his next main goal was to represent Spain in the Paris Games 2024, Nadal said: Rafael Nadal will most likely be given the special qualification by the Olympic Games to the former Grand Slam and Olympic champions. However, there could be a huge possibility that the Raging Bull doesn’t only participate in one, but two events during the prestigious sporting gala later in July. Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz Aim to Pair Up for Doubles Event in the Olympics 2024 While the possibility of Rafael Nadal participating in the French Open 2024 is exciting, tennis fans are even more hyped after also learning about the potential team-up with Carlos Alcaraz. A month ago, Rafa spoke about his participation in the Olympics, particularly in the men’s doubles event. Responding to this, the former World No.1 shed light on the idea of a playing double alongside his younger compatriot. The thought of sharing the court with his role model excited Alcaraz as well. While the duo won’t be regarded as the favorites to win the event, they will surely have the undivided attention of the entire tennis world when they take on the court.",

        "description": "Everyone loves food, and you can learn more about traditions surrounding our food and meals at the DeKalb History Center in Sycamore.",
        "content": "We all love food, and the DeKalb County History Center presents a new exhibition about the history and traditions surrounding our food and meals. “Food: Gathering Around the Table” will open with a grand reception from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, June 1, at the , 1730 N. Main St., Sycamore. According to the DeKalb County History Center, the exhibit will explore natural resources, local food traditions, food technology and food as an autobiography. Because food traditions are diverse and evolving, the intersection of American culture is an important factor in American food, the history’s website states. Michelle Donahoe, executive director of the DeKalb County History Center, said she and her team have been working for more than a year to research, identify photos and objects, and conduct interviews with residents for the exhibit. There are five main sections to the exhibit. The first is “Land of Plenty,” which focuses on Native American food traditions, hunting and gathering, local farming and food insecurity; “Local in Locale” presents stories about area restaurants, festivals and more; “Dynamic Delivery” shares information about food and its relationship to technology and local businesses; “Home Cooking” showcases historical cookbooks, old kitchen utensils and fine china that was used for special occasions. The fifth section is a hands-on activity area for kids. “The display really has something for everyone – young, old, current residents and those from out of town,” Donahoe said. “I think it really shows how food brings us together. Food has unrivaled power to connect people with place, to create an identity for a community or region, and to plant an enduring memory for people passing through.” The history center collaborated on the exhibit with the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution’s Museum on Main Street program, which helped provide the framework. Donahoe and her staff worked to find the local stories to complement those themes. “‘Food’ was a national competition directed by the Smithsonian’s Museum on Main Street team in Washington, D.C., and we were very honored to be selected,” she said. “Their input on the exhibit, programs and outreach has made this one of the most engaging displays ever.” Donahoe understands that not everyone is interested in local history, but said that everyone loves food, and the exhibit will appeal to folks from all over the area, not just DeKalb County residents. “Food can be an adventure when you try something new, it can be comforting when you enjoy a traditional favorite, it can energize when [you] eat something you have grown, and it can be a way to rally our community to bring support to that special cause,” she said. “In other words, this exhibit is about history, but it presents it in a fun and creative way. There is really something for everyone.” The exhibit will run for about two years, Donahoe said. The history center also received a grant from Illinois Humanities to host a podcast about food, and more details are expected to be released in coming months, she said. For more details, visit .",

        "content": "From crowdfunding to the use of recycled paper and clothes – the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has said that its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Surat next month is set to be a sustainable event. The event is scheduled to be held between June 7 and June 9. Over 1,500 used denim trousers were collected from college students under a campaign that went on for a week. These will be refurbished as bags to be used during the event, said organisers. “We visited over 80 college and university campuses to collect used denims from students between May 7 and May 14. These have been handed over to Mahil Gruh Udhyog (women self help groups) to make shoulder bags that will be distributed among participants during the NEC meet,” ABVP Gujarat secretary Samarth Bhatt told The Indian Express . Advertisement The NEC meeting to be held in Parvat Patiya area of Surat is expected to witness a participation of nearly 500 student representatives from across the country. The student body, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), also opted for crowdfunding to finance the event. Around Rs 5 lakh has been collected from textile and diamond markets of Surat by a team of ABVP members. “Five teams of ten each collected funds from textile and diamond merchants in Surat. This exercise was conducted to ensure social or community participation in the national event and also to reflect that the funds thus collected are used responsibly,” Samarth Bhatt added. To go paperless, the ABVP has launched a mobile app — especially for the meeting — where resolutions will be uploaded. Suggestions will also be sought on the app. Moreover, organisers also say they prefer the use of recycled paper throughout the event. The diaries to be used are made from recycled paper collected from students. Along with being a plastic-free event, the banners will be made of cloth, ABVP state media convenor Meet Bhavsar said. On June 6, a felicitation event will be followed by a cultural event. The NEC event is to be inaugurated on June 7 where ABVP representatives will deliberate on social, education and organisational issues, say organisers.",

A police officer observed the motorcycle initially driven at 8:46 p.m. Saturday in the area of Powell and Livingston streets had no working taillights, according to a news release from the Streator Police Department. The officer attempted to catch up with the motorcyclist with emergency lights and a spotlight activated, but the motorcyclist continued to ride northbound on Illinois Street, according to police. As the motorcyclist approached Main Street, the cyclist made a left turn onto Main Street, then attempted a quick right turn to continue northbound on Illinois Street on the other side of railroad tracks, but he failed to make that second (right) turn properly and was ejected from the motorcycle, police said. The Streator Fire Department and Ambulance assisted the injured man, who was taken to Peoria by medical helicopter. The man died in Peoria as a result of the injuries, police said.",

        "description": "Financials unchanged from previously disclosed preliminary resultsMONTREAL, May 27, 2024 /CNW/ - (NYSE:CAE) (TSX:CAE) - CAE Inc. (CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Financial results are unchanged from preliminary data that CAE disclosed on May 21, 2024, including the re-baselining of the Defense & Security business along with Defense & Security impairments and unfavourable contract adjustments related to eight previously identified fixed-price legacy contracts (the Legacy Contracts). All financial information is in Canadian dollars.\"Last week we acted decisively and took the necessary steps to provide a clear path to margin improvement in our Defense business, supported by compelling long-term secular trends for this segment,\" said Marc Parent, CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a result of the changes we have made, we have a more balanced risk profile going forward, and with Nick Leontidis as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), we are well-positioned to further strengthen our execution capabilities and drive additional synergies between our Civil and Defense segments.\"As previously disclosed, in Civil, the larger of CAE's two businesses, record margins and orders position the Company well in the fiscal year ahead with expected low double-digit percentage Civil annual adjusted segment operating income growth and continued margin strengthening, with an annual adjusted segment operating income margin of approximately 23%. For Defense, CAE continues to expect fiscal 2025 revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range and annual Defense adjusted segment operating income margin in the 6- to 7-percent range.As announced separately today, the TSX has approved the re-establishment of CAE's normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The NCIB will commence on May 30, 2024 and end on May 29, 2025. The decision of the Board of Directors to re-establish the NCIB reflects CAE's current outlook and the cash generative nature of its highly recurring revenue business. CAE's Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing a shareholder dividend.Consolidated resultsFourth quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1,126.3 million, compared with $1,197.4 million last year.

Additional information pertaining to Defense Legacy ContractsAs previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo.The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits.Additional financial detailsCAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of $55.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre).The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to $39.3 million, mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately $10 million of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on May 21, 2024, to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses.Net finance expense this quarter amounted to $52.4 million, compared to $52.4 million in the preceding quarter and $50.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.Income tax recovery this quarter was $80.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate(1), which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in Europe partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions.Net income from discontinued operations was $20.5 million this quarter compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $16.5 million in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business.Summary of results from discontinued operationsFY2024FY2023Q4-2024Q4-2023Revenue$ 131.7$ 192.7$ 14.8$ 59.1Expenses132.7184.720.050.8Operating (loss) income$ (1.0)$ 8.0$ (5.2)$ 8.3Finance expense3.64.10.61.0(Loss) earnings before income taxes$ (4.6)$ 3.9$ (5.8)$ 7.3Income tax (recovery) expense(9.4)1.8(9.8)2.5Net income from discontinued operations before after-taxgain on disposal$ 4.8$ 2.1$ 4.0$ 4.8After-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations16.5—16.5—Net income from discontinued operations$ 21.3$ 2.1$ 20.5$ 4.8Net cash provided by operating activities was $215.2 million for the quarter compared to $180.6 million in the fourth quarter last year.

For the year, net cash provided by operating activities was $566.9 million compared to $408.4 million last year and free cash flow was $418.2 million, compared to $333.1 million in the same period last year. The cash conversion rate(1) for fiscal year 2024 was 151%.Growth and maintenance capital expenditures(1) totaled $91.7 million this quarter and $329.8 million for the year, mainly in support of accretive growth opportunities to expand the Civil global aviation training network.Net debt(1) at the end of the year was $2,914.2 million for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA(1) of 3.17 times (2.89 times excluding Legacy Contracts(1)). This compares to net debt of $3,085.4 million, for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.16 times at the end of the preceding quarter.Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE)(1) was 5.9% this quarter compared to 7.0% last quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted ROCE includes the impact of $90.3 million in unfavourable Defense contract adjustments.(1) This press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures.

Upon approval, these ambitious targets will guide our decarbonization journey organized around four value streams: aviation, sourcing, products and services, and buildings, which will help us transition from carbon neutrality to net zero emissions. Such an objective requires the mobilization of all our value chain which is why we introduced our new Supply Chain Management Program, CAE Resilient Together, designed to mutually reinforce both operational excellence and sustainability with our partners. Our carbon built-on approach extends to our business strategic planning and decision-making as we know that sustainability is a paramount long-term value driver. We have also contributed to raise awareness on the crucial role of sustainable aviation fuel via CAE Crew Training, for all business aviation pilots training with us. In addition, we remain strongly committed to creating social value and fostering an inclusive and diverse culture. Our efforts to strengthen relations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada and around the world have been recognized through our first certification as a Progressive Aboriginal Relations Bronze company.To learn more about CAE's corporate sustainability roadmap and achievements, the report can be downloaded at https://www.cae.com/social-responsibility/.Management outlook for fiscal year 2025CAE confirms all of the 2025 guidance originally disclosed on May 21, 2024, including for Civil and Defense, for finance expense and tax expense, and for balanced capital allocation priorities and accretive growth investments.CAE reiterates that a tenet of its capital management priorities includes the maintenance of a solid financial position, and it expects to continue to bolster its balance sheet through ongoing deleveraging, commensurate with its investment grade profile.Management's outlook for fiscal year 2025 and the targets outlined in CAE's May 21, 2024 press release (https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo) and expectations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and are based on a number of assumptions, including in relation to prevailing market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, supply chains and labor markets.

(CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 . Financial results are unchanged from preliminary data that CAE disclosed on May 21, 2024 , including the re-baselining of the Defense & Security business along with Defense & Security impairments and unfavourable contract adjustments related to eight previously identified fixed-price legacy contracts (the Legacy Contracts). All financial information is in Canadian dollars. \"Last week we acted decisively and took the necessary steps to provide a clear path to margin improvement in our Defense business, supported by compelling long-term secular trends for this segment,\" said Marc Parent , CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a result of the changes we have made, we have a more balanced risk profile going forward, and with Nick Leontidis as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), we are well-positioned to further strengthen our execution capabilities and drive additional synergies between our Civil and Defense segments.\" As previously disclosed, in Civil, the larger of CAE's two businesses, record margins and orders position the Company well in the fiscal year ahead with expected low double-digit percentage Civil annual adjusted segment operating income growth and continued margin strengthening, with an annual adjusted segment operating income margin of approximately 23%. For Defense, CAE continues to expect fiscal 2025 revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range and annual Defense adjusted segment operating income margin in the 6- to 7-percent range. As announced separately today, the TSX has approved the re-establishment of CAE's normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The NCIB will commence on May 30, 2024 and end on May 29, 2025 . The decision of the Board of Directors to re-establish the NCIB reflects CAE's current outlook and the cash generative nature of its highly recurring revenue business. CAE's Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing a shareholder dividend.

For the year, Civil booked orders for a record $3.0 billion , including 64 FFS sales (vs. 62 in the prior fiscal year) and comprehensive, long-term training agreements with customers worldwide. The Civil book-to-sales ratio was 1.19x for the quarter and 1.24x for the last 12 months.

Additional information pertaining to Defense Legacy Contracts As previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo . The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits. Additional financial details CAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of $55.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre). The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to $39.3 million , mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately $10 million of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on May 21, 2024 , to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses. Net finance expense this quarter amounted to $52.4 million , compared to $52.4 million in the preceding quarter and $50.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Income tax recovery this quarter was $80.6 million , representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate (1) , which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in Europe partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions. Net income from discontinued operations was $20.5 million this quarter compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $16.5 million in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business. Summary of results from discontinued operations FY2024 FY2023 Q4-2024 Q4-2023 Revenue $ 131.7 $ 192.7 $ 14.8 $ 59.1 Expenses 132.7 184.7 20.0 50.8 Operating (loss) income $ (1.0) $ 8.0 $ (5.2) $ 8.3 Finance expense 3.6 4.1 0.6 1.0 (Loss) earnings before income taxes $ (4.6) $ 3.9 $ (5.8) $ 7.3 Income tax (recovery) expense (9.4) 1.8 (9.8) 2.5 Net income from discontinued operations before after-tax gain on disposal $ 4.8 $ 2.1 $ 4.0 $ 4.8 After-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations 16.5 — 16.5 — Net income from discontinued operations $ 21.3 $ 2.1 $ 20.5 $ 4.8 Net cash provided by operating activities was $215.2 million for the quarter compared to $180.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow (1) was $191.1 million for the quarter compared to $147.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities was $566.9 million compared to $408.4 million last year and free cash flow was $418.2 million , compared to $333.1 million in the same period last year. The cash conversion rate (1) for fiscal year 2024 was 151%. Growth and maintenance capital expenditures (1) totaled $91.7 million this quarter and $329.8 million for the year, mainly in support of accretive growth opportunities to expand the Civil global aviation training network. Net debt (1) at the end of the year was $2,914.2 million for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (1) of 3.17 times (2.89 times excluding Legacy Contracts (1) ). This compares to net debt of $3,085.4 million , for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.16 times at the end of the preceding quarter. Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) (1) was 5.9% this quarter compared to 7.0% last quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted ROCE includes the impact of $90.3 million in unfavourable Defense contract adjustments.

Sustainability This quarter, CAE submitted near-term (10 years) science-based reduction targets for validation by SBTi, an achievement that positions CAE on the net zero trajectory. Upon approval, these ambitious targets will guide our decarbonization journey organized around four value streams: aviation, sourcing, products and services, and buildings, which will help us transition from carbon neutrality to net zero emissions. Such an objective requires the mobilization of all our value chain which is why we introduced our new Supply Chain Management Program, CAE Resilient Together, designed to mutually reinforce both operational excellence and sustainability with our partners. Our carbon built-on approach extends to our business strategic planning and decision-making as we know that sustainability is a paramount long-term value driver. We have also contributed to raise awareness on the crucial role of sustainable aviation fuel via CAE Crew Training, for all business aviation pilots training with us. In addition, we remain strongly committed to creating social value and fostering an inclusive and diverse culture. Our efforts to strengthen relations with Indigenous Peoples in Canada and around the world have been recognized through our first certification as a Progressive Aboriginal Relations Bronze company.

Management outlook for fiscal year 2025 CAE confirms all of the 2025 guidance originally disclosed on May 21, 2024 , including for Civil and Defense, for finance expense and tax expense, and for balanced capital allocation priorities and accretive growth investments. CAE reiterates that a tenet of its capital management priorities includes the maintenance of a solid financial position, and it expects to continue to bolster its balance sheet through ongoing deleveraging, commensurate with its investment grade profile. Management's outlook for fiscal year 2025 and the targets outlined in CAE's May 21, 2024 press release ( https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo ) and expectations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and are based on a number of assumptions, including in relation to prevailing market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, supply chains and labor markets. As the basis of its fiscal 2025 outlook, management assumes no further disruptions to the global economy, air traffic, CAE's operations, and its ability to deliver products and services. Expectations are also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and based on assumptions about customer receptivity to CAE's training solutions and operational support solutions as well as material assumptions contained in this press release, quarterly Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and in CAE's fiscal 2024 MD&A, all available on our website ( www.cae.com ), SEDAR+ ( www.SEDARplus.ca ) and EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ).

Caution concerning forward-looking statements This press release includes forward-looking statements about our activities, events and developments that we expect to or anticipate may occur in the future including, for example, statements about our vision, strategies, market trends and outlook, future revenues, earnings, cash flow growth, profit trends, growth capital spending, expansions and new initiatives, including initiatives that pertain to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, financial obligations, available liquidities, expected sales, general economic and political outlook, inflation trends, prospects and trends of an industry, expected annual recurring cost savings from operational excellence programs, our management of the supply chain, estimated addressable markets, demands for CAE's products and services, our access to capital resources, our financial position, the expected accretion in various financial metrics, the expected capital returns to shareholders, our business outlook, business opportunities, objectives, development, plans, growth strategies and other strategic priorities, and our competitive and leadership position in our markets, the expansion of our market shares, CAE's ability and preparedness to respond to demand for new technologies, the sustainability of our operations, our ability to retire the Legacy Contracts as expected and to manage and mitigate the risks associated therewith, the impact of the retirement of the Legacy Contracts, expected results from the re-baselining of the Defense business, management outlook for fiscal year 2025, the establishment of a NCIB program, the introduction of a shareholder dividend and other statements that are not historical facts. Since forward-looking statements and information relate to future events or future performance and reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events, they are typically identified by words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"likely\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"will\", \"strategy\", \"future\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. All such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of May 27, 2024 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after May 27, 2024.The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected fiscal 2025 financial results and in obtaining a better understanding of our anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Material assumptions The forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the prevailing market conditions, geopolitical instability, the customer receptivity to our training and operational support solutions, the accuracy of our estimates of addressable markets and market opportunity, the realization of anticipated annual recurring cost savings and other intended benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational excellence programs, the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressures and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased prices, the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs from global supply chain logistics challenges, the stability of foreign exchange rates, the ability to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the availability of borrowings to be drawn down under, and the utilization, of one or more of our senior credit agreements, our available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on our revolving credit facility, the balance available under our receivable purchase facility, the assumption that our cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future, access to expected capital resources within anticipated timeframes, no material financial, operational or competitive consequences from changes in regulations affecting our business, our ability to retain and attract new business, our ability to effectively execute and retire the Legacy Contracts while managing the risks associated therewith, and our ability to complete the integration of the AirCentre business and the separation of the CAE Healthcare business within the anticipated time periods and at the expected cost levels. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release and, consequently, the forward‐looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 available on our website ( www.cae.com ), SEDAR+ ( www.SEDARplus.ca ) and EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ).

We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income or loss Adjusted segment operating income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure that gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment's performance. We calculate adjusted segment operating income by taking operating income and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We track adjusted segment operating income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income on a consolidated basis is a total of segments measure since it is the profitability measure employed by management for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted segment operating income margin (or adjusted segment operating income as a % of revenue) Adjusted segment operating income margin is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing our adjusted segment operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted effective tax rate Adjusted effective tax rate is a supplementary financial measure that represents the effective tax rate on adjusted net income or loss. It is calculated by dividing our income tax expense by our earnings before income taxes, adjusting for the same items used to determine adjusted net income or loss. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of the impact of changes in income tax rates and the mix of income on our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted net income or loss Adjusted net income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results. We calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We track adjusted net income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted earnings or loss per share (EPS) Adjusted earnings or loss per share is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing adjusted net income or loss by the weighted average number of diluted shares. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance on a per share basis and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure which comprises net income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes, finance expense – net, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Free cash flow Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations. We use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity. We calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities, subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, intangible assets expenditures excluding capitalized development costs, other investing activities not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds, net of payments, from equity accounted investees. Cash conversion rate Cash conversion rate is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income. We use it to assess our performance in cash flow generation and as a basis for evaluating our capitalization structure. Liquidity and Capital Structure measures Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) Adjusted ROCE is a non-IFRS ratio calculated over a rolling four-quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations adjusting for net finance expense, after tax, restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events divided by the average capital employed from continuing operations. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We use adjusted ROCE to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital. Net debt Net debt is a capital management measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS ratio calculated as net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. We use it because it reflects our ability to service our debt obligations. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our ability to service our debt obligations. Maintenance and growth capital expenditures Maintenance capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity. Growth capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity. The sum of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures represents our total property, plant and equipment expenditures. Growth measures Adjusted order intake Adjusted order intake is a supplementary financial measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received: For the Civil Aviation segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Additionally, expected future revenues from customers under short-term and long-term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees, or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated; For the Defense and Security segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Defense and Security contracts are usually executed over a long-term period but some of them must be renewed each year. For this segment, we only include a contract item in adjusted order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it. Adjusted backlog Adjusted backlog is a supplementary financial measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog, joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options: Obligated backlog represents the value of our adjusted order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the adjusted order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year, subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments. If the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified, the backlog is revised through adjustments; Joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed. Joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above; Unfunded backlog represents legally binding Defense and Security orders with the U.S. government that we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained. The uncertainty relates to the timing of the funding authorization, which is influenced by the government's budget cycle, based on a September year-end. Options are included in adjusted backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised, which we define as at least 80% probable, but multi-award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts are excluded. When an option is exercised, it is considered adjusted order intake in that period, and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options. Book-to-sales ratio The book-to-sales ratio is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing adjusted order intake by revenue in a given period. We use it to monitor the level of future growth of the business over time. Supplementary non-financial information definitions Full-flight simulators (FFSs) in CAE's network A FFS is a full-size replica of a specific make, model and series of an aircraft cockpit, including a motion system. In our count of FFSs in the network, we generally only include FFSs that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices, or other lower-level devices, as these are typically used in addition to FFSs in the same approved training programs. Simulator equivalent unit (SEU) SEU is a measure we use to show the total average number of FFSs available to generate earnings during the period. For example, in the case of a 50/50 flight training joint venture, we will report only 50% of the FFSs under this joint venture as a SEU. If a FFS is being powered down and relocated, it will not be included as a SEU until the FFS is re-installed and available to generate earnings. Utilization rate Utilization rate is a measure we use to assess the performance of our Civil simulator training network. While utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized, we track it, together with other measures, because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance. We calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period.

        "content": "Come the start of the 2025/26 school year, West Kelowna will have an additional 165 spaces for students. The province announced $10.5 million in funding to build seven new classrooms at Chief Tomat Elementary. “To support the rapid growth of the Central Okanagan, the board of education prioritizes advocating for funding of classroom space and we appreciate this investment in our learners,” said Lee-Ann Tiede, Chair for the Central Okanagan Board of Education. “We look forward to continuing to work together to meet the needs of students and families in our growing district.” The announcement was made at North Glenmore Elementary. Construction is well underway to open five new prefabricated classrooms in the fall. The province approved more than $180 million to create 2,385 new student seats in the Central Okanagan School District over the past six years. This includes the 12-classroom addition at École Dr. Knox Middle School underway, the completed École H.S. Grenda Middle and funding for the new George Pringle Secondary. Since September 2017, the provincial government has provided over $4 billion for new schools, upgrades, and land purchases for future schools to be built. READ MORE:",

        "content": "Nebraska coach Will Bolt is doused with Gatorade after the Huskers won the Big Ten Tournament championship on Sunday at Schwab Field. Will Bolt didn’t see it coming. The fifth-year Nebraska skipper was in the middle of his postgame Big Ten Network interview. He was mid-sentence, thanking Husker fans for packing the Chuck despite them having to change their plans with little advance notice thanks to the threat of impending weather forcing the conference to move the Big Ten Championship game up several hours. “Short notice, showing up,” Bolt said before pausing. The pause came for a good reason, as seniors Cole Evans and Ben Columbus snuck up behind their coach to give him a frigid, ice-filled Gatorade bucket bath. Bolt took it like a champ, almost instantaneously raising his arms in celebration before hugging the two. “As I was saying, thanks Husker Nation for showing up today,” Bolt continued. “It was the difference in the baseball game. Appreciate you guys.” The on-field celebration was a special one. The first conference tournament victory for Nebraska since 2005. Ah, yes, 2005. We all remember 2005. We won’t compare this to that. But, man, this was sure special, too. To go from being run-ruled in the first game of the tournament to fighting through the elimination bracket to win the whole dang thing? Doesn’t happen much. Not since Ohio State in 1995 for the Big Ten’s tourney. What a run. What a magical, magical run. But it isn’t stopping here. Nebraska (39-20) learned Monday that it’ll be traveling to Stillwater this weekend to face Florida (28-27) in the first game of the Regionals. How does Nebraska turn the page? Especially after an emotional week like last week? Well, they’ve had practice. Winning an extra-innings game against Northwestern to sweep on a Sunday. Lose to Creighton on a Tuesday. Beat Ohio State on a Friday. Or, lose to Creighton on a Tuesday. Beat Kansas State the next day. Or, lose to South Dakota State on a Wednesday. Win an extra-innings game against Indiana on Saturday. Or, get run-ruled by Ohio State to kick off the Big Ten Tournament and then win the next five games to win the tourney. “We’ve really challenged our guys to not be emotionally driven,” Bolt said after the NCAA selection show. “It’s intentional. It’s not easy to do, but if you do it day after day, it gives you a better chance to do it. And this team’s been doing it for almost 10 months now. So it’s been impressive.” Some other thoughts connected to Nebraska’s postseason: Florida, somehow, snuck into the field after going 13-17 in SEC play. But again, remember... the Gators are in the SEC. The schedule they had was brutal, and led to 13 Quad 1 victories. The Gators are No. 30 in RPI compared to Nebraska's No. 28. Despite Florida's on-paper record, the Gators have some star power that could create some magic if left unchecked in Jac Caglianone. The senior two-way lefty's resume is long. He once again earned first-team SEC honors for his efforts at first base, on the mound and at the dish. Before Florida's early exit in the SEC tournament, Caglianone ranked third nationally in home runs, fifth in slugging percentage, eighth in batting average and 11th in on-base percentage. Not too shabby. Curious to see how Nebraska game plans for one of the top college prospects for this year's MLB draft. It was hard not to get misty-eyed listening to the final out call on the Husker Radio Network on Sunday. Greg Sharpe sounded sharp as ever, despite his ongoing cancer treatment. “Gabe Swansen is there. He squeezes it. And your Huskers are Big Ten champions. After losing game one Tuesday night, they come back and win five straight and capture the Big Ten Tournament for the first time since joining the league.” Typing it out gave me chills. For so many reasons. But primarily because it’s Sharpe’s voice delivering that moment. If you haven’t gone back and listened to it, you should. How the baseball team has rallied around him this season since his diagnosis has been special to see. The patches on the hats. The jersey they presented him with a few weeks back. Then for him to be there yesterday when Nebraska won it? Yeah, tears were shed by many who took in that moment. “That was emotional,” Bolt said. “After the game, he came down. He had some tears and I did as well. I’ve gotten to grow pretty close with Greg for the last few years. He’s fighting a fight that, it’s a battle. It’s tough. It’s taken a toll on him and I’m sure his family. When we found out and told the team about it, we said, ‘Let’s dedicate the rest of the season to Sharpie.’” Love it. Wouldn’t expect anything less. Unlike football coach Matt Rhule and basketball coaches Fred Hoiberg and Amy Williams, the bonuses Bolt has earned are based on his base salary rather than a fixed number. Bolt, who makes $400,000 annually, earned two bonuses with Nebraska’s Big Ten Tournament championship and the postseason berth. Winning a Big Ten championship — in either the regular season or the tournament, but not both — comes with a 15% bonus. In Bolt’s case, that equates to $60,000. As far as the postseason is concerned, Bolt earns a minimum bonus of 5% — or $20,000 — for making the postseason. But if Nebraska advances farther, Bolt could earn more. If Nebraska baseball makes the “top 16” — aka Super Regionals — Bolt would earn a 10% bonus. That’s $40,000. If Nebraska baseball advances to the “top 8” — aka the College World Series — Bolt would earn a 20% bonus. That’s $80,000. And in the event Nebraska baseball were to win the CWS for the first time in program history, that’s a 25% bonus. For Bolt, that would be $100,000. Bolt is owed those bonuses “no later than 90 days following the last possible event which is the basis for the award.” Nebraska played five of the other teams in the NCAA Tournament field and went 11-3 in those games. Nebraska lost to Oklahoma in the second game of the season, losing 7-6 at Globe Life Field. Nebraska went 3-1 against Grand Canyon back in February. The results of those games: a 7-2 win, an 11-1 win, a 7-5 loss and a 10-8 win. Nebraska swept Nicholls State with wins of 7-6, 16-0 and 11-4. Nebraska’s first game against Kansas State was scrapped due to weather, but Nebraska won the second matchup on May Day, 8-0. Nebraska won the series against Indiana two weeks ago, dropping the first one 10-5 before bouncing back to win the second game, 5-2, in extra innings and the rubber match, 4-2. Nebraska played Indiana again on Saturday in the Big Ten Tournament, winning twice, 4-2 and 10-4.

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.",

Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "description": "Former Manawatū and Waikato winger Newton Tudreu was a standout for Hamilton Marist.",
        "content": "With another weekend of Waikato Club Rugby in the can, for some premier sides their hopes of qualifying in the top five for the Breweries Shield are at an end. Meanwhile, the new turf at Hamilton Marist was a massive success, with rugby all day wrapped up with a quality Premier top-of-the-table clash. It was heartache again for the Pirongia Colts with another tight loss, while the Melville women’s team lead in the Waitomo Group Women’s Premiership was cut to one point. Waikato Draught Men’s Premiership The much-anticipated top-of-the-table matchup between Hamilton Marist and Ōtorohanga headlined a huge weekend of Premiership rugby. It was put on ice for just over an hour because of a serious injury from the prior Premier B match, but when it got under way the newly installed LED lights were working a treat with a good buzz around the ground. Hamilton Marist got out to an early lead with tries to Fletcher Morgan and Liam Gilheany-Black, who barged over from short range to go up 14-0 after 15 minutes. Ōtorohanga responded soon after through a penalty kick to second five-eighths Hamish Clapcott. An error off the resulting kick-off saw Hamilton Marist have a midfield scrum to the left of the posts 22m out. Winger Newton Tudreu receiving a flat ball from halfback Keaton Neels and some weak defence in the Ōtorohanga backline saw Tudreu touch down for his first of two tries. Marist’s lead was 21-3 after 20 minutes. Ōtorohanga maintained some possession and crossed in the left corner through centre Hutana Coffin to make it 21-8 but a try just before the halftime break made it 28-8 to Hamilton Marist. It was a big task for the Ōtorohanga men to come back from in the second forty. The second half proved to be a much tighter match-up, with Hamilton Marist adding only three more points, from the boot of Morgan, while Ōtorohanga’s Murray Iti dotted down to add to his season tally. Hamilton Marist won 31-13. The other big match-up was at the University of Waikato earlier in the afternoon. Te Awamutu Sports were looking to break a wretched run of defeats, while the students have been the form side recently and a win ensured top-five Premiership status in round two. In a typical back-and-forth match-up on what was Varstonians Day at the University, it was the home side who got up 30-24 versus Te Awamutu Sports. A double to University winger Joshua Brunger highlighted the scoring for the home side in their five-tries-to-four home win. It was a lower-scoring affair in Morrinsville, where Fraser Tech got up 17-13 to record their third win of the year, while big wins at home went to Hamilton Old Boys and Hautapu respectively. Hautapu won 54-7 at home versus Melville, pushing Hautapu up into second on the ladder over Ōtorohanga, while Hamilton Old Boys’ 57-7 win at home over United Matamata Sports keeps their top five aspirations alive, jumping past Melville into fifth spot on the ladder heading into the last week of the first round. This weekend it comes down to two sides to make up that fifth spot in the top five. Hamilton Old Boys - currently fifth - host Ōtorohanga at Fred Jones Park, while Melville, currently sixth, host University at Collins Rd. A win to Old Boys will put them in the fifth spot, but a loss to Ōtorohanga will mean they’ll need University to beat Melville. A Melville win with an Old Boys loss will put the Collins Rd men into the top five in what would be a massive turnaround in form from last year, when they held their Premier status via a promotion/relegation play-off win. Waitomo Group Women’s Premiership and Championship Hamilton Old Boys’ Huskiez hosted Ōtorohanga at Willoughby Park, both sides comfortably in the top four but chasing Melville at the top of the table. A win to Ōtorohanga would have seen them jump Melville into the top spot while the Huskiez needed the bonus point to draw level. Tries to Ana Marsters and Tafiau Fetalaiga and a conversion and penalty kick to Yu Sato were enough for the home side to get up and win 15-0 over the travelling Ōtorohanga ladies. The other Premiership match-up was University hosting Kihikihi at the University. The home side ran in eight tries with a hattrick to Chelsea Semple, playing in her 50th match for University, the pick of the try scorers. The championship got under way on Thursday evening when Putāruru hosted United Matamata Sports in a catch-up match-up from round seven. Putāruru ran away with a 33-0 win at home to put them on top of the championship ladder. In a tight match-up, third-placed Hautapu travelled north to Murphy Lane to take on fourth-placed Taupiri. Nine tries were scored in the afternoon, providing plenty of entertainment for the faithful supporters, who saw the home side win 31-26 and jump into the third spot on the ladder. Hautapu slip down to fourth. The other match-up saw Suburbs win at home 53-0, scoring nine tries and holding a perfect clean sheet on defence for their third consecutive match. Division One Division One threw up some tight affairs across several matches on Saturday afternoon. Hinuera reclaim top-of-the-table bragging rights for a week with a tight 19-14 win at home over Ōhaupō – their second consecutive win at home by less than five points. Leamington travelled down to Tokoroa to take on Southern United and a true Leamington versus SURF match-up was delivered. The home side snuck home 24-23 and jumped to second on the ladder over Suburbs, who won at home versus Putāruru 26-21. All three sides are within four points of each other on the ladder, each losing only one game throughout the season. Hinuera will have the bye this weekend so Suburbs and Southern United could overtake them on the ladder, displacing them from the top spot. Elsewhere, Te Rapa won at home over Kereone, 27-7. Each week the Morrinsville-based side edge closer to that first elusive win back in Division One, which could come this weekend when they host fellow strugglers Frankton, who lost 101-0 to Taupiri at Murphy Lane. Colts For the second consecutive week, the young men from Pirongia have experienced heartache in defeat – this time going down to University 23-22 in Hamilton on Saturday afternoon. The difference between the two was the boot of University’s Benjamin Hedley, who kicked the penalty goal which ultimately was the difference between the sides, who each scored four tries and were unsuccessful in all eight conversion attempts. Leamington hosted Morrinsville Sports in Cambridge and picked up a tight 29-27 win at home, their third win of the season. They now sit just behind Morrinsville on the ladder. Top side Hamilton Marist headed out to Hinuera but their 21-5 win was not enough to maintain the top spot over Hautapu, who won by default versus United Matamata Sports. The three tries in Hinuera for Hamilton Marist weren’t enough to pick up the bonus point and they dropped to second place on the ladder behind Hautapu with three rounds remaining. In other results, Suburbs won 52-5 at home over Fraser Tech and Hamilton Old Boys won 31-17 over Thames Valley United. Under 85kg Morrinsville Sports kept their perfect season alive with a 12-8 win over Hamilton Marist at Campbell Park. Tries to Sam Fitness and Jakob McClelland were enough for the home side to beat Hamilton Marist, who are in a three-way battle for second place with Melville and Fraser Tech. The defeat sees Marist drop to fourth, three points behind second-placed Fraser Tech and two points behind third-placed Melville. Melville travelled to Leamington and won 44-14, running in eight tries to two, whileFraser Tech headed south and won 31-10 against Kio Kio. In a big match-up this coming weekend, Fraser Tech will host Morrinsville Sports in Hamilton in a one-versus-two match-up, while Melville will host Kio Kio and Hamilton Marist host Leamington.

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" People are also reading... Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. Photos: Remembering Lisa Marie Presley, 1968-2023 \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek made a winning start in her bid for a fourth title French Open in Paris on Monday. The women’s world number one raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. The Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka tomorrow. “I’m really happy to be back. Feel like I’m playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,” said Swiatek. The 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year. Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks. The Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet. “The hip is good, I’m very happy,” said Sinner. Former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1. Women’s third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1. The 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32. Marketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets. Tunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery. Later, American Ben Shelton won his first match at the French Open as he overcame Frenchman Hugo Gaston 3-6, 6-3 ,6-4 6-4, not only surviving two interruptions from the Paris rain but also the wrath of the local fans. Loud chants of “Hugo, Hugo” echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton’s fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter. Shelton will play Kei Nishikori, who beat Gabriel Diallo 7-5 7-6(3) 3-6 1-6 7-5, in the second round.

The Corporation is preparing to drill the Cardamomo-1 exploration well located in the northern part of its 100% operated VIM-5 Exploration and Production (\"E&P\") contract situated approximately 25 kilometers to the north of its Jobo gas processing facility. The Cardamomo-1 exploration well will target potential gas bearing sands within the Cienaga de Oro (\"CDO\") reservoir, in a large well defined structural closure identified on the Redoblante 3D seismic survey acquired in 2023. Similar to all of the other large discoveries the Corporation has made in the past, including the Clarinete, Nelson, Aguas Vivas, and Pandereta gas fields, the Cardamomo prospect exhibits a well-defined AVO attribute, a seismic characteristic commonly associated with the presence of gas within the CDO reservoir. The Corporation plans to spud the well in late July 2024, and anticipates that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to drill and complete the well. Given success, the Cardamomo field will be tied into the Alboka flowline located approximately 12 kilometers to the south. The Cardamomo prospect is one of 14 CDO exploration prospects identified on the newly acquired Redoblante 3D seismic survey, and should it prove successful will open up a new productive gas area for the Corporation within the northern part of the VIM-5 E&P contract. About Canacol Canacol is a natural gas exploration and production company with operations focused in Colombia. The Corporation's common stock trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the OTCQX in the United States of America, and the Colombia Stock Exchange under ticker symbol CNE, CNNEF, and CNEC, respectively.

        "description": "A new Waco nonprofit is hosting a free \"Protect Yourself!\" conference to teach the elderly and their caregivers about ways to protect older adults from scams, fraud and abuse.",
        "content": "A new local nonprofit is inviting the public to a June 7 conference to teach senior adults and their caregivers how to protect against scams, fraud and abuse. The free \"Protect Yourself!\" conference, organized by Better at Last , will feature more than 20 speakers at the Waco Convention Center. The conference comes at a time when scams targeting the elderly are on the rise, according to a 2023 report from the FBI. Better at Last founder Teresa Gingles is a physical therapist and board-certified geriatric specialist with Baylor Scott & White who has been working with older adults for more than a decade. She started working on the nonprofit about 18 months ago. Teresa Gingles, founder of the local nonprofit Better at Last, is a physical therapist and a board certified geriatrics specialist. After hosting various workshops with help from a $10,000 Texas Bar Foundation grant, Gingles decided to organize a conference on elder fraud. She said the event is important because older adults are often the victims of scams but may not know how to protect themselves. \"We need to get these older adults in front of experts,\" she said. \"This problem is certainly not going away.\" The conference will feature two keynote speakers. Patrick Swanton, a retired sergeant from the Waco Police Department, and Sandy Sullivan, a retired senior vice president of fraud for Frost Bank, will both give speeches on the prevalence of fraud. Following the keynote speakers, attendees can choose to participate in three breakout sessions of their choice and various panel discussions featuring speakers from across the state, including from banks, law enforcement, Baylor Law School, law firms and the Texas Bankers Association. Among other topics, speakers will discuss basic bank security protections, rights of the elderly, when to report a scam, the most common types of fraud and how to vet potential scammers. Gingles said she felt passionate about hosting the conference because, like many people, an elderly relative in her family was affected by a scam. According to the FBI, older Americans are disproportionately affected by fraud. Scams targeting individuals aged 60 and older increased by 14% in 2023 compared to the previous year. More than 101,000 seniors age 60 or older reported being victimized by scams last year and the FBI estimates these crimes caused over $3.4 billion in losses. There are many types of scams, but tech support scams were the most widely reported type of elder fraud last year. Personal data breaches, confidence and romance scams, non-payment or non-delivery scams and investment scams were the other top four most common types of elder fraud reported. As for the most costly type of scams, investment scams were the costliest kind of elder fraud last year, with victims reporting more than $1.2 billion in losses. Cryptocurrency was also an increasing medium or tool used to facilitate scams targeting the elderly. More than 12,000 victims aged 60 or older reported cryptocurrency as a factor in the scam or fraud that targeted them. According to the United States Credit Union , older citizens are attractive to con artists because they often have a \"nest egg\", own their home or have excellent credit. Scammers may also exploit typical cultural norms held by older Americans, such as being polite or trusting, which makes it harder for them to say no or hang up the phone. Older adults are also less likely to report fraud because they either don't know who to report it to, are embarrassed about being scammed or don't know they've been scammed. Even when elder victims report scams, they may not be good witnesses due to the effects of age on memory. Gingles said the conference is just one part of her nonprofit's greater mission to improve the lives of older adults. \"The goal is getting people strong and active, connected and protected,\" she said. The conference will be held from 8 a.m. to noon and is free for adults ages 55 and older, as well as their caregivers. All attendees must register for the event on the Better at Last website .

        "description": "Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces",
        "content": "It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. “ When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Manitoba . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.”",

        "description": "Despite its recent sharp gains, Enbridge (TSX:ENB) stock has the potential to continue inching up in the years to come and reward investors with higher dividends.The post Where Will Enbridge Stock Be in 3 Years? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "After declining by nearly 10% in 2023, ( ) stock seems to be regaining strength in recent months. ENB stock has gone up by more than 12% over the last seven months to currently trade at $49.53 per share with a of $104.8 billion. At this market price, it offers an impressive 7.4% annualized dividend yield and distributes these dividend payouts every quarter. But can Enbridge continue to deliver strong returns to investors in the years ahead? Before discussing where the stock might stand three years from now by looking at the factors that are likely to influence Enbridge’s future performance, let’s first review the drivers of its recent recovery. Key factors helping Enbridge stock recover The main reason for Enbridge stock’s recent recovery could be the resilience of its core business, which consists of transporting and storing crude oil and natural gas across North America. Despite the challenges posed by warmer weather and largely weaker commodity prices in recent quarters, the company is continuing to maintain positive earnings growth, robust cash flows, and dividends. In the first quarter of 2024, Enbridge’s total revenue 8.6% YoY (year over year) to around $11 billion as significantly warmer weather affected the performance of its gas distribution and storage segment. Nevertheless, despite this negative factor, along with higher operating costs, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings jumped by 8.2% YoY to $0.92 per share, beating Street analysts’ expectations of $0.81 per share. Similarly, its adjusted net profit margin expanded to 17.7% in the latest quarter from 14.3% a year ago. These positive factors might have supported a recovery in Enbridge’s stock price in recent months, as investors might have appreciated its strong earnings potential despite unfavourable market conditions. Where will Enbridge stock be in three years? Besides continued strength in its core energy transportation business, Enbridge, in recent years, has increased its focus on further diversifying its revenue stream. This is one of the key reasons why the company is investing in segments like crude oil export and renewable energy. Also, its strong cash flows and robust financial position give it the ability to invest in future growth. For example, in the first quarter, Enbridge completed the acquisition of The East Ohio Gas Company (known as Enbridge Gas Ohio now) in a deal worth US$6.6 billion, which is expected to improve its position in the gas distribution market and help it accelerate financial growth trends. While it’s nearly impossible for anyone to accurately predict where Enbridge stock will be three years from now, its strong and diverse revenue streams indicate that it has a bright future ahead, which can help its share prices continue soaring in the coming years. That said, if you expect to multiply your invested money in a short period of time, ENB stock might not be the best option for you. However, if you are looking for a long-term investment that can provide you with a steady dividend income and capital appreciation, then you might want to consider adding Enbridge stock to your portfolio. Also, the fact that it has a solid track record of increasing its dividends for 29 consecutive years makes it even more appealing for long-term income investors.",

I support all these initiatives 100% and frankly it’s about time we had some common sense in our province. I’m absolutely thrilled (B.C.

        "content": "I've already bought the two cheap in this article. They're wonderful picks for in . The higher environment is harming some sectors more than others. Within the pain, I think there are a few opportunities on the ASX. And I'd much rather buy undervalued businesses than, say, the ( ), which, based on its and , is one of the most expensive banks in the world. So, if I were investing in companies because of the and value on offer, the below two would be among the names at the top of my buy list. Metcash Ltd ( ) Metcash is a diversified business with three core segments. It supplies independent supermarkets around Australia, namely IGAs. The company also supplies independent liquor retailers, including IGA Liquor, Bottle-O, Cellarbrations, and Porters Liquor. The food and liquor divisions can, in my opinion, provide stable earnings because of the largely consistent demand by households. I'm excited about the company's hardware division, which includes Total Tools, Mitre 10, and Home Timber & Hardware. Hardware earnings are currently facing headwinds amid the high cost-of-living environment households and builders are in. I think Metcash can return to good earnings growth when economic conditions improve. I like the company's recent move to and a food service business that supplies other businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, hotels, hospitals, and others. The ASX dividend share has committed to a of 70% of underlying , which means it can pay a relatively high dividend yield. According to the estimates on Commsec, Metcash could pay a grossed-up dividend yield of 7.7% in FY24. It looks cheap to me because it's trading at just 13x FY24's estimated earnings, whereas peers like ( ) and ( ) are trading at higher earnings multiples. Rural Funds Group ( ) Rural Funds is a cheap ASX dividend share, in my opinion, because the farmland is trading at a significant discount to its underlying . According to Rural Funds (and independent property valuers), the business had an adjusted NAV of $3.07 at . That means the current Rural Funds share price is at a discount of around 34% to the latest disclosed NAV. The business is seeing its rental income steadily grow thanks to rental indexation built into most of its contracts. Some of those rental increases are linked to , while other contracts have a fixed annual increase. Rural Funds has grown or maintained its distribution every year for the past decade. In the longer term, it wants to grow its annual distribution by 4% per annum. The business has good farmland diversification across cattle, almonds, macadamias, vineyards and cropping. is useful as a form of protection against risk, so not all the eggs are in one basket. Being open to investing in multiple farming sectors gives the business more opportunities. Its trailing distribution yield is 5.8%, which I believe is a solid starting yield for this cheap ASX dividend share.",

        "content": "Private daycares squeezed out by B.C. public programs Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces Xiao Xu, The Globe and Mail May 27, 2024 1:30 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. kali9/E+/Getty Images Listen to this article 00:09:54 It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. “ When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Manitoba . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.” See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "Lightspeed is a tech stock that is growing at an enviable pace. But this TSX growth stock is a much better buy. The post A Growth Stock I’d Buy Over Lightspeed in 2024 appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "While have staged a remarkable comeback since the bear market of 2022, ( ) continues to trail the broader indices. Most equity indices, such as the S&P 500 and TSX 60, are trading near all-time highs, but LSPD stock is down 87% from record levels. Valued at a of US$2.32 billion, Lightspeed Commerce offers a fintech platform to small and medium enterprises, primarily in the restaurant industry. Lightspeed’s sales increased from US$221.7 million in fiscal 2021 (which ended in March) to US$909 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to acquisitions. The rapid expansion in the top line meant LSPD stock soared from $27 in May 2019 to over $160 in September 2021. However, a scathing report from Spruce Point, a noted short-seller, drove LSPD shares lower. In late September 2021, Spruce Point accused Lightspeed of inflating its total addressable market, customer counts, and gross transaction volume (GTV). Spruce Point claimed it found evidence that Lightspeed inflated its business pre-IPO (initial public offering) and overstated its customer count by 85% and GTV by 10%. The short-seller also stated, “We believe that Lightspeed’s recent acquisition spree has come at escalating costs with no clear path to profitability while management pursues aggressive revenue reporting practices.” Lightspeed Commerce is a beaten-down growth stock that is forecast to increase sales to US$1.1 billion in fiscal 2025 and to US$1.32 billion in 2026. An asset-light model should help Lightspeed improve profit margins significantly and benefit from operating leverage. The company is on track to improve earnings from US$0.16 per share in 2024 to US$0.34 per share in 2025 and US$0.53 per share in 2026. So, priced at 44.5 times , LSPD stock trades at a 20% discount to consensus price targets. However, I believe this is a much better buy at the current valuation. Let’s see why. While LSPD stock is down in the dumps, ( ) stock is up 283% in the last three years. Bombardier has increased its sales from $6 billion in 2021 to $8 billion in 2023. While it reported an operating loss of $269 million in 2021, it ended 2023 with an operating income of $8 billion. In the last two years, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) grew by a factor of more than four times to 15% in 2023. Its robust performance has put the company on track to end 2025 with sales of $9 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.625 billion, and free cash flow of $900 million. While Bombardier has $6 billion in debt, it aims to maintain a net leverage ratio of between 2 and 2.5 times. Moreover, a focus on cost optimization should help it end 2024 with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.72. Analysts expect EPS to surge by 58% to $9 per share in 2025, indicating the TSX stock is priced at less than 10 times forward earnings. Despite its sizeable returns since 2021, Bombardier stock should continue to outpace the broader markets, given its earnings forecasts.",

        "description": "Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces",
        "content": "It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.”",

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "The crowd claps to recognize those that served during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday, May 27, 2024, at Wyuka Cemetery. More than 100 attendees — including dozens of veterans and a handful of active service members — gathered near the center of Lincoln's largest cemetery on Memorial Day to honor and mourn the U.S. military personnel who died while serving in the armed forces. A crowd that included Blue Star Moms carrying wreaths and Girl Scouts with arms full of roses converged Monday morning on Wyuka Cemetery's G.A.R. Circle, sometimes called Soldiers Circle, to honor the generations of fallen servicemen and women buried there and elsewhere — and the thousands more still considered missing in action, having never returned home. At this annual celebration in a cemetery that is nearly as old as Lincoln itself, the fire department's Pipe and Drum corps led a brief foot parade to the Circle, where speakers took turns praying and venerating the fallen service members and their families, who also made a sacrifice worth remembering, said Greg Osborn, the co-chair of the Lincoln Memorial Day Observance Association, which spent months planning Monday's gathering. Lincoln Memorial Day Observance Association Co-Chair Greg Osborn speaks during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday, May 27, 2024, at Wyuka Cemetery. \"I want to thank the moms, the dads, the grandpas, the brothers, the sisters, spouses and everyone in their extended family — for sharing their family member with us to serve our country,\" Osborn told the crowd of at least 100, many of whom were clad in American flag apparel. \"Tell them as often as you can that they are loved. They matter. And what they did for us was vitally important,\" Osborn said, with a catch in his voice that reemerged throughout Monday's mournful ceremony. Retired Lt. Col. Robert Tobin (left) and Mary Hansen of the Military Order of the Purple Heart lay down wreaths during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday, May 27, 2024, at Wyuka Cemetery. Lt. Col. Tobin was wounded in Iraq in 2007 and Hansen's husband received a Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam. That message seemed tailormade for Linda Rotschafer, the wife of a veteran and mother of an airman who traces her family's military service back to the Revolutionary War and who sat in the front row of Monday's ceremony. \"It's one day in 365 that people recognize how important their veterans are,\" she said. \"It's very moving to see people do this much work.\" \"I mean, it takes all year to plan,\" said Kami Voboril, who sat beside Rotschafer and who had kicked off Monday's ceremony with a wreath casting honoring those lost at sea. \"Just to take part in stuff, I think that's the biggest thing. And to have younger — the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts — these younger kids that come and learn what it's about,\" said Voboril, who performed the wreath casting alongside 19-year-old Chloe Weber. \"Hopefully they'll carry it on after we're gone.\" Banks Williams, 2, walks through the headstones during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday, May 27, 2024, at Wyuka Cemetery. Williams' great grandparents Robert and Blanche served in the Air Force and Coast Guard, respectively. The procession followed the wreath casting, with the sound of pipes and drums that first erupted near the cemetery's historic horse stables and did not cease until the group — which included the firemen, a color guard and the American Legion, among others — reached the circle dotted by nearly identical granite markers displaying the name and, usually, the rank and regiment of the veteran buried underneath. Then came the National Anthem, the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer, led by Chaplain John Terpsma of the Lincoln-Lancaster Chaplaincy Corps, who thanked God for helping establish a nation of \"freedom, liberty and justice\" — the cost of which marked the purpose of Memorial Day. \"This freedom has come with a great cost, a cost of many lives who gave their all,\" Terpsma said. \"We gather today to remember our brave and courageous men and women of our armed forces who gave so much to ensure that our freedom continues. \"We confess to you, God, that we forget these mighty soldiers and what they gave to ensure our freedom. We pray that you will help us to remember them.\" Dominic Holmes, 12, carries the American flag from 1818 during a Boy Scout Troop 456 flag presentation for the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday, May 27, 2024, at Wyuka Cemetery. For more than an hour Monday, those who congregated at Wyuka were flush with reminders: the U.S. Armed Forces Medley played over loud speakers as the American flag flew at half staff. Miniature flags, meanwhile, accompanied every grave marker in G.A.R. Circle, where the Girls Scouts later laid a rose beside each headstone. Members of the Lincoln Fire & Rescue Pipe & Drum lead the procession to the Grand Army of the Republic Circle during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday at Wyuka Cemetery. Eric Brackenburg, the commander of Shiloh Camp, the Lincoln chapter of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, read a 156-year-old order from Gen. John A. Logan of the Grand Army of the Republic, who in 1868 designated May 30 as Decoration Day. The general, in his order, declared the holiday \"for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard in the land,\" read Brackenburg, whose great-great-grandfather is buried in G.A.R.

More than 150 years later — long after Declaration Day became widely known as Memorial Day in the early 1900s, formalized by Congress in 1971 — Americans and Nebraskans \"continue to honor those left behind, who paid a personal price for us and our nation,\" said. Col. Thaddeus Fineran, the chief of staff of Nebraska's Army National Guard, who delivered keynote remarks at Monday's ceremony. Fineran thanked the state's Gold Star families — those who have lost an immediate family member in the line of active duty — and recounted the story of two men who were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in the D-Day operation of June 6, 1944, when Allied forces invaded Normandy during World War II. \"Today, our eyes are upon them as we remember the sacrifices America's children, siblings, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents have made and will continue to make for this country,\" Fineran said, later adding: \"We remember what they gave for us and we honor them today.\" Download the new Journal Star News Mobile App Wyuka Cemetery is the largest all-faith cemetery in Lincoln.

        "description": "Three teens swam in the Olympic Trials Junior Finals",
        "content": "Three Campbell River teenagers tested their swimming skills during Olympic Trials in Toronto from May 14 to May 19. “CRKW (Campbell River Killer Whales) and I are incredibly proud of the local athletes and their accomplishments at [the] Olympic Trials this past weekend. It is incredibly inspiring for our young swimmers and for the rest of our club to know there is a brilliant path in front of them,” says Mercedes Hayduk, president of the club. “The credit goes to our amazing head coach who works passionately and tirelessly with our swimmers to create an environment where champions are inevitable.” The three swimmers were Zac Millns, Sarah Haugen, and Keyana Owens. Haugen says the trials went great. “It was very interesting, very exciting and a good environment,” she says. “It was good to race at that level.” She qualified for the 100-metre breaststroke but admits it wasn’t her best time. She also did a couple of races in the 100-metre freestyle and was able to qualify for an Olympic trial time. “It was mostly a really nice visual of what my next four years (and) what I have to work up to. I didn’t place too well, which is fine, but it is more for the experience. Next year I plan on having at least five races at the trials and hopefully final in some of them (the junior finals).” She talked about using that as a platform to advance into the ‘B’ and ‘A’ finals. Richard Millns is the club’s head coach and is also Zac’s father. “As a head coach, I am very proud of all three of these swimmers. I have coached them since they were very little and am proud to see them bloom into the champions I always knew they could be,” says Millns. “As a father, I am so overjoyed to see my son compete at the Olympic Trials. He makes me a proud dad no matter what level he competes at, but it is nice to see him at the highest level.” Millns says the three teens finished in the middle of the pack. His 15-year-old son nearly qualified for the Junior Championship Final. To qualify for the trials, the swimmers needed to break club records and perform at “historically high levels” to represent the Campbell River community. The three teens are preparing to compete at the Far Western Championships in California (Owens and seven other CRKW members) and an international age-group competition in Spain (Millns and Haugen). “We’re going to race in Barcelona with a close friend who was a foreign exchange student a couple of years ago,” says Haugen. “It’s a real competition, it’s like a western-level meet, so that’s faster than Provincials, a little slower than trials.”",

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: ) (TSX: CAE) – CAE Inc. today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing and ending . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (\" \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value.

Here’s How to Get In.It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million. Do this now.",
        "content": "Finding high-growth investment opportunities in the middle of volatile markets is like finding gold. These days, three exceptional businesses have surfaced, all displaying eye-catching numbers and bright futures that attract the attention of astute investors throughout the globe. To begin with, the first one stands out due to its incredible financial boost. With an impressive yearly increase and quarterly boost in adjusted EBITDA, the business demonstrates solid cost control and operational efficiency. Moreover, the second one is very noticeable in the field of online shopping. The company’s marketplace shows a rising interaction and transactional value ecosystem, with a noteworthy growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) that third-party (3P) sellers mainly drive. This emerging market highlights the company’s flexibility and scalability in the digital sphere and offers steady development prospects. Finally, the third one stands out as a shining example of growth and financial stability. Supported by a solid increase in EPS and a discernible improvement in operating margins, the firm exhibits improved profitability and efficient cost control. Nextracker (NXT) The revenue of Nextracker (NASDAQ: NXT ) has uplifted massively on a quarterly and year-over-year (YoY) basis. The company’s sales for the fiscal 2024 were $2.5 billion , a solid boost of more than 30% YoY. The solid growth is further demonstrated by the Q4 revenue of $737 million, a 42% YoY increase. With that, Nextracker may continue to hit growth because of its steady revenue growth over the last quarter and fiscal year. This is the result of solid market demand and a progressive business strategy. Moreover, at $521 million, Nextracker’s adjusted EBITDA has more than doubled YoY—a remarkable 150% increase YoY. Adjusted EBITDA increased 120% YoY to $160 million in Q4 alone. Even without the IRA 45X tax credit benefits, this reflects excellent cost control and operational success. Additionally, Nextracker has had tremendous success abroad. Its Q4 income from overseas sales reached $242 million, an over 90% YoY increase. In addition, the business revealed a record backlog of over $4 billion , up more than 50% YoY and tripling over the preceding two years. Overall, based on completed contracts and purchase orders, this increasing backlog indicates solid future demand and improves revenue visibility, enabling long-term growth. GigaCloud (GCT) The GMV marketplace operated by GigaCloud (NASDAQ: GCT ) had a high 64% YoY boost , rising from $553.5 million to $908 million for the 12 months ended March 2024 (Q1 2024). This increase in GMV highlights the platform’s growing efficiency and scale for GigaCloud. Even more significantly, the GMV from third-party (3P) vendors increased, rising from $285 million to $490 million in the previous year’s period, a 71.8% increase. Moreover, the percentage of GMV attributed to 3P sellers has increased from 51.5% to 54%, indicating these sellers’ growing significance and input to GigaCloud’s marketplace. In short, the growth reflects an expanding marketplace ecosystem with increased engagement and transaction values. Additionally, sales increased 43.7% YoY from 602 to 865 active 3P vendors in Q1 2024. At the same time, there were 5,493 active purchasers , up from 4,255, a 29.1% YoY increase. Notably, the average spend per active buyer increased by 27%, from $130K to $165K. Therefore, these indicators suggest that the GigaCloud marketplace ecosystem is robust and expanding, with consumers and providers exhibiting increasing transaction values and increased involvement. Celestica (CLS) Celestica (NYSE: CLS ) derives a healthy profit as Q1 2024’s adjusted EPS increased to $0.86 from $0.47 in Q1 2023. This astounding 83% growth suggests increased profitability and efficient cost control. The non-IFRS operating margin for Celestica increased from 5.2% in Q1 2023 to 6.2% in Q1 2024. This 1% increase was fueled by an uplifted bottom line in the Advanced Technology Solutions ( ATS ) and Communications and Enterprise Solutions ( CCS ) divisions. This is the first time the quarterly non-IFRS operating margin has surpassed 6%. Additionally, revenue for the CCS segment increased from $1.04 billion to $1.44 billion , a 38% increase YoY. Currently, this market sector derives 65% of the company’s consolidated top-line. Moreover, the sector margin increased by 1.2%, from 5.8% to 7%. Notably, the solid demand from hyperscale clients, especially AI computing solutions, drives growth. Revenues for the ATS segment decreased by 3% YoY to $768 million, but the segment margin rose by 0.3% to 4.7% , demonstrating effective operations despite a challenging market. Finally, declines in industrial demand were countered by growth in the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector and a stable capital equipment business.

        "content": "Premier Doug Ford is considering an early election call before the scheduled 2026 vote over concerns about cuts a future federal Conservative government might impose, the Star has learned. Sources say Ford is worried that if, , Pierre Poilievre wins an election expected in October 2025, there would be to the provinces, a of that is a and other slashed spending that would hurt the Progressive Conservatives. That’s a major reason why the premier is paying The Beer Store $225 million to liberalize booze sales as of this fall — more than one year earlier than planned — in a deal critics warn could actually cost taxpayers between $600 million and $1 billion. At , Ford repeatedly refused to commit to the planned June 2026 election and left open the possibility of a snap vote, which could cost more than $155 million, this fall or next spring. “I just want to get our agenda through,” the premier told reporters, noting the expansion of beer sales was long-standing PC campaign promise. But Tory insiders, speaking confidentially in order to discuss ongoing internal deliberations, say Ford was giving himself options at a time when and enjoys a big poll lead over Bonnie Crombie’s Liberals and Marit Stiles’s New Democrats. “It’s smart. It gets us in front of a tough budget from Pierre that could hurt the Conservative brand and help Bonnie,” said one insider, who is bullish on the plan. Another said it would force the Tory caucus to focus on priorities like delivering on , such as improved highways, public transit and hospital construction. “We have to show results and (booze liberalization) is something we promised to deliver and the premier has done that,” said the second official. A third PC source conceded that an earlier than anticipated election could get the Tories ahead of any fallout from the ongoing RCMP criminal probe of the $8.28-billion land swap scandal. But some Tories fear a reprise of 1990 — when popular Liberal premier David Peterson called a snap vote, and then lost to Bob Rae’s New Democrats in one of the most stunning upsets in Canadian political history. “Peterson was higher in the polls (50 per cent in summer of 1990) than Ford ( ) is now and had won a larger majority (in 1987 than Ford did in 2022),” said a fourth Tory. “But voters were ornery and punished him for the early election.” A fifth Tory expressed alarm that voters would feel it was “cynical and self-serving” to have a vote so soon after Ford received such a resounding re-election mandate in June 2022. “What would the rationale be for going early?” asked the Ford loyalist. The premier’s inner circle is mindful of the potential perils — but also aware of provincial political history. According to what’s known as the ” ,” when Ontario voters elect , they tend to elect Tories provincially. Conversely, when they elect federal Tory governments, the Liberals — and, in one instance, the NDP — usually win provincially. That has been the case , so Ford’s team believes a Poilievre victory in October 2025 would most likely help Crombie’s Liberals in June 2026, which is why they may act pre-emptively. For his part, Peterson, now the chair of Torstar, parent company of the Toronto Star, was circumspect when asked Monday about the wisdom of Ford going to the polls early. “Every single situation is different — different players, different times and I’m in no position to judge,” said the former premier, who governed Ontario from 1985 to 1990. “If I was so smart, I’d still be there,” he joked. Still, some on Ford’s team are poring over “Not Without Cause,” the searing 1991 post-mortem book on Peterson’s gamble by former Liberal aides Georgette Gagnon and Dan Rath. The book — billed as “a cautionary take for voters and politicians everywhere” — chronicled the mounting anger voters felt over an early election that cost $40 million at the time. “Confident they knew what Ontarians were thinking in the summer of 1990, the Liberal strategists gave no thought to the possibility Peterson might actually be defeated in the election he was about to call,” wrote Gagnon and Rath. Elections Ontario said the 2022 election cost $145.3 million, which according to the Bank of Canada inflation calculator, is the equivalent of $155.8 million this year. Rivals charged Ford risks the wrath of voters if he holds an early vote for his own benefit. “The people of this province would see it for what it is, which is an attempt to divert and hide what’s coming or the RCMP criminal investigation, but I say also — bring it on,” said Stiles. Crombie said governments calling early elections are “typically punished” for wasting tens of millions of dollars. “We know what the lesson has been in the past. It would be very disrespectful to the taxpayer. They have a majority government,” she said, calling Ford’s liberalization push “a billion-dollar booze boondoggle.” Under Ontario’s election law, a premier does not have to abide by the fixed date every four years.",

        "description": "Financials unchanged from previously disclosed preliminary resultsMONTREAL, May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE:CAE) (TSX:CAE) - CAE Inc. (CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Financial results are unchanged from preliminary data that CAE disclosed on May 21, 2024, including the re-baselining of the Defense & Security business along with Defense & Security impairments and unfavourable contract adjustments related to eight previously identified fixed-price legacy contracts (the Legacy Contracts). All financial information is in Canadian dollars.\"Last week we acted decisively and took the necessary steps to provide a clear path to margin improvement in our Defense business, supported by compelling long-term secular trends for this segment,\" said Marc Parent, CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a result of the changes we have made, we have a more balanced risk profile going forward, and with Nick Leontidis as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), we are well-positioned to further strengthen our execution capabilities and drive additional synergies between our Civil and Defense segments.\"As previously disclosed, in Civil, the larger of CAE's two businesses, record margins and orders position the Company well in the fiscal year ahead with expected low double-digit percentage Civil annual adjusted segment operating income growth and continued margin strengthening, with an annual adjusted segment operating income margin of approximately 23%. For Defense, CAE continues to expect fiscal 2025 revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range and annual Defense adjusted segment operating income margin in the 6- to 7-percent range.As announced separately today, the TSX has approved the re-establishment of CAE's normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The NCIB will commence on May 30, 2024 and end on May 29, 2025. The decision of the Board of Directors to re-establish the NCIB reflects CAE's current outlook and the cash generative nature of its highly recurring revenue business. CAE's Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing a shareholder dividend.Consolidated resultsFourth quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was $1,126.3 million, compared with $1,197.4 million last year.

Additional information pertaining to Defense Legacy ContractsAs previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo.The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits.Additional financial detailsCAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of $55.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre).The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to $39.3 million, mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately $10 million of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on May 21, 2024, to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses.Net finance expense this quarter amounted to $52.4 million, compared to $52.4 million in the preceding quarter and $50.4 million in the fourth quarter last year.Income tax recovery this quarter was $80.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate(1), which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in Europe partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions.Net income from discontinued operations was $20.5 million this quarter compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $16.5 million in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business.Summary of results from discontinued operationsFY2024FY2023Q4-2024Q4-2023Revenue$ 131.7$ 192.7$ 14.8$ 59.1Expenses132.7184.720.050.8Operating (loss) income$ (1.0)$ 8.0$ (5.2)$ 8.3Finance expense3.64.10.61.0(Loss) earnings before income taxes$ (4.6)$ 3.9$ (5.8)$ 7.3Income tax (recovery) expense(9.4)1.8(9.8)2.5Net income from discontinued operations before after-taxgain on disposal$ 4.8$ 2.1$ 4.0$ 4.8After-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations16.5—16.5—Net income from discontinued operations$ 21.3$ 2.1$ 20.5$ 4.8Net cash provided by operating activities was $215.2 million for the quarter compared to $180.6 million in the fourth quarter last year.

(CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 . Financial results are unchanged from preliminary data that CAE disclosed on May 21, 2024 , including the re-baselining of the Defense & Security business along with Defense & Security impairments and unfavourable contract adjustments related to eight previously identified fixed-price legacy contracts (the Legacy Contracts). All financial information is in Canadian dollars. \"Last week we acted decisively and took the necessary steps to provide a clear path to margin improvement in our Defense business, supported by compelling long-term secular trends for this segment,\" said Marc Parent , CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a result of the changes we have made, we have a more balanced risk profile going forward, and with Nick Leontidis as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), we are well-positioned to further strengthen our execution capabilities and drive additional synergies between our Civil and Defense segments.\" As previously disclosed, in Civil, the larger of CAE's two businesses, record margins and orders position the Company well in the fiscal year ahead with expected low double-digit percentage Civil annual adjusted segment operating income growth and continued margin strengthening, with an annual adjusted segment operating income margin of approximately 23%. For Defense, CAE continues to expect fiscal 2025 revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range and annual Defense adjusted segment operating income margin in the 6- to 7-percent range. As announced separately today, the TSX has approved the re-establishment of CAE's normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The NCIB will commence on May 30, 2024 and end on May 29, 2025 . The decision of the Board of Directors to re-establish the NCIB reflects CAE's current outlook and the cash generative nature of its highly recurring revenue business. CAE's Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing a shareholder dividend.

Additional information pertaining to Defense Legacy Contracts As previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years https://www.cae.com/news-events/press-releases/cae-announces-re-baselining-of-its-defense-business-defense-impairments-accelerated-risk-recognition-on-legacy-contracts-and-appointment-of-nick-leontidis-as-coo . The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits. Additional financial details CAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of $55.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre). The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to $39.3 million , mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately $10 million of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on May 21, 2024 , to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses. Net finance expense this quarter amounted to $52.4 million , compared to $52.4 million in the preceding quarter and $50.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. Income tax recovery this quarter was $80.6 million , representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate (1) , which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in Europe partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions. Net income from discontinued operations was $20.5 million this quarter compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $16.5 million in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business. Summary of results from discontinued operations FY2024 FY2023 Q4-2024 Q4-2023 Revenue $ 131.7 $ 192.7 $ 14.8 $ 59.1 Expenses 132.7 184.7 20.0 50.8 Operating (loss) income $ (1.0) $ 8.0 $ (5.2) $ 8.3 Finance expense 3.6 4.1 0.6 1.0 (Loss) earnings before income taxes $ (4.6) $ 3.9 $ (5.8) $ 7.3 Income tax (recovery) expense (9.4) 1.8 (9.8) 2.5 Net income from discontinued operations before after-tax gain on disposal $ 4.8 $ 2.1 $ 4.0 $ 4.8 After-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations 16.5 — 16.5 — Net income from discontinued operations $ 21.3 $ 2.1 $ 20.5 $ 4.8 Net cash provided by operating activities was $215.2 million for the quarter compared to $180.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow (1) was $191.1 million for the quarter compared to $147.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities was $566.9 million compared to $408.4 million last year and free cash flow was $418.2 million , compared to $333.1 million in the same period last year. The cash conversion rate (1) for fiscal year 2024 was 151%. Growth and maintenance capital expenditures (1) totaled $91.7 million this quarter and $329.8 million for the year, mainly in support of accretive growth opportunities to expand the Civil global aviation training network. Net debt (1) at the end of the year was $2,914.2 million for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (1) of 3.17 times (2.89 times excluding Legacy Contracts (1) ). This compares to net debt of $3,085.4 million , for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.16 times at the end of the preceding quarter. Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) (1) was 5.9% this quarter compared to 7.0% last quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted ROCE includes the impact of $90.3 million in unfavourable Defense contract adjustments.

All such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of May 27, 2024 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after May 27, 2024.The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected fiscal 2025 financial results and in obtaining a better understanding of our anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Material assumptions The forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the prevailing market conditions, geopolitical instability, the customer receptivity to our training and operational support solutions, the accuracy of our estimates of addressable markets and market opportunity, the realization of anticipated annual recurring cost savings and other intended benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational excellence programs, the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressures and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased prices, the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs from global supply chain logistics challenges, the stability of foreign exchange rates, the ability to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the availability of borrowings to be drawn down under, and the utilization, of one or more of our senior credit agreements, our available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on our revolving credit facility, the balance available under our receivable purchase facility, the assumption that our cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future, access to expected capital resources within anticipated timeframes, no material financial, operational or competitive consequences from changes in regulations affecting our business, our ability to retain and attract new business, our ability to effectively execute and retire the Legacy Contracts while managing the risks associated therewith, and our ability to complete the integration of the AirCentre business and the separation of the CAE Healthcare business within the anticipated time periods and at the expected cost levels. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release and, consequently, the forward‐looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 available on our website ( www.cae.com ), SEDAR+ ( www.SEDARplus.ca ) and EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ). Material risks Important risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements are set out in CAE's MD&A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, available on our website ( www.cae.com ), SEDAR+ ( www.SEDARplus.ca ) and EDGAR ( www.sec.gov ). Readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward-looking statements. We caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. Non-IFRS and other financial measures This press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures. These measures are not standardized financial measures prescribed under IFRS and therefore should not be confused with, or used as an alternative for, performance measures calculated according to IFRS. Furthermore, these measures should not be compared with similarly titled measures provided or used by other issuers. Management believes that these measures provide additional insight into our operating performance and trends and facilitate comparisons across reporting periods. Certain non-IFRS and other financial measures are provided on a consolidated basis and separately for each of our segments (Civil Aviation and Defense and Security) since we analyze their results and performance separately. Loading... Loading... Reconciliations and calculations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures under IFRS are also set forth below in the section Reconciliations and Calculations of this press release. Performance measures Operating income margin (or operating income as a % of revenue) Operating income margin is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing our operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income or loss Adjusted segment operating income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure that gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment's performance. We calculate adjusted segment operating income by taking operating income and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We track adjusted segment operating income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income on a consolidated basis is a total of segments measure since it is the profitability measure employed by management for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted segment operating income margin (or adjusted segment operating income as a % of revenue) Adjusted segment operating income margin is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing our adjusted segment operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted effective tax rate Adjusted effective tax rate is a supplementary financial measure that represents the effective tax rate on adjusted net income or loss. It is calculated by dividing our income tax expense by our earnings before income taxes, adjusting for the same items used to determine adjusted net income or loss. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of the impact of changes in income tax rates and the mix of income on our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted net income or loss Adjusted net income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results. We calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We track adjusted net income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted earnings or loss per share (EPS) Adjusted earnings or loss per share is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing adjusted net income or loss by the weighted average number of diluted shares. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance on a per share basis and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure which comprises net income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes, finance expense – net, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Free cash flow Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations. We use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity. We calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities, subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, intangible assets expenditures excluding capitalized development costs, other investing activities not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds, net of payments, from equity accounted investees. Cash conversion rate Cash conversion rate is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income. We use it to assess our performance in cash flow generation and as a basis for evaluating our capitalization structure. Liquidity and Capital Structure measures Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) Adjusted ROCE is a non-IFRS ratio calculated over a rolling four-quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations adjusting for net finance expense, after tax, restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events divided by the average capital employed from continuing operations. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 ). We use adjusted ROCE to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital. Net debt Net debt is a capital management measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS ratio calculated as net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. We use it because it reflects our ability to service our debt obligations. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our ability to service our debt obligations. Maintenance and growth capital expenditures Maintenance capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity. Growth capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity. The sum of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures represents our total property, plant and equipment expenditures. Growth measures Adjusted order intake Adjusted order intake is a supplementary financial measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received: For the Civil Aviation segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Additionally, expected future revenues from customers under short-term and long-term training contracts are included when these customers commit to pay us training fees, or when we reasonably expect the revenue to be generated; For the Defense and Security segment, we consider an item part of our adjusted order intake when we have a legally binding commercial agreement with a client that includes enough detail about each party's obligations to form the basis for a contract. Defense and Security contracts are usually executed over a long-term period but some of them must be renewed each year. For this segment, we only include a contract item in adjusted order intake when the customer has authorized the contract item and has received funding for it. Adjusted backlog Adjusted backlog is a supplementary financial measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog, joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options: Obligated backlog represents the value of our adjusted order intake not yet executed and is calculated by adding the adjusted order intake of the current period to the balance of the obligated backlog at the end of the previous fiscal year, subtracting the revenue recognized in the current period and adding or subtracting backlog adjustments. If the amount of an order already recognized in a previous fiscal year is modified, the backlog is revised through adjustments; Joint venture backlog is obligated backlog that represents the expected value of our share of orders that our joint ventures have received but have not yet executed. Joint venture backlog is determined on the same basis as obligated backlog described above; Unfunded backlog represents legally binding Defense and Security orders with the U.S. government that we have received but have not yet executed and for which funding authorization has not yet been obtained. The uncertainty relates to the timing of the funding authorization, which is influenced by the government's budget cycle, based on a September year-end. Options are included in adjusted backlog when there is a high probability of being exercised, which we define as at least 80% probable, but multi-award indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ) contracts are excluded. When an option is exercised, it is considered adjusted order intake in that period, and it is removed from unfunded backlog and options. Book-to-sales ratio The book-to-sales ratio is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing adjusted order intake by revenue in a given period. We use it to monitor the level of future growth of the business over time. Supplementary non-financial information definitions Full-flight simulators (FFSs) in CAE's network A FFS is a full-size replica of a specific make, model and series of an aircraft cockpit, including a motion system. In our count of FFSs in the network, we generally only include FFSs that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices, or other lower-level devices, as these are typically used in addition to FFSs in the same approved training programs. Simulator equivalent unit (SEU) SEU is a measure we use to show the total average number of FFSs available to generate earnings during the period. For example, in the case of a 50/50 flight training joint venture, we will report only 50% of the FFSs under this joint venture as a SEU. If a FFS is being powered down and relocated, it will not be included as a SEU until the FFS is re-installed and available to generate earnings. Utilization rate Utilization rate is a measure we use to assess the performance of our Civil simulator training network. While utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized, we track it, together with other measures, because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance. We calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period.

        "content": "A crowd of about 350 commemorated Memorial Day on Monday at the Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center with a ceremony that included adding six new names to the veterans memorial there. Family members laid roses next to the marker, with the added names of Oliver V. Rasmussen, Thomas E. Riggs and brothers Daniel, David and Freddie Salinas. Randy Riggs, McLennan County tax assessor-collector, lays a rose at the memorial marker listing his father, Thomas E. Riggs, who was one of six names added to the memorial wall after his death earlier this year. Keynote speaker U.S. Army Lt. Col. Allen West told the crowd he wished the event could be held at a packed McLane Stadium to truly honor the sacrifices by the veterans honored here. He encouraged people to increase their devotion to honor these veterans. He also reflected on his motorcycle accident four years ago during the Memorial Day weekend and the care he received from his injuries at the Doris Miller center and was ultimately able to walk out of that building. U.S. Army Lt. Col. (retired) Allen West delivers the main address Monday at the Memorial Day ceremony at the Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. West concluded his remarks by reading the 272 words of the Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln. Members of the Midway High School JROTC present the colors during the Memorial Day ceremony held Monday at the Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Waco.

        "content": "The Strathcona Regional District is working on improving accessibility in the region, following rules set out by the province. The SRD announced the plan, which was approved in April, in recognition of National AccessAbility week (May 26 to June 2, 2024. The plan comes after the province enacted the Accessible BC act, mandating public organizations establish accessibility committees and develop accessibility plans. The act also directs governments to provide public feedback mechanisms to help identify and address barriers to accessibility. “In response, the SRD partnered with The City of Campbell River, the Village of Sayward, the Village of Zeballos, the Village of Tahsis, the Village of Gold River, Vancouver Island West School District 84, and the Vancouver Island Regional Library to establish the Strathcona Accessibility and Inclusion Advisory Committee (SAIAC), develop an Accessibility Plan and implement the feedback mechanism,” a release from the SRD says. The committee was established last year, and includes volunteer members from across the region. Those volunteer members provided feedback on the plan prior to its release. “The committee, representing a diverse range of voices is passionate about creating an inclusive region,” says Susan Sinnott, committee chair. “The approved accessibility plan marks the first step towards making our region and public institutions more inclusive for everyone.” “The partners of the Strathcona Regional Accessibility Plan and the SAIAC will prioritize the identified barriers, work to eliminate them, and report on the progress to do so,” the release says. “The Strathcona Accessibility Plan will be updated at least once every three years.” People can provide feedback online, and residents from throughout the region can provide information regarding barriers they have experienced or witnessed when accessing public services, programs and facilities. The SAIAC populated a list of barriers experienced, the public is also invited to add to this list through the feedback mechanism. The plan and feedback mechanism are located at www.srd.ca/accessibility .

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

Adjusted segment operating income was (12.8% of revenue) ( excluding Legacy Contracts, 14.9% of revenue) compared to (13.4% of revenue) last year. During the quarter, Civil signed training and operational support solutions contracts valued at . These included the sale of 7 full-flight simulators (FFSs) and long-term training and digital flight services contracts. For the year, Civil booked orders for a record , including 64 FFS sales (vs. 62 in the prior fiscal year) and comprehensive, long-term training agreements with customers worldwide. The Civil book-to-sales ratio was 1.19x for the quarter and 1.24x for the last 12 months. The Civil adjusted backlog at the end of the year was a record , which is up 12% from the prior year period. During the quarter, Defense booked orders for , bringing the full-year total to . The Defense book-to-sales ratio was 1.69x for the quarter and 1.04x for the last 12 months. The Defense adjusted backlog at the end of the year was . In addition, the Defense pipeline strengthened with some of bids and proposals pending customer decisions. As previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years . The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits. CAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre). The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to , mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on , to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses. Net finance expense this quarter amounted to , compared to in the preceding quarter and in the fourth quarter last year. Income tax recovery this quarter was , representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate , which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions. Net income from discontinued operations was this quarter compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business. Net cash provided by operating activities was for the quarter compared to in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow was for the quarter compared to in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities was compared to last year and free cash flow was , compared to in the same period last year. The cash conversion rate for fiscal year 2024 was 151%. Growth and maintenance capital expenditures totaled this quarter and for the year, mainly in support of accretive growth opportunities to expand the Civil global aviation training network. Net debt at the end of the year was for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.17 times (2.89 times excluding Legacy Contracts ). This compares to net debt of , for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.16 times at the end of the preceding quarter. Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) was 5.9% this quarter compared to 7.0% last quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted ROCE includes the impact of in unfavourable Defense contract adjustments. This quarter, CAE submitted near-term (10 years) science-based reduction targets for validation by SBTi, an achievement that positions CAE on the net zero trajectory. Upon approval, these ambitious targets will guide our decarbonization journey organized around four value streams: aviation, sourcing, products and services, and buildings, which will help us transition from carbon neutrality to net zero emissions. Such an objective requires the mobilization of all our value chain which is why we introduced our new Supply Chain Management Program, CAE Resilient Together, designed to mutually reinforce both operational excellence and sustainability with our partners. Our carbon built-on approach extends to our business strategic planning and decision-making as we know that sustainability is a paramount long-term value driver. We have also contributed to raise awareness on the crucial role of sustainable aviation fuel via CAE Crew Training, for all business aviation pilots training with us. In addition, we remain strongly committed to creating social value and fostering an inclusive and diverse culture. Our efforts to strengthen relations with Indigenous Peoples in and around the world have been recognized through our first certification as a Progressive Aboriginal Relations Bronze company.

CAE confirms all of the 2025 guidance originally disclosed on , including for Civil and Defense, for finance expense and tax expense, and for balanced capital allocation priorities and accretive growth investments. CAE reiterates that a tenet of its capital management priorities includes the maintenance of a solid financial position, and it expects to continue to bolster its balance sheet through ongoing deleveraging, commensurate with its investment grade profile. Management's outlook for fiscal year 2025 and the targets outlined in CAE's press release ( ) and expectations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and are based on a number of assumptions, including in relation to prevailing market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, supply chains and labor markets.

This summary earnings press release contains limited information meant to assist the reader in assessing CAE's performance, but it is not a suitable source of information for readers who are unfamiliar with CAE and is not in any way a substitute for the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, and MD&A reports. This press release includes forward-looking statements about our activities, events and developments that we expect to or anticipate may occur in the future including, for example, statements about our vision, strategies, market trends and outlook, future revenues, earnings, cash flow growth, profit trends, growth capital spending, expansions and new initiatives, including initiatives that pertain to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, financial obligations, available liquidities, expected sales, general economic and political outlook, inflation trends, prospects and trends of an industry, expected annual recurring cost savings from operational excellence programs, our management of the supply chain, estimated addressable markets, demands for CAE's products and services, our access to capital resources, our financial position, the expected accretion in various financial metrics, the expected capital returns to shareholders, our business outlook, business opportunities, objectives, development, plans, growth strategies and other strategic priorities, and our competitive and leadership position in our markets, the expansion of our market shares, CAE's ability and preparedness to respond to demand for new technologies, the sustainability of our operations, our ability to retire the Legacy Contracts as expected and to manage and mitigate the risks associated therewith, the impact of the retirement of the Legacy Contracts, expected results from the re-baselining of the Defense business, management outlook for fiscal year 2025, the establishment of a NCIB program, the introduction of a shareholder dividend and other statements that are not historical facts. Since forward-looking statements and information relate to future events or future performance and reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events, they are typically identified by words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"likely\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"will\", \"strategy\", \"future\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. All such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of May 27, 2024 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after May 27, 2024.The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected fiscal 2025 financial results and in obtaining a better understanding of our anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the prevailing market conditions, geopolitical instability, the customer receptivity to our training and operational support solutions, the accuracy of our estimates of addressable markets and market opportunity, the realization of anticipated annual recurring cost savings and other intended benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational excellence programs, the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressures and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased prices, the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs from global supply chain logistics challenges, the stability of foreign exchange rates, the ability to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the availability of borrowings to be drawn down under, and the utilization, of one or more of our senior credit agreements, our available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on our revolving credit facility, the balance available under our receivable purchase facility, the assumption that our cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future, access to expected capital resources within anticipated timeframes, no material financial, operational or competitive consequences from changes in regulations affecting our business, our ability to retain and attract new business, our ability to effectively execute and retire the Legacy Contracts while managing the risks associated therewith, and our ability to complete the integration of the AirCentre business and the separation of the CAE Healthcare business within the anticipated time periods and at the expected cost levels. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release and, consequently, the forward‐looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). Important risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements are set out in CAE's MD&A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). Readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward-looking statements. We caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. This press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures. These measures are not standardized financial measures prescribed under IFRS and therefore should not be confused with, or used as an alternative for, performance measures calculated according to IFRS. Furthermore, these measures should not be compared with similarly titled measures provided or used by other issuers. Management believes that these measures provide additional insight into our operating performance and trends and facilitate comparisons across reporting periods. Certain non-IFRS and other financial measures are provided on a consolidated basis and separately for each of our segments (Civil Aviation and Defense and Security) since we analyze their results and performance separately. Reconciliations and calculations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures under IFRS are also set forth below in the section of this press release. Operating income margin is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing our operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure that gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment's performance. We calculate adjusted segment operating income by taking operating income and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We track adjusted segment operating income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income on a consolidated basis is a total of segments measure since it is the profitability measure employed by management for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted segment operating income margin is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing our adjusted segment operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted effective tax rate is a supplementary financial measure that represents the effective tax rate on adjusted net income or loss. It is calculated by dividing our income tax expense by our earnings before income taxes, adjusting for the same items used to determine adjusted net income or loss. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of the impact of changes in income tax rates and the mix of income on our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted net income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results. We calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We track adjusted net income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted earnings or loss per share is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing adjusted net income or loss by the weighted average number of diluted shares. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance on a per share basis and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure which comprises net income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes, finance expense – net, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations. We use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity. We calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities, subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, intangible assets expenditures excluding capitalized development costs, other investing activities not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds, net of payments, from equity accounted investees. Cash conversion rate is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income. We use it to assess our performance in cash flow generation and as a basis for evaluating our capitalization structure. Adjusted ROCE is a non-IFRS ratio calculated over a rolling four-quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations adjusting for net finance expense, after tax, restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events divided by the average capital employed from continuing operations. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We use adjusted ROCE to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital. Net debt is a capital management measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS ratio calculated as net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. We use it because it reflects our ability to service our debt obligations. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our ability to service our debt obligations. Maintenance capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity. Growth capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity. The sum of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures represents our total property, plant and equipment expenditures. Adjusted order intake is a supplementary financial measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received: Adjusted backlog is a supplementary financial measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog, joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options: The book-to-sales ratio is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing adjusted order intake by revenue in a given period. We use it to monitor the level of future growth of the business over time. A FFS is a full-size replica of a specific make, model and series of an aircraft cockpit, including a motion system. In our count of FFSs in the network, we generally only include FFSs that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices, or other lower-level devices, as these are typically used in addition to FFSs in the same approved training programs. SEU is a measure we use to show the total average number of FFSs available to generate earnings during the period. For example, in the case of a 50/50 flight training joint venture, we will report only 50% of the FFSs under this joint venture as a SEU. If a FFS is being powered down and relocated, it will not be included as a SEU until the FFS is re-installed and available to generate earnings. Utilization rate is a measure we use to assess the performance of our Civil simulator training network. While utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized, we track it, together with other measures, because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance. We calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period. For non-IFRS and other financial measures monitored by CAE, and a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS, please refer to Section 12 of CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 (which is incorporated by reference into this press release) available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). , Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Enterprise Risk Management, 1-514-734-5760, , Vice President, Public Affairs and Global Communications, 1-438-805-5856, SOURCE CAE Inc.",

        "content": "Does Bayern Munich have another possible Manuel Neuer replacement on the horizon? Replacing a GOAT is never easy, and Neuer, 38, is as generation-defining as they come. So despite still having options on hand like Alexander Nübel — who just had a fine season on loan at Stuttgart and received a provisional call-up to Julian Nagelsmann’s EURO 2024 squad for Germany — and last season’s signing Daniel Peretz, the Bavarians are still on the hunt. Now they have identified FC Köln keeper Jonas Urbig, a 20-year-old Germany youth international who spent the last season on loan at SpVgg Greuther Fürth. If Bayern gets him, he would likely be sent out on loan to gain experience — perhaps joining both Nübel and Peretz in that department next year. From Sport Bild, via @iMiaSanMia : Bayern are interested in Köln and Germany U21 goalkeeper Jonas Urbig (20), who spent the season on loan at Greuther Fürth. Walter Junghans, former Bayern goalkeeper and current scout, was in attendance in Fürth several times to watch Armindo Sieb as well as Urbig. Urbig is considered one of the biggest goalkeeping talents in Germany and his style is reminiscent of Manuel Neuer. Should he join Bayern, he could be loaned out to develop further. For now, Urbig will return to Köln although the club is preparing for his potential departure [@BILD] In Nübel (27), Peretz (23), and now Urbig (20), Bayern would have a strong and age-staggered pipeline of goalkeeper reinforcements for whenever Neuer decides to hang up his boots. If the Bavarians can pull this off, credit to the front office for long-term planning. Looking for more thoughts and analysis of Bayern Munich’s potential hiring of Vincent Kompany, plus the latest transfer rumors involving Bayern and VfB Stuttgart’s Chris Führich, AC Milan ’s Theo Hernandez, and...Jamal Musiala?

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "The trial of a Summerland man was delayed for the third time after he started sharing ‘conspiracy theories’ while on the stand in a different case. Garret Cole Sedawie appeared in Penticton Provincial Court on May 27 for what was planned to be a trial for charges of assault with a weapon and mischief under $5,000 from an incident that occurred in August of 2021. It was the third trial date scheduled for the case, after a previous attempt in 2023 was canceled over disagreements that saw Sedawie seek out a different lawyer, and the most recent trial date on May didn’t make it much further. The court was told that on May 23, while on the stand for a different assault case, Sedawie had begun talking about how he believed that RCMP and the alleged victim had conspired together to bring the charges forward as part of a plan to get him a criminal record. “What I’m concerned about is the current circumstances, your honor, whether he is fit to stand trial at this time given his testimony that day with regards to the conspiracy theories,” Crown said. After some discussion, including the unusual nature of having Crown prosecution be the one to ask for an assessment instead of defence, the judge agreed to order Sedawie to undergo a fitness test. If Sedawie is deemed fit to stand trial, which means he is capable of understanding court proceedings and participating in the trial, he could still undergo a Not Criminally Responsible hearing at a later date. Sedawie is currently scheduled to appear in court on June 26 to confirm that the fitness assessment process is underway. According to court records, the case in which Sedawie spoke of the conspiracy theories is scheduled for a decision on June 3.",

        "content": "An increasing number of people in Pakistan are losing their lives each year as a result of antimicrobial resistance. It is the third most common cause of death, after illnesses affecting mothers and newborns and cardiovascular disease. These concerning figures highlight a serious condition and were recently revealed at the National Antimicrobial Stewardship Summit 2024. Hailed as “wonder drugs,” antibiotics have prevented many deaths. But the widespread abuse of them has led to a public health emergency. In 2023 alone, Pakistan—the third-largest antibiotic user in the world—spent Rs126 billion on these medications. Because of excessive use, germs are now showing resistance to antibiotics from the third and fourth generations, which is a grave consequence. There are numerous causes of this problem. The main offenders include self-medication, “prescriptions” written by quacks, partial antibiotic regimens, and poor manufacturing techniques. Furthermore, 80 percent of cases of antimicrobial resistance in this industry are caused by the abuse of antibiotics in cattle, which exacerbates the issue. This affects not only people’s health but also the safety of food supplies. The government must use patient education, healthcare professional training, awareness campaigns, school and community programs, and the distribution of educational materials at pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics to try to raise public and professional understanding of antibiotic resistance. Strict laws governing the sale of antibiotics must also be enforced by the government, guaranteeing that they may only be obtained with a prescription from a qualified physician. To ensure the development of high-quality antibiotics, drug corporations should also be subject to strict regulation. Furthermore, infrastructure spending for healthcare is essential. Overprescription can be reduced by bolstering antimicrobial stewardship initiatives that support hospitals’ judicious use of antibiotics. The Covid-19 epidemic, which saw a jump in antibiotic use despite clinical guidelines advising against treatment for viral illnesses, is one example of a historical health crisis that should be included in these programs. Vaccination campaigns can also be quite important in preventing diseases that might otherwise require the use of antibiotics. Such approaches are effective, as seen by the success of the typhoid conjugate vaccine campaign in Sindh. AMR hangs heavy, with the potential to reverse decades of medical advancement and make common infections incurable. We can only hope to prevent antibiotic overuse from wreaking havoc on public health and preserve it for future generations by making consistent efforts.",

        "content": "According to NBA insider Marc Stein , “it is believed” Darius Garland will request a trade if Donovan Mitchell signs an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group is Paul’s agent. “The Cavaliers remain hopeful that Mitchell, 27, agrees to a sign a four-year contract extension worth nearly $210 million after the NBA Finals ... though it is believed that scenario could prompt Rich Paul-repped Garland to seek a trade,” Stein wrote. Garland averaged 18.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 6.5 assists for the Cavaliers this season while shooting 44.6% from the field, 37.1% from beyond the arc and 83.4% from the free-throw line. The Cavaliers signed Garland to a five-year, $197 million extension in July 2022. The guard will make $36.7 million next season. During an interview with NBA reporter Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report , Paul was asked if Garland would request a trade from the Cavaliers if Mitchell signed an extension this summer. Paul gave Haynes a detailed answer. “There is not much to say,” Paul said. “I think people have their own opinions of what works and what doesn’t work. For me, I think people around the league know and you definitely know this about me, I’m very matter of fact with my approach on everything. If there was something to be discussed, I would discuss it. “As of now, there’s nothing to discuss on that. My job is to evaluate every situation for every guy that we as a company represent. I’m a representative of players and I help advise them on business decisions. It’s a lot more to it than just negotiating a contract after four years. Some guys choose to do that and only focus on that. I’m different. I try to look at everything.” The Cavaliers drafted Garland with the fifth pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. The 24-year-old has career averages of 18.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists. “You try to position guys a certain way to continue to have value,” Paul said. “It’s the same way I go about the draft. I think you know that as well. I’m not really focused on certain things in terms of rankings. The league is one that is fluid. It doesn’t stop for nobody. It continues to move on. “And so these guys have to make sure they understand that having the talent they have, and the production, allows them to maintain value. That value transitions into compensation and when you sum it all up, it’s really just a good ass job and sometimes you have to protect that for as long as you can. That’s where my mindset is for all the guys. No matter if they’re a max player or a minimum guy. My job is to prepare, educate and execute for my clients.” Garland has been linked to the San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Lakers in NBA trade rumors.

        "description": "Despite not having the likes of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets, Inter Miami continue to lead the way in the latest edition of the MLS Power Rankings.",
        "content": "It's Monday, and another week of action is in the books, which means it's time for ESPN's Power Rankings. Our Power Rankings are derived from a combination of key season statistics (points per game, goal differential, expected goal differential), recent performance, the Opta computer ratings and the observations of our writers. Who's climbing the table? Who's in free fall? We've ranked all 29 clubs in the league after Matchday 16. Let's dive in. 1 To the chagrin of eager away supporters hoping to see the GOAT, Miami beat Vancouver 2-1 with , and absent. That's a win in multiple ways for the Herons, who've come away with mixed results in matches missing Messi. and had the goals, with the latter marking his second goal in two straight games after he scored the match winner against D.C. 2 FCC picked up their seventh straight win after a 4-3 goal-fest with Toronto. The Blue and Orange are famous for victories by one-goal margins, and this one marks their ninth of the year, though Saturday's victory is unique in needing four goals to get it ( notched a brace and set up a third to achieve it). Cincinnati are consistent winners, but they'll rue allowing four goals at home, especially as they account for more than a quarter (28.5%) of the goals they've allowed this season. 3 By the 59th minute, RSL trailed 3-0 at Toyota Stadium in Texas, but resilience was key as they absconded with a draw. was first to take one back, kick-starting a three-goal response with off the bench for a banger and also off the bench to make it three. Despite the early setback, Pablo Mastroeni's squad showed grit and depth as they continue their 11-game unbeaten run. 4 picked up a brace in Orlando to seal a 2-0 victory on the road (their third straight win away from home) as the Crew wrapped up league play on a high note, before heading to Mexico for their clash with next weekend. 5 LAFC picked up their third straight win on the road in Atlanta after 's professional foul gave them a 1-0 lead from the penalty spot. It wasn't their cleanest game, but they're building momentum toward an end-of-season that could be scary. Somewhere across the ocean, wrapped up his season with as he readies to become the latest international star to join the Black and Gold. Mateusz Bogusz slots in the goal for LAFC 6 NYRB had a bye this weekend, allowing more time to nurse their wounds after falling to NYCFC in Rivalry Week. 7 Minnesota held sway over the game early but allowed Colorado to come creeping back. Loons' keeper made five saves and came up big at the penalty spot to keep from a brace, but allowed a flimsy goal just minutes later to end the game 3-3. 8 A 1-0 victory against the bottom-ranked team in the league isn't the most resounding victory. Still, a win is a win. This one comes complement of ' 81st-minute header assisted by . 9 The Galaxy came from behind to defeat Houston 2-1, breaking a five-game winless run with their first victory since April 21. and whipped in the goals to seal it. 10 Philly broke their six-game winless rut against the worst team in the league the weekend previous and took a point on the road with a 0-0 draw in Charlotte on Saturday. The team is still looking to get back toward their full potential, though a summer of uncertainty (the fate of could shift their season) and various international duties looms near. 14 Colorado clawed from behind to collect a draw after trailing 3-1 in the first half. Brazilian forward Rafael Navarro scored his fifth goal in five games to bring his season tally to nine, pressing his importance for Colorado as his loan nears its completion this June, with many hoping he'll stay in Colorado. 13 Another draw for Dean Smith's squad of formidable defending. Their visitors from Philly have scored 25 goals in 14 games, so a 0-0 clean sheet is yet more evidence of their firm foundations. Charlotte is tied with Columbus for the fewest goals allowed (13) in the league and ranked first for the fewest goals per game. 11 The scoreline was respectable for the Whitecaps, who fell 1-2 to visitors from Miami. But losing to the Herons before a record-setting crowd of 51,035 while Miami was missing Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets is a missed opportunity. On the plus side: the crowd seemed to enjoy themselves as they feasted on half-price food, even if they did chant, \"Where is Messi?\" at the beginning of the game. 12 D.C. made it a three-game winless run this weekend, though this time it was a draw. D.C. still has so much going for them (An MVP-worthy player in , for example), but taking just a point from among the worst teams in the league (Chicago Fire) is a poor way to capitalize. 17 Seattle left St. Louis with a 2-1 win Saturday night to mark their fourth win of the season, moving just inside the playoff spots for the first time this year. With 15 games gone and a lot of season left before us, ye olde West Coast juggernauts will hope to build on that playoff position momentum. A perfect through ball from Albert Rusnák is finished off by Jordan Morris. 👏 15 Toronto lost to FC Cincinnati at the weekend but can be proud of how they played. With absent due to yellow card accumulation, John Herdman's squad collected three goals against a team that's allowed just 14 in 15 games this season. (That's the third lowest in the league, with only Charlotte and Columbus allowing fewer.) 19 In Orlando's defense, Columbus have among the best keepers in the league in . Despite registering four big chances, Schulte saved them all and kept a clean sheet for the formidable visitors who kept their win streak alive on the road. 23 Portland sit 19th in the Supporters Shield race but third in goals scored (28) across the league. Only top-ranked teams Inter Miami and RSL have put more past their opposition. The Timbers can score. But can they defend? Remarkably, they also rank third across the league for goals conceded (30). If nothing else, they make for entertaining games, and this time the result went in their favor as they defeated SKC 2-1. set up the first and scored the second. ( finished the first and assisted the second). 18 's first goal of the year wasn't enough to offset the Galaxy's attacking inevitability (LA's 27 goals are the fourth most in MLS), as Houston succumbed to a 2-1 loss in LA. Still, in search of reliable goalscorers, Houston sit opposite end of the goal tally spectrum from the Galaxy, as they've notched just 13 in 14 games (second fewest in the league behind only New England). 16 Brad Guzan's professional foul brought Atlanta down to ten men in the 60th minute. The ensuing penalty gave LAFC a 1-0 lead which they saw out to the end. The loss makes it 9 without a win. Next up? Miami. 21 Austin is a team with heart, and they showed some on the road to come from behind to snag a draw against the San Jose Earthquakes. Their offensive production was looking a bit woeful, though, as they registered just five shots and only one on target against the team that's allowed more goals (34) than anyone else this season. 20 St. Louis were a bit unlucky in their loss to Seattle, conceding by way of an own goal before popped in to make it 2-0. They took one goal back but not enough to draw level, marking their second loss in as many games. Herculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. 22 Nashville picked up a 0-0 draw in their second match under new interim manager Rumba Munthali. The jury is still out on how the post-Gary Smith era will look this season. Incidentally, that's their seventh draw this year, putting them in a three-way tie for most in the league. 25 Dallas looked ready to do the unexpected Saturday, as they led 3-0 at home against the top-ranked West Coast side, Real Salt Lake. Tragically for the , s 61st-minute goal kickstarted a comeback that ended 3-3 by the final whistle. Silver lining? If fans manage to forget how things started, a point against RSL is still a result to be proud of. 24 They held Portland off for most of the match but Evander struck twice (first with an assist then with a goal) to ensure Kansas City their fifth straight loss in league play. They host Vancouver next at home with their season hitting a bit of freefall. 26 San Jose took the initial lead and came within a hair's breadth of all three points, but the post stopped them in stoppage time from what could have been their fourth win of the year. Alas, what could have been! Still, a 1-1 draw with Austin is respectable for a team that's lost 10 of their 15 games. 27 1-1 on the road against D.C. United is decent enough for the Fire. completed a solid team goal built patiently from the back, bringing them level from behind and showing hints of more quality the Fire may be hiding. 28 Montreal broke a four-game string of losses with a draw against Nashville. That's progress, especially since the last time they faced Nashville (May 4) they lost 4-1. That said, they still haven't won a game since April 13. 29 The Revs are as bad as you think they are. Actually, they could be worse. They did fire off 16 shots against NYCFC in a 1-0 loss at home, though none were real quality chances.",

        "content": "Conservatives are asking the House of Commons to vote to remove Speaker Greg Fergus from the role over partisan language that appeared in an ad for an event in his riding. Conservative MP Chris Warkentin moved a motion Monday afternoon that, if passed, would find Fergus in contempt of Parliament and declare the Speaker's chair vacant. \"This Speaker has demonstrated countless times that he is unfit to be a non-partisan speaker,\" Warkentin said in the House chamber. \"He's a very, very effective partisan Liberal and ... we've lost trust in his ability to govern this place.\" Conservative MP Chris Warkentin rises during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, May 4, 2023. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Warkentin moved the motion after Deputy Speaker Chris d'Entremont ruled that the use of partisan language in the ad amounted to a prima facie question of MPs' privilege. The online posting for \"A Summer Evening with the Honourable Greg Fergus\" included a line that took aim at Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. It accused him of pursuing Conservative policies \"that would risk our health, safety and pocketbooks\" and promoted a Liberal plan to \"grow an economy that works for everyone.\" The Liberal Party apologized to Fergus in a letter last week, saying the language posted on the event page was the auto-populated, standardized language the party uses for events on its website. The language was posted without Fergus's knowledge and \"as a result of a miscommunication between the Party and the riding association,\" said the letter from Azam Ishmael, the party's national director. \"The Liberal Party unequivocally apologizes to you for this mistake, and we take full responsibility.\" Analysis The Speaker is under attack again — maybe it's time for a more independent approach Liberal Party apologizes to Speaker after controversy erupts over partisan event posting Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux accused the Conservatives of launching a partisan attack on Fergus. \"They have constantly ... had it in for this Speaker,\" he said in the House. The Speaker presides over the business of the House of Commons and is meant to act as an impartial arbiter of House proceedings. While the Speaker is elected as a member of a party, the role is considered nonpartisan — no Speaker sits in a party caucus. This is not the first time Fergus, who was elected to the chair in October, has had his impartiality questioned by MPs. Fergus initially lost the support of Conservative and Bloc Québécois MPs when he taped a video tribute to outgoing Ontario Liberal leader John Fraser while wearing the Speaker's robes. He also participated in a fundraising event in his riding last fall, something billed as a \"cocktail militant\" for Liberal supporters. Fergus held onto his job after the NDP backed him during the fracas over the video. He apologized and paid a fine for breaking Commons rules that forbid the use of parliamentary resources for partisan purposes. Last week, NDP MP Peter Julian said Fergus behaved appropriately in this most recent case by having the event cleared by the Clerk before proposing to host it. An NDP spokesperson told CBC News that the party's position hasn't changed in light of d'Entremont's ruling.",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been \"comprehensive and multifaceted\" efforts to combat antisemtisim. \"Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia's president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a \"disgraceful\" attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. \"I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.\" Gertler said the school's senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university's faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the \"disgraceful historical practice\" of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. \"Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, \"processes are ongoing.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Advertisement",

        "description": "Fans spotted the sweet tribute.",
        "content": "Stevie Nicks just blew away fans with her performance at BottleRock Napa Valley – and eagle-eyed spectators spotted a subtle nod to Taylor Swift among the Fleetwood Mac icon’s accessories. Nicks, 76, was wearing a bracelet from Swift’s The Tortured Poet’s Department merch during her live performance, making it clear that she counts herself among the legions of Swifties who have kept TTPD as the number one album for weeks. Wearing all black and looking like an astrological witch as per usual, the Dreams icon sported layers of necklaces and bracelets, though the chunky gold-plated bracelet stood out among them. In a video a fan captured from the crowd, Nicks’ sleeve slipped back as she sang Gold Dust Woman, revealing the accessory. The bracelet is a chunky chain link that features the album’s logo and can be purchased for $40 from Swift’s official merch shop – a low price considering it can now technically be counted as a friendship bracelet with Stevie Nicks. Swift and Nicks have reportedly been friends for quite some time, and Swift even drops her name in Clara Bow on her new album, singing: ‘You look like Stevie Nicks / In ’75, the hair and lips / Crowd goes wild at her fingertips / Half moonshine, a full eclipse.’ The two singer songwriters first collaborated in 2010 when they duetted Rhiannon and You Belong with Me at the 2010 Grammys. It’s clear the friendship remains strong, as Nicks was intimately involved in the creation of TTPD, even writing a poem that tells the story of star-crossed lovers and is included in physical copies of the album. The poem, which is entitled For T and Me, reads in part: ‘He was in love with her / Or at least she thought so / She was brokenhearted / Maybe he was too / Neither of them knew / She was way too hot to handle / He was way too high to try / He couldn’t even see her.’ It continues: ‘He really can’t answer her / He’s afraid of her / He’s hiding from her / And he knows that he’s hurting her.’ Harry Styles and Taylor Swift among former celebrity couples AI created fake children for Taylor Swift fan Scarlett Oliver dies aged 9 after rare brain cancer diagnosis The surprise reason why Jurgen Klopp will be back at Anfield as soon as next month Taylor Swift’s expected Eras Tour setlist for UK after Paris changes Nicks has previously praised Swift, saying in 2010 in a TIME profile: ‘Taylor reminds me of myself in her determination and her childlike nature. It’s an innocence that’s so special and so rare,’ she said. ‘Taylor can do ballads that could be considered pop or rock and then switch back into country. When I turned 20 years old, I had just made the serious decision to never be a dental assistant. Taylor just turned 20, and she’s won four Grammys.’ Nicks also told Today in an interview last year that her and Swift have a lot in common in terms of their songwriting styles: ‘I never don’t tell the truth. And I think that’s something that if Taylor Swift, who is my friend, if Taylor got anything from me, that’s what she got.’ She continued: ‘I don’t ever lie in my songs,and if you broke up with me, I don’t put I broke up with you. I tell the truth, always.’ Got a story?

        "content": "He doesn’t even play in the same conference as the Cowboys, but it seems Dallas doesn’t have love for Travis Kelce. The Kansas City Chiefs star took in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves and was roundly booed when shown on the video board. Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, looked surprised, though he might have just been playing the moment up. The mood of the crowd changed when Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany were shown when the camera panned over. The crowd roared and Mahomes stood up to encourage more cheering. Mahomes hails from the Dallas area. Travis Kelce got boo’d and the crowd went crazy for Patrick Mahomes. pic.twitter.com/ZSX9rLDg7a Star Mavericks player Luka Doncic was more welcoming toward Kelce than the fans were. As Kelce waited post-game near the locker room, Doncic came over and gave him a hug. The Mavericks have a 3-0 lead over Minnesota and are looking to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 when they upset LeBron James and the Miami Heat for the only NBA title in franchise history. The series resumes on Tuesday in Dallas. Luka Doncic and Travis Kelce after the Mavericks take the 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals. pic.twitter.com/7VkS24A2M4 Kelce had attended the game between the Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers earlier in the week. Kelce played pee wee hockey for eight years as a kid in the Cleveland area and has posted about his love of the game. Mahomes had jokingly told Kelce to “get out of (his) arena” when Kelce attended the hockey game. Perhaps that’s why he joined him for some hoops action. The other Dallas Mavericks star, Kyrie Irving, famously helped bring Cleveland its first major sports title since 1964 when the Cavaliers won in 2016, so it’s likely Kelce is a big fan of Irving.",

        "content": "This article was originally published on The Conversation, an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts. Disclosure information is available on the original site. ___ Authors: Philip A Loring, Adjunct Associate Professor, University of Guelph; and Ryan M. Katz-Rosene, Associate Professor, School of Political Studies, L’Université d’Ottawa/University of Ottawa Rising food costs are squeezing Canadians around the country. Nearly everyone is feeling the pinch, and it’s not just an inconvenience — high food prices are a major threat to food security for many Canadians. Understanding why food prices are so high and why they are changing is critical to the well-being of our society. Unfortunately, consensus on why food price are so high is in short supply. Explanations given in reports like Canada’s Food Price Report and the news media range widely, from the war in Ukraine to supply chain issues to the carbon tax. Each year it seems the key drivers change, and if the growing consumer boycott of Loblaw’s is any indication, consumers want better answers. So, we completed a rigorous analysis of the most prominent reports that shape the narratives around food prices in Canada, including twelve years of Canada’s Food Price Reports and 39 reports from Statistics Canada. Our findings, which are peer reviewed and soon to be published in Canadian Food Studies, were both insightful and concerning. Lacking scientific rigour Our analysis found that most claims about food prices in these reports lack scientific rigour. Nearly two-thirds of the explanations for price changes given are not backed by evidence. Arguments about the causes of food inflation are frequently incomplete, neglecting to connect the dots between cause and effect. For instance, reports may identify the influence of unfavourable weather, climate change or changing retail demand, but fail to elaborate how these translate into actual price increases at the till. British philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin published a simple approach for evaluating the quality of scientific arguments in 1958. In a nutshell, for a scientific argument to be complete, it needs to have three components: a claim, verifiable observations or data that provide grounds for that claim, and an explicit theory or assumption that links the data logically to the claim. For scientific arguments to be rigorous, they should also back up the strength of their assumptions and qualify their claims by exploring reasonable counterarguments. However, most of the arguments in these reports fall short of this, failing even to provide basic evidence in support of their claims. These reports are not scientific publications, but rather qualify as “grey literature” — information produced outside traditional academic publishing channels. Nevertheless, they are published under the logos of academic institutions and government agencies. Given their prominence in Canadian media and policy, we believe it is important for the public to know that the arguments presented in these reports do not live up to scientific standards. Overlooking key issues While the reports do identify potential drivers of food prices, they have some noteworthy gaps. While extreme weather events and climate change are sometimes offered as abstract reasons for food price increases, some major environmental issues, like biodiversity loss and collapsing fish stocks, do not appear in reports, despite a widespread understanding that they will impact food price and availability. These reports also rarely consider the decisions that grocers and other private sector entities have on food prices. Increased consolidation and concentration in the grocery sector is a structural issue that deserves scrutiny. The bread price-fixing scandal a few years ago showed how a lack of competition enables price manipulation and hurts consumers. Canada’s Competition Bureau recently announced they are launching an investigation into the owners of Loblaws and Sobeys for alleged anti-competitive conduct. In the United States, there is also strong evidence that the private sector has been profiteering on supply chain issues and inflation. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission likewise recently found that big grocers used the pandemic as a smokescreen to pad their profits at the public’s expense. With grocer profits expanding in Canada, too, it is fair to ask tough questions about how much grocers’ decisions are contributing to the pain at the till. In our analysis, only three per cent of the over 200 explanations for food price changes point to grocer actions or other agency in the private sector as driving price increases. This reflects a tendency to portray food prices as erratic and overwhelmingly opaque. Other issues — such as the over-reliance on fossil fuels across the supply chain — also go unmentioned. A new approach is needed Without rigorous and transparent analysis, we’re left with an incomplete picture of why food is so expensive and what we can do about it. What we need is a new approach. Food is a human right, but a unique one in that we rely on the private sector to provision it. We should expect a higher standard than with other consumer goods, and the private sector has arguably not earned the benefit of the doubt given their history of price fixing. One positive step towards generating trustworthy evidence about food prices would be to incorporate transparency measures into the code of conduct the Canadian government is developing with grocers. This could include third-party audits, open data-sharing and a clear breakdown of what’s driving price changes — from the farm to the shelf. Peer review of research is a critical aspect of responsible science. In our paper, we highlight the process that the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat provides for federal fisheries science, as one possible model for government-based food price reports. For something as essential as food, Canadians deserve the full story. For decades, policy and markets have been designed to keep food cheap, but at the expense of workers and the environment. If food prices are rising because they are starting to reflect the true social and ecological costs of production, we will need to enter a broader conversation about economic and livelihood reform to ensure that everyone can afford food. But without a clear picture of the actual drivers, we lack the necessary information for developing policies that protect the rights and well-being of Canadians.
