        "description": "Only six outs from state, the Serena Huskers’ run through the postseason came to an end Memorial Day afternoon with an eight-inning loss to Villa Grove.",
        "content": "BLOOMINGTON – Only six outs from state, the ’ run through the postseason came to an end Memorial Day afternoon. Villa Grove scored two times in the sixth inning to erase Serena’s two-run lead, then three times in the top of the eighth to take control of the Blue Devils’ eventual 5-2, extra-inning win over the Huskers in the Class 1A Illinois Wesleyan Supersectional on Inspiration Field at Carol Willis Park. “Like I told the girls,” Serena coach Kelly Baker said, “it just wasn’t our day. We did a lot of things right, but it wasn’t meant to be. “We didn’t look nervous. We didn’t have those jitters. I was so proud of the way they came out ... but things just didn’t go our way today.” Early on, they did. After getting a double from Paisley Twait in the bottom of the first inning but stranding the senior at first, Serena (22-8) came through in the third. No. 9 hitter Brynley Glade started things off with a one-out, Texas-league double to shallow center field. RayElle Brennan traded places with her immediately, cranking a double halfway up the fence in left to make it 1-0 Huskers. Brennan, who took third on the throw home trying to cut down Brynley Glade, scored herself on Jenna Setchell’s RBI groundout, making it 2-0 after three innings. “[This season] was just amazing,” Brennan said. “My team fought to get here. We battled every game, even this game. I’m so proud of my team. It was great. “I feel like it all started in the dugout. Our dugout built up, and we definitely had a very positive atmosphere there, and it showed on the field.” And there it stayed for a bit, as Huskers junior ace Maddie Glade started the day with a 1-2-3 top of the first and – after shutting out both Dwight and Newark in the 1A Woodland Sectional – ran her consecutive scoreless postseason inning streak to 25 by keeping the Blue Devils (25-13-1) off the scoreboard the opening five innings despite runners reaching in the second and fifth. The streak ended in the sixth, however. A leadoff walk to Villa Grove No. 9 hitter Chloe Reardon and a bloop single off the bat of Kayln Cordes came back to haunt Maddie Glade when her counterpart, Blue Devils pitcher Alexandria Brown, slugged a two-run double to right-center, scoring both Reardon and Cordes to tie the game 2-2. A strike from center fielder Cali Edwards to Twait at third cut down Brown trying to advance and helped the Huskers escape with the tie still intact. “I’ll tell you, [Serena] made some unbelievable plays,” Villa Grove coach Jeana Block said. “I said, ‘Just keep putting it in play, eventually it falls, that’s just how it works.’ And once we started putting the ball in play a little bit more, things fell our way. “And I knew once we tied it, we’ve got this.” Block’s words proved prophetic. While Serena went down quickly in the home half of the sixth and seventh innings, the Blue Devils continued to put pressure on Maddie Glade (8 IP, 4 ER, 9 H, 2 BB, 4 K) and what up to that point had been a phenomenal Huskers defensive effort – especially from Twait at third, Setchell at shortstop and Brynley Glade in right field. That pressure came to a head in the first extra inning. After a Cordes single and the second foul out of the game run down by Brynley Glade along the right-field fence line, Villa Grove No. 3 hitter Piper Kiser stepped in and stayed alive after hitting a pop foul of her own in the on-deck nook between the backstop and the Blue Devils’ dugout. Serena’s players and on-deck hitter Alison Pangburn got in each other’s way, but after Baker asked the umpires to meet and discuss a potential interference call, Kiser was allowed to step back into the batter’s box. Two pitches later, Kiser blasted a two-run, line-drive homer well over the fence in right field to give Villa Grove its first lead. The Blue Devils added another run thanks to two errors and a single. Brynley Glade doubled with two outs in the bottom of the eighth for her second hit of the day but was left stranded there when Brennan’s well-struck fly ball was run down just in front of the warning track in left to send the Blue Devils to next Friday’s state semifinals and the Huskers – co-Little Ten Conference champs, regional champs and sectional champs – home. “Once we got Brynley on second, I thought, ‘Maybe this is where we’re going to do it,’ ” Baker said. “But I’m so proud of them. “The seniors, they left our program in a better place.”",

        "description": "The Britain’s Got Talent live semi-finals kicked off on Monday.",
        "content": "The ITV talent show kicked off on Monday with the first live semi-final featuring judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli, alongside presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. A public vote saw singer Masuku automatically through to the final, while the judges voted for Ssaulabi Performance Troupe over dog act The Trickstars to continue to compete for the £250,000 prize and a spot at the Royal Variety Performance. They're going to need a big broom after that 🧹🔥 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/bVlRvy5bG5 — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 The South Korean taekwondo group, who were McPartlin and Donnelly’s golden buzzer act, said they practise five hours a day and received all four votes from the judges to make the final after their “cinematic blockbuster” live performance. “If that was a movie, that would have taken about a week to shoot literally, it would,” Cowell said of their performance. “And the fact that you did the whole thing live in about two-and-a-half minutes, says everything about you. “I forget how many years we’ve been doing this now actually, but this is actually one of the best live show performances I’ve ever seen on this show.” Meanwhile, South African opera singer Masuku, who wowed the judges in his January audition before getting married, said “this is my year” after winning a spot on the bill for the final. Innocent Masuku's voice holds so much power. Goosebumps!✨ #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/t3qTyljVqM — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Dixon described him as “the one to beat”, while Tonioli said his act was “flawless”. Cowell said: “How snobby classical music is, I mean it really is, it is just awful and you deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented, you performed like a lead, you have that presence about you and your control over the song, everything about it for me was immaculate.” The first live semi-final of this year saw Lucy Heath and her five dogs perform as The Trickstars to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory themed dance. The dog trainer made the final of the talent show eight years ago, but missed a spot in the final line-up following the judges’ unanimous vote. “I genuinely think your act has got better over the years,” Cowell said, adding he “loved it, loved it, loved it”. Now *this* is a Wonka Experience! 🍫🐾 #BGT pic.twitter.com/tmoYC5XWNA — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Tonioli described the act as “charming” while Holden said “you really are the golden ticket”, referencing the Roald Dahl classic book and film. Comedian Bikoon! was up next but saw Dixon, Tonioli and Holden press their red buzzer as his “magic” bag failed several times to perform a simple trick. Cowell was visibly upset at the end of the performance when the magic bag opened to reveal a man inside, to which McPartlin joked the pair were a “Japanese Ant & Dec”. Imagine explaining that at customs... 🧳 #BGT pic.twitter.com/riOM9USLjt — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 “I’m really upset, I think the bag should have remained a mystery,” Cowell said. Holden and Dixon also pressed their red buzzer for air guitar act Sven Smith. “Call me old-fashioned but I prefer a guitar and a microphone,” Dixon said, while Holden questioned his place in the semi-final. Tonioli’s golden buzzer recipient Taryn Charles received a much warmer response from the judges, after the singer performed a rendition of Lose Control by Teddy Swims. Cowell described it as a “genius choice of song”, adding: “I genuinely don’t think you could have done any more”, as well as calling it “beautifully raw”. We can't help but Lose Control whenever we hear Taryn's vocals 😱🤩 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/Y3h0mOzSxu — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 However, the judge was less impressed with his own golden buzzer act, rollerskating couple Duo Stardust from Ukraine. “It wasn’t as good as the audition, I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame – we lost the focus of you,” he said. The pair finished their performance picking Tonioli from the panel and spinning him high into the air, which he described as “scary”. Meanwhile, Cowell said he preferred the first half of 11-year-old dancer Trey Braine’s performance, but also revealed he recently used the schoolboy to exemplify “someone I believe has star potential – when you’ve got it, you’ve got it”. “You’re naturally cool, naturally stylish, I really believe great things are going to happen in your life and your career,” he said. The cast of Disney’s The Lion King also performed on the show, to celebrate 30 years since the release of the film.",

        "description": "The new ‘triple lock plus’ would ensure pensioners’ tax free allowance rises in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%.",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories, and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

        "description": "The new ‘triple lock plus’ would ensure pensioners’ tax free allowance rises in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%.",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories, and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

        "description": "Actress Susan Lucci claims she was approached to be the first-ever Golden Bachelorette, before Joan Vassos signed on.",
        "content": "There seems to be some conflicting stories about All My Children star Susan Lucci 's involvement with Golden Bachelorette . Before ABC chose Joan Vassos to helm the first-ever season of the spin-off, Lucci claims the show's producers approached her to be the leading lady. However, according to some insiders close to the show, that's not accurate. Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima shares the cosmetic procedure she gets twice a year Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima is taking full advantage of new found fame In an interview with People , Lucci said that her assistant turned her on to The Bachelor a few years ago, which led to her watching and becoming obsessed with Golden Bachelor. Lucci then revealed that she once had a chance at finding love on The Golden Bachelorette, but she turned it down . \"I believe that they contacted my publicist and it wasn't for me,\" Lucci, 77, explained. While she didn't feel like the gig would be a good fit for her personality, she did share that she loved watching the first season of Golden Bachelor, which starred Gerry Turner . \"I watched The Golden Bachelor. I really enjoyed watching The Golden Bachelor. This is a new addiction for me,\" Lucci said. Lucci, who portrayed Erica Kane for 41 years on All My Children from 1970 to 2011, also added: \"It wasn't for me, but I do love watching. I'm a fan. I love watching.\" However, a source close to the show told ET that Lucci's claim \"is not true.\" Earlier this month, ABC announced that Vassos would lead the inaugural Golden Bachelorette. Vassos was a contestant who tried winning Gerry's heart on The Golden Bachelor but she self-eliminated from the show when a medical concern with her daughter arose.

I want to have somebody in my life,\" Vassos said on the Bachelor Happy Hour: Golden Hour podcast. \"I feel like life is better when you share it with somebody. I truly believe all of that.\" \"As far as my heart being completely open, I think it's nine-tenths of the way there,\" the Rockland, Maryland native continued. \"So, I think I just need to spend a little more time in like an environment like The Bachelor environment...I so am not...like I really want to find love. I just don't want to go to the work of going on a dating website.\" Vassos has also revealed that she won't be following in Gerry and Theresa Nist 's footsteps. While opening up about the couple's divorce - which they claim is a result of being unwilling to move to be together - Joan revealed to CNN that she is unwilling to move for a man . Gerry and Theresa cited distance as their main issue and the unwillingness to move from their respective states and families — Gerry resides in Indiana while Theresa lives in New Jersey . Once Joan was announced the new Golden Bachelorette, many fans took to social media to voice their concerns about Vassos choosing a suitor who does not live near her. She said: “That was actually the first question that Gerry asked me. We sat down for the first time together and he said, ‘You live in Maryland, I live in Indiana. How do you see something like this working?’ \"My answer to him was — and it still is my answer — I think you almost have to live a dual life. I’ll never leave my family. They are the most important people in the world to me, obviously.” Joan continued: “I would expect that to be the same for the person that I end up with because family is so important to me. That would have to be a key part of their personality. \"You have to be willing to... travel and be with that person and maybe spend a couple of months or a couple of weeks at a time... and then maybe eventually, you figure out a destination that would work for you and your families or have another house where everybody gets together.”",

        "content": "The Alaska Highway is now open following weeks of halted traffic due to a large wildfire in the vicinity of Fort Nelson, British Columbia. The highway was closed on May 10 due to the threat posed by the Parker Lake wildfire west of Fort Nelson. Drive BC reports that piloted alternating traffic is in use and that travellers should expect delays. Limited visibility due to smoke is also noted. Highway 77, the route north from Fort Nelson into the Northwest Territories, has also reopened but motorists are warned not to stop on the road. Highway 37, the other route between B.C. and the Yukon, remained open throughout the Alaska Highway closure. As of 8 a.m. on May 27, the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation lifted their evacuation orders and road blocks were removed allowing evacuees to begin returning home. There are still fires burning in the area and an evacuation alert requiring that people be ready to leave on short notice remains in place. About 4,700 people were evacuated from the area May 10 as the fire spread close to the town. Despite firefighting efforts, the blaze destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties. Based on the most current information from the B.C. Wildfire Service, the Parker Lake fire is burning over 12,348 hectares. It is being worked on by 172 firefighters including a Yukon crew dispatched on May 16. The fire crews are being assisted by aircraft and heavy equipment as well as precipitation and cloud cover that's slowing fire behaviour above ground. However, the wildfire service also notes that persistent drought conditions make it likely that the fire will burn in duff layers under the ground. It is no longer expected to grow beyond its current boundaries.",

        "content": "Keith Urban is reportedly on his wife’s bad side after some recent flippant remarks brought back some bad memories for the actress. The country music icon has compared Ariana Grande ’s hit We Can’t Be Friends to illegal drugs on mutliple occassions, which has left Nicole Kidman “disappointed” in her beau. Last week, the 56-year-old performed an acoustic cover of the track for a small, intimate show and posted a clip of the gig to social media with the caption noting: “This song is audible heroin.” Who is Nicole Kidman's daughter Sunday Rose? Inside the enigmatic life of mini-me kid Nicole Kidman's hubby Keith Urban appears to 'check out' fellow Met Gala attendee Later, the Australian star doubled down on his claims in an interview with People, saying: “I cannot stop playing it. It's like audible heroin. Literally, I have to have another hit.” Now Nicole reportedly fears that Keith, who has openly spoken about his drug and alcohol addictions in the past, may be sending the wrong message to their teen daughters with his casual remarks. A source told Woman’s Day Magazine that while the 56-year-old wouldn’t ask her husband to take down a post, she is “disappointed” in him. They claimed the comments took her back to a “very dark time” in their relationship when “they almost split”. However, Nicole’s first priority is their daughters, 15-year-old Sunday and 13-year-old Faith, and she doesn’t want them to “start thinking it’s cool or OK or something you can easily ‘fix’,”.

Under his acoustic performance and raving review, the 30-year-old declared: “This is so beautiful.” The Hollywood power couple have open spoken about Keith’s addictions, recovery and the impact on their relationship. The musician last checked into rehab at the Betty Ford Center in 2006, after his new bride staged an intervention for him. Speaking to Rolling Stone a decade later, Keith candidly admitted the situation was so desperate he would have completely understood if Nicole chose to leave him during that rehab stint, particularly as they had been married less than a year. During a different interview with Oprah Winfrey, Keith revealed that his wife was working in Rome at the time but valiantly flew back to the States and rounded up his pals to stage his intervention. He recalled: “The love in that room in that moment was just right. To see love in action in that way... I'd never experienced anything like that before.”",

        "description": "Dozens gathered at Loveland Burial Park on Monday morning for a solemn tribute to men and women who gave their lives while serving in the U.S. armed forces.",
        "content": "During his four years in the U.S. Navy from 1968 to 1972, Don Cook served overseas, but he admits that he didn’t face much danger, at least not in the line of duty. “It was two and a half years of shore duty in Hawaii, and a year and a half racing motorcycles and playing beach football in Guam,” he said. But Cook knows that he is among the lucky ones serving during that era. On Monday, he came to Loveland Burial Park to pay his respects to those who didn’t make it back home from the Vietnam War. “I’m here to honor everyone who served during that time,” he said. “I can appreciate what they had to give up, because I didn’t.” Cook was one of dozens at the cemetery on Monday morning for the annual Memorial Day ceremony, hosted by the Associated Veterans of Loveland Honor Guard. Beforehand, volunteers gave attendees small poppy pins to wear, a symbol of remembrance since World War I. Tom Parker, Honor Guard commander, opened the ceremony with a reminder to the crowd of what the day is meant to commemorate. “As we stand here, surrounded by the echoes of history, we recognize that freedom comes at a cost,” he said. “It is paid for with the blood, sweat and tears of those who answered the call of duty, from battlefields of Gettysburg to the deserts of Iraq.” Members of the Thompson School District’s Junior ROTC representing Loveland and Mountain View high schools presented the colors, and new Thompson Valley High School graduate and former Jr. ROTC company commander Zienna Kaiser delivered a stirring rendition of the National Anthem, despite a microphone malfunction. The day’s guest speaker was Kip Turain, retired Air Force colonel and former ROTC commander at Colorado State University. He led the crowd through a short lesson on the history of Memorial Day, which was called “Decoration Day” when it began shortly after the Civil War. The colonel also spoke about visiting Normandy and the site of the D-Day landing in 1944, and realizing what American soldiers have been fighting for since the days of the Revolution. “We’re fighting for freedom and for those future generations of all people to experience and celebrate life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” he said. Following Turain’s remarks, Lorri McLaughlin, commander-elect of the VFW Post 41, read the names of the 34 AVOL members who have died in the last year, as quartermaster Dwayne Windisch rang a bell. American Legion Post 15 commander Wayne Schou and current VFW commander Mark Lyons also placed 34 red and white carnations in the memorial wreath. The ceremony closed with a rifle volley from the AVOL Honor Guard, followed by the sounding of Taps and a closing prayer from Honor Guard chaplain Theresa Windisch. “We remember before you our comrades now departed from this life,” she said. “We honor them for their loyalty to God and country, for their good deeds and for their friendship. May they rest in peace.”",

        "content": "North West, daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West recently made her acting debut. During The Lion King 's 30th anniversary concert, North played the role of Young Simba. Kim and Kanye attended the Hollywood Bowl to witness their daughter's performance of I Just Can't Wait To Be King. The performance which received a standing ovation from the audience, also brought North under the spotlight of online trolling. X users expressed their thoughts on North's performance, criticizing the influence of nepotism. One wrote, \"It needs to be said: North West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\" \"She’s cute and charming clearly, but it was just cruel to put her in a performance of that standard. People pay a lot of money to go to those shows they are entitled to criticize,\" another added. Despite the criticism, North is no stranger to the stage, having previously collaborated with her father, Kanye West, on various occasions. The father-daughter duo has performed together at album release events for Vultures 1 in Miami and Paris.",

(WFLA) — Officials made dozens of arrests over Memorial Day Weekend, including those driving- and boating under the influence. In a joint operation with the Florida Highway Patrol, Tampa police and Plant City police, officials in Hillsborough County conducted 367 traffic stops and 17 vessel stops. Within those traffic stops were 38 DUI’s, 34 citations, and 333 warnings. A 58-year-old man, Jose Eyngonesz Castillo, was arrested and charged with a DUI and refusal to submit to testing on Sunday afternoon after he was caught driving the wrong way on North 50th Street in Tampa. Out on the water, the Marine Unit made 17 stops resulting in two BUI arrests, 26 warnings and 10 citations. “Our deputies have made substantial DUI and BUI arrests over Memorial Day weekend, demonstrating our commitment to keeping Hillsborough County safe,” Sheriff Chad Chronister said. “It’s never okay to drink and drive, and if you do, be assured that we will catch you, and you will face the consequences. We are here to protect our citizens and ensure everyone can enjoy the holiday responsibly and safely.” The sheriff’s office said they continued their heightened patrol throughout Monday.",

        "content": "The first new Sublime song in 28 years has been released, and it features the band’s late frontman Bradley Nowell via outtakes. As Rolling Stone reports , the band released “Feel Like That (featuring Bradley Nowell)” on Friday. The song is the first from the band since Nowell passed away in May of 1996 due to a heroin overdose, and you can check it out below. Sublime broke up before they made it big, with their self-titled studio album (and major label debut) releasing two months after Nowell died. That album because a megahit, selling over 5 million copies in the US and spawning 1990s alt rock themes “What I Got,” “Santeria,” “Wrong Way,” and “Doin’ Time.” The band had already broken up following Nowell’s passing and have not released new music since. They reunited in December of 2023 with Nowell’s son Jakob having joined as singer; they also played with Jakob at Coachella and have additional tour dates going forward. Jakob also performs on “Feel Like That,” as does Scott Woodruff of reggae band Stick Figure. The track is built from a jam session in early 1996 that led to an improvised song that bootleggers originally named “Eireen.” “My dad has a verse and then I have a verse and then Stick closes out the song,” said Jakob of the song. He said of having the opportunity to collaborate with his father, “It’s a beautiful thing.”",

Tony Ferret arrived moments after the weapons struck — killing at least 18 people. The landscaper, 34, a volunteer in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, was having a coffee nearby when he heard the explosion at Epicentr — Ukraine’s equivalent of B&Q. He got into his military ambulance and pushed cars out of the way for trucks to reach the blaze in Kharkiv on Saturday. Tony, of Rye, East Sussex , said: “I heard the strike, saw the smoke and got in the vehicle. “We tailed over here as fast as we could and saw mass panic. People running everywhere. “I used my 4x4 to push vehicles out of the way. I just wanted to help where I could. “I don’t have a specific role here. I’m a humanitarian. I basically get involved where I can. “I wanted to come and do something good. I couldn’t eat or sleep in England . The people of this country need our help.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said as many as 200 people were in the shop when it was hit. At least 45 people were wounded. Tonight, Russia’s bombardment of Kharkiv continued with a glide bomb attack on a residential building which killed one and injured 11. Tony was among the first on the scene.",

        "content": "CARLO ANCELOTTI'S son Davide is being eyed by Stade Reims, according to reports. The coach has been assistant manager at Real Madrid under the tutelage of his father since 2021. He has helped Los Blancos win LaLiga this season and could win the Champions League for a second time this weekend. Davide attained his Uefa Pro License last year and could be set for his first ever managerial job. That's because Stade Reims believe he could be the right man to replace Will Still, according to RMC Sport . The Ligue Un club want to hold talks with Davide after the Champions League final. Reims also considered Le Havre boss Luka Elsner as a possible replacement for Still, who left the club earlier this month. Still dreams of managing in the Premier League and was linked with a move to Sunderland in December. Davide, 34, could be the right man to succeed the Englishman as he has plenty of experience coaching. He also worked under his dad at Bayern Munich , Everton and Napoli, where he often overlooked training sessions. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S By Martin Blackburn AFTER eight glorious years of stability, Manchester City now head into an uncertain 12 months. And Saturday’s FA Cup final defeat to neighbours United was a reminder that this glittering and unforgettable era will not go on for ever. Around this time in 2025, City will be preparing for the highly-lucrative Fifa Club World Cup in the US. Yet in all likelihood they will also be getting ready to say their goodbyes to manager Pep Guardiola, who has brought so much success to the east side of Manchester. Meanwhile, there could be a verdict on 115 charges of financial irregularity which have been levelled at the club by Premier League chiefs. The suggestion is the hearing could start later this year but is likely to take several months to reach a conclusion. City continue to deny any wrongdoing and are confident they will be cleared by the independent commission. Read Martin Blackburn's full column here. Davide has been hailed as Madrid's \"bad cop\" in the past. He was credited with a plan to beat Chelsea in last season's Champions League in which he wanted his team to use the \"dark arts\".",

        "content": "CARLO ANCELOTTI'S son Davide is being eyed by Stade Reims, according to reports. The coach has been assistant manager at Real Madrid under the tutelage of his father since 2021. He has helped Los Blancos win LaLiga this season and could win the Champions League for a second time this weekend. Davide attained his Uefa Pro License last year and could be set for his first ever managerial job. That's because Stade Reims believe he could be the right man to replace Will Still, according to RMC Sport . The Ligue Un club want to hold talks with Davide after the Champions League final. Reims also considered Le Havre boss Luka Elsner as a possible replacement for Still, who left the club earlier this month. Still dreams of managing in the Premier League and was linked with a move to Sunderland in December. Davide, 34, could be the right man to succeed the Englishman as he has plenty of experience coaching. He also worked under his dad at Bayern Munich , Everton and Napoli, where he often overlooked training sessions. BEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKER S By Martin Blackburn AFTER eight glorious years of stability, Manchester City now head into an uncertain 12 months. And Saturday’s FA Cup final defeat to neighbours United was a reminder that this glittering and unforgettable era will not go on for ever. Around this time in 2025, City will be preparing for the highly-lucrative Fifa Club World Cup in the US. Yet in all likelihood they will also be getting ready to say their goodbyes to manager Pep Guardiola, who has brought so much success to the east side of Manchester. Meanwhile, there could be a verdict on 115 charges of financial irregularity which have been levelled at the club by Premier League chiefs. The suggestion is the hearing could start later this year but is likely to take several months to reach a conclusion. City continue to deny any wrongdoing and are confident they will be cleared by the independent commission. Read Martin Blackburn's full column here . Davide has been hailed as Madrid's \"bad cop\" in the past. He was credited with a plan to beat Chelsea in last season's Champions League in which he wanted his team to use the \"dark arts\".",

        "content": "Nigeria’s SubseaRobotix in collaboration with TSC Subsea, has moved to transform subsea engineering inspections in Nigeria through the deployment of advanced robotic solutions. The Global Sales Director and the Marketing Manager in charge of Europe and Africa, of TSC Subsea, a global leader, ROV-deployed robotic underwater inspection technology, Jonathan Bancroft and Michel Bezemer, respectively were in Lagos recently to visit their Nigerian partners, SubseaRobotix. While explaining the rationale behind the visit and the partnership, the Chief Technology Officer of SubseaRobotix, Nigeria, Bello Salihu, who received the TSC Subsea team in Lagos along with Mr Wale Olagundoye, the Sales Director of SubseaRobotix, explained via a statement made available to The PRIMANEWS on Friday, that the partnership with TSC Subsea is to provide solutions for their Nigerian clients who have subsea and deepwater engineering assets beyond the reach of divers and require robotic technology to inspect. Salihu, a fellow of the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing and a veteran of subsea asset integrity campaigns worldwide, said, “Our partnership with TSC Subsea avails our clients in Nigeria with ROV-developed robotic Advanced Non-Destructive Testing (ANDT) solutions for the integrity inspection of subsea engineering assets.” The head of the visiting team, TSC Subsea’s Global Director of Sales, Jonathan Bancroft, emphasised the strategic importance of Nigeria to TSC Subsea and the alignment of their solutions with the increasing demand for robotic inspections in West Africa. According to him, the partnership avails Nigerian clients with remote-operated vehicles and deployed Advanced Non-Destructive Testing solutions for the integrity inspection of subsea assets. He stated, “A huge thank you to our hosts and partners at SubseaRobotix for a great week of customer visits and good company. “Nigeria is an important strategic region for TSC Subsea, and with the uptick in subsea robotic inspection in West Africa, our solutions are a perfect fit. We look forward to a long and rewarding partnership. “The challenges faced by oil and gas operators, especially those with deepwater operations, necessitate driverless solutions and non-human intervention. “Our robotic solutions and TSC Subsea’s proprietary technologies are designed to address these challenges efficiently,” he said. While highlighting the prospects of the collaboration, Wale Olagundoye, Director of Sales at SubseaRobotix, expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the various meetings held during TSC Subsea’s visit. Olagundoye stressed, “We are very happy with the outcomes of the various meetings held with our potential clients when we received our partners, TSC Subsea, in Nigeria. “The action-packed week with back-to-back meetings with the operators was better than we anticipated. At SubseaRobotix, making a difference in the subsea inspection space in Nigeria is our primary focus, and it is great having TSC Subsea, an accomplished global player in this sector, in our corner,” he added. On his part, Marketing Manager for Europe and Africa at TSC Subsea, Michel Bezemer, pointed out that the benefits of face-to-face meetings with local asset owners in Nigeria were a strategic move to improve their presence in Africa. “Visiting the local asset owners in Nigeria allowed us to discuss in detail their inspection challenges and the solutions TSC Subsea has in their services portfolio to strategically solve them,” Bezema stressed, adding, “It is always a great opportunity to have open discussions during face-to-face meetings and solve a challenge on-the-spot with our bespoke Subsea robotic ANDT offerings. The extreme challenges of deep and ultra-deep assets in West Africa are the perfect fit for the TSC Subsea and SubseaRobotix partnership.” Our correspondent reports that through the partnership, SubseaRobotix and TSC Subsea are poised to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of subsea inspections in Nigeria, ensuring safer and more reliable operations for the oil and gas industry.",

        "content": "The Special Forces Command (SFC) have watered down claims that Brig. Gen Charity Bainababo lacks people management skills, describing the allegations as baseless and unfounded. “Our attention has been drawn to an article written by ChimpReports on one of our General Officers titled “Murmurs as SFC’s Brig Bainababo is Sent on Course in Jinja”.Having carefully analysed the article, it’s noted that, the story lacks the basic tenets of news writing in its entirety as it was only meant to dent the image of the Officer and there is no iota of truth in what has been written,” the SFC Public Information Officer, Maj. Jimmy Denis Omara said in a statement dated 27th May, 2024. According to Maj. Omara, it is true Brig. Gen. Bainababo has been sent to the National Defence College for further studies but this is a normal routine in the Uganda People’s Defense Forces (UPDF). Gen. Bainababo has been the Deputy Commander of SFC. “UPDF is a disciplined force and no Officer is above the law. There is nothing like sending an officer for a course when they have done something wrong or broken the army’s code of conduct,” he said. “The article makes other allegations but none of the mentioned officers has ever raised a complaint against the General for the army to take any disciplinary action of any kind.” Maj. Omara added that Brig Gen. Bainababo is not the first to be sent for course and the article is an attempt to undermine her credentials as a progressive lady officer. “We condemn in the strongest terms this kind of writing and we call upon the media body to investigate the motive behind this article.”",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- An industry-first study by global ecommerce accelerator, Pattern, has shown that despite their surging popularity, Australian consumers hold negative views on the quality of the products sold on emerging marketplaces Temu and Shein. The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers' perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. \"Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn't rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,\" said Merline McGregor , General Manager of Pattern Australia. \"With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells. This is an area where Amazon leads the sector at 58%, with eBay trailing at 39%, followed by Catch (25%), Kogan (19%) and MyDeal (11%).\" Marketplaces attract shoppers as cost-of-living pressures bite As cost-of-living pressures rise, Australian consumers are increasingly turning to marketplaces to research, compare, and purchase. A large majority of Australians shopped on a marketplace in 2023, with a staggering 94% planning to buy from platforms like Amazon, Catch, and eBay over the coming year. \"With strained household budgets, marketplaces are attracting an increasing number of shoppers with their easy-to-use price comparison functionalities and sales events. With its globally recognised Prime Day event gaining popularity in Australia , Amazon has become the leading marketplace for value-for-money purchases, attracting 48% shoppers, followed by eBay at 41% and Catch at 27%,\" said McGregor. Not only are marketplaces attracting higher volumes of shoppers, but they are more likely to secure high income shoppers in 2024. Today, over 80% of $200K earning households shop on Amazon. Even newer marketplaces like Shein attract high income consumers, with 34% of those in the $160 - $199k household income bracket buying from the platform in the past 12 months. Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon's Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform's advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia , 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process - significantly more compared to any other single marketplace. Brands need to be present on platforms with biggest product ranges Just over 60% of Australian shoppers believe Amazon has the widest product range, followed by eBay at 52%. All other platforms lagged – Catch, 20%, Temu, 17%, Kogan 14%, Shein, 11% and MyDeal 8%. Offering the most product variety and options also buys marketplaces the highest web clicks, with Amazon averaging 75.2 million monthly site visits and eBay 50.9 million. \"It's no surprise there's a direct correlation between marketplaces perceived to have the best product ranges and those platforms, like Amazon, that attract the highest volumes of web traffic. Brands need to be present where their shoppers are. While the larger marketplaces may have more competition, they also have the biggest audiences of potential shoppers to target,\" concluded McGregor.

Responses were collected online, and the survey was restricted to adults who had shopped online in the previous 12 months ensuring there was a representative sample of age, gender and location achieved.

        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games combined with the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers and the Boston Celtics. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. ... \"It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with Boston in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, Memorial Day is a \"day of remembrance to honor all those who died in service to the U.S. during peacetime and war.\" The Department of Defense states that Memorial Day is not the same as Veterans Day: \"While Memorial Day honors those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, Veterans Day — November 11 — celebrates the service of all veterans. The day is largely intended to thank living veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all who served — not only those who died — have sacrificed and done their duty.\" A number of social media users criticized the two representatives, such as conservative political commentator Gunther Eagleman, who wrote, \"Should Ilhan Omar be representing Americans in ...?

A dirty war between sticker companies has seen Panini - who have lost the deal to publish UEFA's Euros album - block American-owned rival Topps from printing stickers of stars such as Phil Foden , Bukayo Saka , and John Stones in the official UEFA album. But that has led Topps to bulk out the England pages of their own album with uncapped players like Leicester City full back Luke Thomas and Manchester City 's Rico Lewis, who has just one cap. The bizarre use of these players has been known about for weeks - but many parents and children are only now discovering that hundreds of stickers have no relevance to the tournament, which starts on June 14. Christopher Abbott, who is collecting with his son Fionn, said: 'It's been disappointing and just an exercise in making you fork out for pointless stickers. Parents have hit out at a Euro 2024 sticker album 'rip-off' with collections incomplete A dirty war between Panini and Topps has led to uncapped players being included Rico Lewis (top right) and Leicester's Luke Thomas are both included on England's pages 'With the England players, you only get their heads - not the players in kit - but you're being asked to collect some of them several times over, for a separate \"captain\", \"artist\", \"player to watch\" and \"star player\". 'You don't realise that you're being asked to collect players like Luke Thomas and Rico Lewis because they don't print the names in the album, only on the stickers.' Panini have also struck back at Topps by publishing their own album, featuring only England, France, Italy and Germany - with which they have tie-ups - plus Spain. Children are being asked to collect five stickers of each England player - including AC Milan's Fikayo Tomori, who is not in the squad. Panini's five-sticker packs are 90p. Statisticians estimate it will cost £1,000 to fill both albums, factoring in the many doubles. Panini have even done a deal with M&S to make a third Euros album, which costs £3 and is food and lifestyle-related. Mr Abbott said: 'Fionn is only four so it's a novelty for him but if he were a bit older, he'd want to collect the Panini album too - because they have proper England players. I can get away with it this time as he just wants to tear the packets open. 'I'm finding so many additional Topps stickers which are pointless. There are no managers and no shiny sticker. It's obviously a money-making exercise.' Panini blocked Topps from printing stickers of the likes of Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka Statisticians estimate it will cost £1,000 to fill both albums, factoring in the many doubles Panini would not reveal which players they have deals with and have even blamed Topps Jean Fletcher, who is helping her eight-year-old, Eva, to collect, said that Eva only realised her favourite England players were missing when she'd bought dozens of Topps' six-sticker packets, which cost £1. 'It's a rip-off,' said Mrs Fletcher. 'Eva's ended up with dozens of players who won't be at the Euros because there are pages for Luxembourg, Israel and other countries no one's interested in. Her friend is collecting the Panini album which only has five countries in it.' Industry insiders say players missing altogether from Topps' albums have individual commercial deals with Panini. Panini would not reveal to Mail Sport which stars they have deals with - and even blamed Topps for leaving England stars out. Panini said: 'We have always acquired rights from a multitude of partners aimed at producing the best possible products for our collectors.' Meanwhile, Topps say they are infuriated by Panini's tactics. They told Mail Sport : 'We are disappointed that a small number of players are missing. This is due to the tournament's former sticker partner having blocked certain parts of the collection to the detriment of the fans.' Industry insiders say the war between the firms could hit the Premier League's album, which Topps have acquired the rights for from the 2025-26 season.

Bellingham, 20, who has enjoyed a stellar first season at the Bernabeu and will go to the Euros this summer as England’s key man, was speaking at Real Madrid’s pre-final media day at their lavish Valdebebas training complex on the outskirts of the Spanish capital. He has already helped lead the club to the La Liga title this season, scoring 19 league goals in a number 10 role in which he has shone and when he spoke to the hundreds of media who had flocked to the training ground, he talked with the same impressive maturity that has marked all his media appearances. ‘It’s definitely special,’ Bellingham said. ‘But I think the preparation has to be the same as it is for every game. It’s important to be me, and not to worry too much about the emotional side. Jude Bellingham has been dreaming of playing in a Champions League final his whole life This is the celebration Real Madrid fans hope to see against Borussia Dortmund on June 1 ‘I’m really excited. The final is a game I’ve been dreaming of since I started playing football. 'I understand the opportunity and I don’t want to waste a second. It’s a game I’ve dreamed of all my life. It would be stupid now to get here and want to hide away from the occasion.’ Bellingham said he had not spoken to any of his former team-mates in Germany recently but had swapped texts with Dortmund’s on-loan Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho some time ago and told him he would see him in the final.

Last week the Rangers midfielder marked his goal in the 3-3 draw with Hearts by posting a celebration picture and a caption which read: ‘Shushburger please’ accompanied by a laughing face emoji. After being reminded by supporters of the Ibrox club that he still had a Scottish Cup final to play in, the Englishman deleted the original message before posting it again without the caption. This was referenced by several Celtic players after their dramatic win over Rangers at Hampden completed the league and cup double. Left-back Greg Taylor’s Instagram account featured a picture of Celtic celebrating with the trophy. Team-mate Alistair Johnston replied, asking Taylor if he would be ‘eating a burger tonight wee man??? Johnston’s remark was ‘liked’ by team-mates including Taylor and Saturday’s matchwinner Adam Idah. Brown, above, made a thinly-veiled reference to Todd Cantwell and his use of social media Cantwell, above right, and Celtic's Greg Taylor were involved in a spat during cup final Cantwell and Taylor had some words on the pitch after a shoving match In a clear reference to Cantwell, Brown claimed that his old team-mates had an extra edge going into the final because of the extra ammunition the former Norwich City man gave them. ‘There’s a lot of people talk in the press and talk on social media, and do all their TikToks and YouTube stuff or whatever it is,’ said Brown, now manager of Ayr United. ‘The good thing about our club (Celtic) is that they do their talking on the park, and they continue to do that. ‘It’s not about outside, it’s about the focus that is inside the football club and the mentality to keep going day to day.’ Taylor also felt Cantwell’s conduct on the park was poor after a tangle between the pair in the second half, saying: ‘He said a few things that I didn’t like.’ Share or comment on this article: BROONY BLASTS TODD: Scott Brown takes a swipe at Todd 'TikTok' Cantwell by saying Celtic players prefer to do their talking on the park e-mail Add comment",

        "content": "Completion of what has been dubbed the \" world’s largest hydrogen refuelling station \" has been moved further down the road. Hydra Energy spokesperson Katherine Arnett confirmed Monday that its refuelling station and hydrogen production facility is now slated to be open by fall 2026. It had previously been scheduled for completion by early this year . \"Hydra's flagship refuelling station in P.G. is still on track, and while our team has made a lot of progress the reality is that the project requires a few long lead items and new requirements from BCER (BC Environmental Review) that have slowed down the schedule,\" Arnett said in an email. Specifics on the new requirements were not provided. \"We are still very positive and see no problems with the station moving forward. Hydra has been very fortunate to receive a warm welcome in the Prince George community and look forward to working with fleets in the region soon,\" Arnett added. The $62-million facility will be located on five acres at the intersection of Sintich Road and Northern Crescent and is to produce 3,250 kilograms of hydrogen per day and refuel as quickly as diesel and up to 24 converted trucks each hour across four bays. The station's low-carbon hydrogen is to be produced from two on-site, five-megawatt electrolyzers with electricity coming from BC Hydro. In March 2023, Hydra signed up eight fleets adding up to 80 heavy-duty trucks to long-term purchasing agreements.",

        "content": "Rachel Reeves will pledge on Tuesday to lead the most “pro-growth” Treasury in UK history if Labour wins the general election. Addressing business leaders, the shadow chancellor is poised to claim her party would “return to the centre ground of politics” by striking a balance between workers’ needs and business interests. She is also expected to say she is committed to delivering economic stability so that “families and businesses can plan for the future” without the risk of “a repeat of the mini-budget”. Labour will instead “offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”. In a swipe at Rishi Sunak, Reeves will say the timing of the snap election was a damning indictment of his economic plans: “If he really believed his plan was working, he wouldn’t have called an election now.” She is expected to tell business chiefs: “The general election in five weeks’ time is a chance for the British people to pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives. “Fourteen years of chaos that have seen taxes reach a 70-year high. National debt more than double. And the average mortgage holder having to pay £240 more a month after Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget.” Her words will strike the same tone as the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, who said that claims from Sunak that the UK has turned the corner were “a form of disrespect in itself”. On Monday evening it was also reported that 121 business leaders have leant their support to Labour in a joint letter signed by former executives from JP Morgan, Heathrow, Aston Martin and JD Sports – as well as the Wikipedia founder, Sir Jimmy Wales, and Tom Kerridge, the chef and restauranteur . “We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe it is time for a change,” said the letter to the Times, which was also signed by the founder of the childcare company that Akshata Murty, the prime minister’s wife, previously held shares and the Iceland founder Sir Malcolm Walker, who in 2015 publicly backed the Conservatives. “For too long, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation and a lack of long-term focus.” Reeves’s speech comes as the shadow chancellor seeks to strike a political balance between the views of businesses and trade unions. Her refusal to rule out all fire-and-rehire employment practices has drawn criticism from union leaders in recent days. The Unite union’s secretary general, Sharon Graham, said Labour’s plans – which exclude an outright ban on the practice – had “more holes than Swiss cheese”. Reeves has since said that the plans still amount to the “biggest ever extension of workplace rights that’s ever been introduced” and that fire-and-rehire would only be tolerated in extreme circumstances such as a company going bankrupt. She also faces further challenges in the coming weeks to illustrate how she can promise to keep a tight hand on the public finances while also rejuvenating ailing public services with fresh investment. Reeves has promised that Labour will not oversee a “ return to austerity ” as she ruled out increases to income tax or national insurance. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: “There’s not going to be a return to austerity under a Labour government. We had austerity for five years and that is part of the reason why our economy and our public services are in a mess today.” Reeves added that the party would raise money to fund its pledges by introducing VAT on private school fees, increasing tax on private equity bonuses, extending the windfall tax on energy companies’ profits, and cracking down on non-doms and tax avoidance.",

        "content": "( WGN Radio ) – Injectable GLP-1 medications, like Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy and Zepbound, have been the subject of a lot of excitement – some of it earned, some of it thanks to myths circulating about these so-called wonder drugs. The class of drugs, which either contain semaglutide or tirzepatide, started as ways to treat diabetes, explained Dr. Sterling Elliott, a clinical pharmacist at Northwestern Medicine and assistant professor of orthopedics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Now, there are versions of the medications that are FDA-approved for weight loss and to treat obesity. While these types of treatments are more accessible than they have been in years prior, one misunderstanding about them is that they’re easy to get, Elliott said. A month’s supply costs around $1,000 without insurance. Patients may have luck getting insurance to cover one of the drugs if it’s being prescribed to treat diabetes, but those who want to use the medication for weight loss tend to have more trouble getting coverage . “As we’re looking at these, we’re watching our patients have difficulty navigating through those issues,” said Elliott. Another issue is limited availability. Almost all dosages of the four brand names are listed as “currently in shortage” by the FDA . Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company behind Zepbound and Mounjaro, told NBC News supply issues could last into 2025. Perhaps the biggest myth of all surrounding the drugs is that they can work miracles for weight loss, without changes to diet or exercise habits. “I think no matter what you do to lose weight, diet and exercise – healthy diet and good, solid exercise – are always going to be staples of weight loss,” Elliott said. “These drugs will help you start your way on that process. But if you don’t change your habits, you’re not going to stay that way very long.” Listen to Dr. Elliott’s full interview with WGN Radio in the audio player below. Studies have found that many of those who stop using the weekly injections regain much of the weight they lost.",

        "description": "Walton touched many lives here, and he was part of one of the greatest teams in NBA history.",
        "content": "The memories and stories started pouring in as soon as the new broke. Everyone remotely connected to the 1985-86 Celtics has a Bill Walton memory. Invariably, those stories are personal. And all of us were shocked Monday when it was learned that Walton had died in California at the age of 71. No player ever loved playing for the Celtics more than Walton. And it’s cruel and ironic that Bill would pass as the team is on the cusp of another appearance in the NBA Finals, which would mean a chance to win an NBA-record 18th banner. My friend Rich Johnson, longtime curator of the New England Sports Museum and — like Walton — someone with a lifelong stutter, weighed in online, sending out a recording of the Grateful Dead’s “He’s Gone,” while writing, “Listening while wiping away tears. His personal kindness to me was life changing.” Advertisement Bill touched a lot of lives in his short stint in Boston, and those of us lucky enough to have known him share the same emotions. Just one year younger than Walton, I became aware of him when he took over at center for the UCLA Bruins in 1971 and started winning NCAA championships. As sports fans in New England, we followed Walton from afar when he broke into the NBA and won his first championship with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977, and then the MVP in 1978. Early in his pro career, he was clearly the best passing big man in the history of the sport. A lot of forgettable, frustrating seasons followed. A legitimate 7-footer who always claimed he was 6-11 (he thought being 7 feet tall made him freakish), Walton had bad bones in his feet and could not stay on the court long enough to maximize his seemingly infinite potential. As a result, he underachieved with the Blazers and Clippers. There was little demand for his services when he came to Boston in the autumn of 1985 in exchange for a wounded, declining Cedric Maxwell. Advertisement And then, 1985-86 happened. The Celtics enjoyed one of the greatest seasons in league history (including playoffs, they went 50-1 at home), destroying all competition en route to the franchise’s 16th championship. In his magical season, Walton was given a gift of health, playing a career-high 80 games and winning the NBA’s Sixth Man Award. But it was more than that. When Walton teamed with Larry Bird, we saw nightly passing clinics — stuff “Hoosiers” coach Norman Dale would have loved. It was basketball ballet. Give-and-go. Pick-and-roll. The picket fence. And don’t get caught watchin’ the paint dry. Bill was basketball’s Baryshnikov, enjoying a Faustian favor bestowed by the parquet gods. The California flower child (Kevin McHale accused Walton of having harbored Patty Hearst, but Bill said he never met the fugitive/heiress) became the favorite son of hardscrabble Gallery Gods in the old Boston Garden. Decades later, during the pandemic, while working on a book about that Celtics season, I called Bill to ask about 1985-86, and he said, “When you’re part of something that special, it changes you. You spend the rest of your life trying to get that back. When you’re doing it, it seems like it’s going to last forever. When it ends, you realize how fragile, how tenuous, and how fleeting it all is.” Advertisement None of us who were there will ever forget Walton’s first Celtic game. Playing in New Jersey, the Celtics blew a 19-point lead to the atrocious Nets and committed 28 turnovers in a 113-109 overtime loss. Walton scored 4 points in 19 minutes, committing five fouls and seven turnovers. He was hard on himself after the game. “We play a million of these games, and this was just another one, and we knew we were OK,” McHale remembered. “But Bill was really taking it hard. All of a sudden, he stood up and said, ‘I’d like to apologize to all of you for losing the game tonight. I was a disgrace to the game of basketball.’ “None of us had ever heard anything like it, and Larry just snapped at him and said, ‘I sure as hell hope we play better, because I can’t stand hearing this 81 more times. Go have a beer and forget about it.’ ” Walton did just that, and it ended up being one of the greatest seasons in NBA history. “It was better than perfect,” Walton told me in 2021. “It was just such a joy. It was what you dream about and I wish it lasted forever.” Unfortunately, it did not last even another year. Bill’s feet gave out on him for good in 1987 and he retired. In recent years, we stayed in touch, and I started sending him an annual Happy New Year message. Advertisement Some Walton responses: “Thanks. Shine on. Happy Everything Forever. Here we go.” “Shine on. Write on. Create on. Carry on.” “Once in a while you get shown the light. In the strangest of places if you look at it right” (Grateful Dead). “I’m the luckiest guy in the world. BW, from the bright side of the road.” Walton’s optimism was infectious. When I came home from the hospital in February after complex heart surgery, there was a text from Bill on my phone: “Please get better soon ... Good health. Good everything, forever. We have lit our votive candles ... Heal on.” Last Friday, we had one final exchange. The online version of a Rick Carlisle story I’d written included a photo of Carlisle alongside Danny Ainge and Larry Bird at City Hall Plaza after the Celtics won in ‘86. There was a little boy in the photo, standing directly under Bird’s left elbow. It was clearly one of Bill’s four sons. Unaware that he was gravely ill, I texted Walton, offering, “Hope all is well,” then asking which of his boys was in that photo. “Adam, oldest, now 48,” he texted, adding, “Larry was always so nice.” I thought maybe I’d reach out to him again once the Finals got underway. Too late. Shine on, my friend. We are all better for having known you. Dan Shaughnessy is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at daniel.shaughnessy@globe.com . Follow him @dan_shaughnessy .",

        "description": "The policy would mean that for pensioners, both the state pension and their tax-free allowance will rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5 per cent every year. The post Rishi Sunak vows tax cut for pensioners with ‘triple lock plus’ appeared first on Politics.co.uk.",
        "content": "The Conservatives have promised to cut taxes for pensioners by creating a new “age-related” tax-free allowance. The party has announced plans to increase the personal allowance for pensioners in line with the triple lock by introducing the new age-related allowance. The policy would mean that for pensioners, both the state pension and their tax-free allowance will rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5 per cent every year. At present, people can receive £12,570 a year of their pensions before they start paying income tax on them, the same figure as the personal allowance for those who work. Featured BASC responds to general election announcement Featured Jersey votes to legalise assisted dying ***Politics.co.uk is the UK’s leading digital-only political website, providing comprehensive coverage of UK politics. Subscribe to our daily newsletter here .*** According to the party, this new “triple lock plus”, introduced from from April 2025, would amount to a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners next year, and almost £300 a year by the end of the next parliament. Rishi Sunak said the move “demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners”, and would bring people “peace of mind and security in retirement”. The Conservative Party has already stated its commitment to the “triple lock”, which sees the state pension rise by either the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5 per cent in April each year — whichever is highest. On current forecasts, the state pension is expected to rise by £430 next April, and by around £1,700 a year by the end of the parliament. The Conservatives have said the new triple lock plus policy will cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30 and be funded through the party’s plan to raise an extra £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. It is the second policy in recent days to have the majority of its funding drawn from this measure after the National Service scheme, which was announced over the weekend. Rishi Sunak unveils plans for mandatory national service to inspire ‘pride in our country’ Commenting on the new announcement, Rishi Sunak said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ Triple Lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year.” He added: “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride said: “A Conservative government is the only one which can provide pensioners the peace of mind in retirement they deserve. “Labour’s record speaks for itself. The last Labour government waged an all-out assault on pensioners, with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and an insulting 75p increase to the state pension. “Sir Keir Starmer can pay lip service to pensioners until he’s blue in the face, but we know it will always be the same old Labour, putting our pensioners at the back of the queue.” Responding to the announcement, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years? “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.” Also responding, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP said: “Rishi Sunak’s stealth tax hikes will blow a £1,000 hole in pensioners’ pockets by 2027, over four times more than what he is giving back with this meagre announcement. “The Conservative Party has hammered pensioners with years of unfair tax hikes and broken their word on the triple lock. People won’t be fooled by yet another empty promise from Rishi Sunak after this record of failure. “Liberal Democrats are proud we brought in the triple lock and will continue to stand up for the millions of pensioners who have been so badly let down by this Conservative government.” Politics.co.uk is the UK’s leading digital-only political website, providing comprehensive coverage of UK politics.

        "content": "RISHI Sunak last night promised OAPs a boost of almost £2,000 a year if he is re-elected. It comes from guaranteeing the Triple Lock and raising their tax allowance, with the full benefit felt by 2029 — giving “peace of mind and security”. The financial sweetener, which will raise the point at which pensioners begin to pay income tax, will kick in from next April in an attempt to shore up their core vote. It will put Labour under pressure to match the five-year £2.4billion spending commitment. The Prime Minister said that people must have “peace of mind and security in retirement”. Proposals to be included in the party’s manifesto will see both the state pension and allowance go up by the triple lock — whichever is highest out of the rate of inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent. The forecast rise in the state pension will be £1,677 a year by 2029, with the tax-free allowance worth £275 a year by then. Next year alone the average pensioner will see their state pension increased by £428 and the income tax cut will be worth £95. The PM added: “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners.” The proposal comes after Mr Sunak was criticised over his treatment of pensioners after the Government twice cut National Insurance — which OAPs don’t pay. But Labour seized on Budget remarks by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt that the Tories will eventually abolish National Insurance, claiming it will create a £46billion black hole in funding earmarked for the state pension and NHS . The Tories also plan to guarantee in legislation that OAPs’ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the state pension. Party insiders say that by 2027/28, at the current rate, the state pension will be £12,578. The tax-free allowance is now £12,570. Without action, it would mean the elderly having to go through a red-tape headache of filling out a self-assessment form. Funding for the new Tory plans will come from a previously announced proposal to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion. Welfare Secretary Mel Stride said: “Only a Conservative government can provide pensioners with the peace of mind they deserve. “Labour’s record speaks for itself. The last Labour government completely failed pensioners, with a £118billion pensions tax raid and an insulting 75p increase to the state pension. “ Sir Keir Starmer can pay lip service to supporting pensioners but we know it will always be the same old Labour, putting our pensioners at the back of the queue.” Labour tonight said it remained committed to the triple lock. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has also said income tax or National Insurance will not rise under a Labour government. Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth said tonight: “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years? “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46billion policy to scrap National Insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.” Ms Reeves will today tell business leaders that she will bring growth back to Britain to help working people. She will say Labour will offer “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”.",

        "content": "SIR Keir Starmer made his big pitch yesterday, insisting he has “permanently” changed the Labour Party. As a result he claims he can now be trusted with national security. It’s a very public acknowledgement that he still has a lot of work to do to win over unconvinced voters. Four years ago he sat silently in the Shadow Cabinet as his leader Jeremy Corbyn swore never to fire Britain’s nuclear weapons. Now he’s pledging a “100-day review” to assess what’s needed to keep us safe. We can save him the time. The threats are: reckless dictator Putin , scheming China , North Korea, Iran , Hamas , IS , unchecked illegal migrants and international organised crime gangs. Add to that home-grown Far Right, Northern Irish and Islamist terrorism. What people really need to know is whether Labour is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. The party’s failure to say it will commit to Rishi Sunak’s plans to spend £75billion on defence means any promise it makes to protect Britain is in danger of sounding like hot air. Sir Keir’s short-term ambition is to kick out the Tories on July 4. But where it leaves the security of the country on July 5 is still not wholly clear. RISHI Sunak yesterday offered what he believes is clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour. His offer on pensions is designed to shore up wavering older voters. A boost rising to almost £2,000 by 2029 for OAPs backs up years of action to protect their income and assets. Coupled with his surprise pledge on National Service , it’s clear the PM is aiming at his core vote. Both are welcome ideas. What is needed now are new policies to help younger voters and new families. We hope Rishi has something up his sleeve to solve the desperate housing shortage , which is pricing young people out of home ownership. As it stands, many see no reason to even consider voting Tory. Let’s see what the PM can do for them, too. AFTER a Spring washout and the soggy beginning of a so far less-than-exciting election campaign, weather experts are now predicting 50 days of summer rain. We just pray favourites England can bring us some sunnier cheer at the Euros next month. With our forward line of superstars, there’s no fear of a goal drought. So if our defence can avoid making heavy weather of it, surely the Three Lions can take the tournament by storm.",

        "content": "One day, there will be entire libraries filled with psychological studies of how broken the American left has become, and almost all of it due to their hatred of one man. Yep, you guessed it: THE BAD ORANGE MAN. The latest breathtaking display of Trump Derangement Syndrome comes to us from former federal prosecutor Jim Zirin, via The Hill: \"Who will hang next week, Trump or the jury?\" ( @TheHillOpinion ) https://t.co/z90SNU88Ka Yes, you read that correctly. The Hill and Zirin just suggested that former President Donald Trump could hang for ... giving hush money to a porn actress (that even the federal government decided was not worthy of prosecution). And just in case you think this was just some random low-level headline writer, think again. The author himself tweeted out the same op-ed with the same headline. Proudly. My latest piece in The Hill. Who will hang next week, Trump or the jury? https://t.co/CWpwW92Xow (We are laughing that he has had that tweet out all day with absolutely zero engagement. Talk about screeching into the void.) Zirin is a permanent TDS victim. His entire Twitter timeline buys into every false accusation you can think of about Trump and it oozes with unhinged hate. You will not be surprised to learn that he has also fully bought into the Justice Sam Alito flag 'scandal.' Because of course, he is. But back to the op-ed. We won't bore you with the contents of the article. You can read it here if you want , but it is everything you'd expect it to be. The evidence is OVERWHELMING. Michael Cohen (despite being a convicted perjurer who admitted he stole from Trump) is a TOTALLY credible witness. Blah, blah, blah. We get it. You hate him, Jim. And you are completely incapable of objective analysis. But 'hang'? Really? We don't need to ask what would happen if a conservative politician or commentator said something even CLOSE to this. We know from experience. Hahah, remember when Sara Palin got dragged for crosshairs on a map? https://t.co/hduNlSfoMw Yep. We're old enough to remember that. Palin showed a map of Congressional districts she was targeting for victory in the next election and it was a 24/7 media crisis with its own theme music. But The Hill can suggest a President hang for barely even a misdemeanor and ... crickets. Would @thehill even think about writing this type of headline if it was Obama? No, but Orange Man Bad so let's write whatever. https://t.co/s2ZA9sG1tJ Saint Obama? Never. Besides, we're pretty sure that The Hill considers him -- as most gods are -- to be immortal. Hoo boy https://t.co/toxA61pTH3 Honestly, we waited a little while to write this because we thought for sure that The Hill would delete the tweet and/or rewrite the headline. But nope. They are totes cool with it. What the Hell is wrong with you? https://t.co/Q3k16UxRlF Our first thought is: many things. How long you got? We are being punked people This can’t be reality https://t.co/sjm56Ikqxf Sadly, we rubbed our eyes and even pinched ourselves. It wasn't a dream. It was a real headline. The is sending their message to the jury. Convict or face riots. https://t.co/EIMfTb8hbA Of course everyone knows the Trump jury will stay away from all forms of news, right? No pressure. https://t.co/cgLZTQ4YUu Judge Merchan did not sequester the jury over the holiday weekend, which is simply ridiculous. So, yes. The jury will indeed likely see a headline suggesting Trump could (and should) be hung. Hopefully, that will only galvanize opposition to conviction among a few sane members of the jury, but we're not counting on it. Pretty sure any other random account would get suspended for posting this. https://t.co/IOGbnuIXfq This is unquestionably true. And Burt Macklin knows whereof he speaks. He's an FBI agent, after all. Why is journalism dying? Beats me https://t.co/gtClFSkZrk If y'all ever wonder why the normal people hate journalists, it's headlines like this. We're shocked ... SHOCKED that media credibility is in the toilet and that most Americans side with Trump when he calls the press 'the enemy of the people.' The US media is not biased 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/FkGENtiTCG Biased is one thing. This is downright disgraceful. I thought New York didn’t have the Death Penalty, are they waving that for Trump? It would be on brand I guess New York DID just fine the man more than $400 million for the horrendous crime of ... overvaluing his property. On a loan that he paid back on time and in full. There is nothing out of bounds for that state when it comes to its leaders' hatred of Trump. Reported for threats of violence, an obvious violation of TOS. It would be hilarious and glorious if Twitter locked The Hill and Zirin out of their accounts for the headline, but we're not holding our breath for that to happen either. This headline is suggesting a former president should be hung. It’s more likely to incite violence than anything Trump said regarding J6. The media is getting increasingly reckless with these headlines and it’s blatant attempts to rile people up if Trump is not found guilty. Sounds like 'stochastic terrorism' to us. This headline... pic.twitter.com/m5EzFPGEyp Holy schlit!! This guy is a former federal prosecutor and admits there is no way Trump got an unbiased jury in NYC. I missed his article on why this is a travesty of justice if you believe Constitutional guarantees apply to all citizens... What do you expect when we have elected officials like Sandy Cortez BRAGGING that the trial is preventing Trump from campaigning? They're not just not hiding the corruption anymore. They are actively celebrating it. That's a rather inappropriate headline. And the Understatement of the Year Award goes to ... Look, we get it. Ziring was trying to be clever with wordplay. He failed. But sorry, leftists. Conservatives don't play by the old rules anymore. Not too long ago, Trump said that there would be an economic 'bloodbath,' specifically in the auto market, if Biden won re-election. The media proceeded to undergo a week-long collective paroxysm of outrage claiming that he was inciting violence. They even lied and chopped up his words to fuel their false narrative. Welp. You created these new rules. You have to play by them. And by your rules, The Hill, Jim Zirin just called for the execution of a former president. And that is why no one ever takes them seriously. Or ever will.",

        "content": "NINE out of ten burglaries went unsolved in some parts of the country last year, police figures reveal. Some communities saw massive rises in break-ins not busted by the cops with just six per cent of cases leading to a person being charged. Police failed to catch three in four burglars across the UK in 2023 as reports soared to 215,000 - the equivalent of 592 a day. However in some areas, the rate of unsolved smash-and-grab hits was much higher than the average. Leafy Elmbridge, in Surrey, had the worst record in the country as 92 per cent of burglary reports probed by police were dropped without a suspect being nicked. Some 91 per cent of burglaries went unsolved in South Cambridgeshire, while 90 per cent of cases went unsolved in Runnymede, also in Surrey. The figures were compiled by FOI requests to police forces across the UK by the Liberal Democrats. It comes as party leader Sir Ed Davey will today pledge to launch a Burglary Response Guarantee as part of his manifesto. Sir Ed said: “Too many families now feel unsafe in their own homes because this Conservative Government has decimated frontline policing for too long. “Victims are being denied justice because Conservative ministers can’t even get the basics right on solving crime . “That is why the Liberal Democrats would deliver a Burglary Response Guarantee, to ensure all home burglaries are attended by the police and properly investigated.” Surrey Police and Cambridgeshire Police were asked to comment. Tory Policing Minister Chris Philp hit back by branding the Lib Dems \"cynical\" and claiming they \"do not have a plan\" to tackle crime. He added: “A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party.\"",

        "content": "As old have gotten new leases on life in recent years, more and more people have just wanted to know why Friday the 13th can’t get the same treatment. While the series was kept semi-alive with a video game not too long ago, there hasn’t been a new movie since the 2009 reboot. It sounds like even with the recent plans to launch a , it’ll be some time before Mr. Voorhees is back on screen, though not entirely for the reasons you think. At the recent Texas Frightmare Weekend, series co-creator Sean Cunningham was asked point blank what the holdup was with another Friday flick. Instead of pointing a finger at the franchise’s infamously weird rights issues, he speculated the biggest obstacle is fear on the studio’s end. He doesn’t point a finger at any specific company, but he did say whichever studio could get the ball rolling likely doesn’t want to put substantial money into a project that “might not see a huge return on its investment.” As far as he’s concerned, there won’t be another movie for “at least” three years. He went on to say movie-watching habits have changed due to the pandemic, which isn’t entirely false. Despite the performance of decent-sized hits like and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, not all box offices are equal. After The Fall Guy came out in early May, Universal recently put it on streaming while it’s still currently running in theaters. In the pandemic’s fairly early days, Warner Bros. and Disney elected to do same-day streaming with some movies like Mortal Kombat and Raya & the Last Dragon, which would make for good bragging with streaming numbers, but hit-and-miss in terms of box office performance. That being said, big horror movies tend to do fairly well in theaters. Despite mixed or negative reviews, Tarot, The Strangers: Chapter One, and Night Swim have done solid in the box office. New Line, which owns the Friday the 13th trademark, is also the studio behind Evil Dead Rise and The Nun II, which both made their money back and then some last year. It’s not clear what makes Friday the 13th an outlier, ditto why it’s got such a weird streak of bad luck behind it. Until that hypothetical new movie gets greenlit, Jason fans will have to comfort themselves with the Jason Universe: the Friday video game remains playable through the end of the year, and Jason himself is a playable character in , which launches next week.

        "content": "IT is a truth universally acknowledged that ­Manchester United cannot possibly decide Erik ten Hag’s future on the basis of a single match. But why not? Why not, when that single match saw them win football’s grandest domestic knockout competition by defeating the best team on the planet, thanks to their manager’s tactical acumen. There is no doubt that Ten Hag would have been sacked had — as expected — United lost Saturday’s FA Cup final to Manchester City . But United did win 2-1 at ­Wembley . Ten Hag did outwit Pep Guardiola by setting up his side without a centre-forward. And United did look a ­half-decent team once they had a couple of fit first-choice central defenders — as the Dutchman always argued they would. So why shouldn’t Sir Jim ­Ratcliffe change his mind on the basis of all that? Isn’t winning silverware what football is about? The vast majority of United fans would have preferred a trophy to Champions League qualification, given a straight choice. And we cannot spend several months talking up the magic of the FA Cup, only to brand the identity of the winners as irrelevant come May. Of course, United’s campaign has been poor overall — a worst-ever eighth-place Premier League finish , a negative goal difference and finishing bottom of their Champions League group. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS United’s players admitted their season hadn’t been good enough in an unusual joint statement. The managerial situation would be different if Ratcliffe, United’s new football supremo, had a clear vision for the club’s future, with a successor to Ten Hag identified and readied for arrival. Instead, Ratcliffe and Co have been sounding out every Tom, Dick and Harry — from Mauricio Pochettino to Kieran McKenna to Thomas Tuchel to Thomas Frank to Roberto De Zerbi . Gareth Southgate and Graham Potter are also highly-regarded among the collection of green-fingered executives currently on gardening leave at rival clubs before arriving at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Ten Hag, with two trophies in as many seasons, is left swinging in the wind. There is no bus parade for Erik, just a long wait on a sunbed for the likely arrival of the Spanish archer. Only Manchester United could manage to win a major trophy in impressive style and finish the weekend looking a complete ­shambles. But that is where we are thanks to Ratcliffe and Co managing to look simultaneously heartless and hopeless in their treatment of Ten Hag. There was no name-check for the manager in the Ineos billionaire’s triumphant post-final statement. Just as there has been no backing for Ten Hag in the five months since Ratcliffe purchased a 27.7 per cent stake in United and took over their footballing operation. Ten Hag was admirably strident in his post-match ­comments after the final. He has taken a huge amount of flak all season, from ex-players in TV studios and the likes of me, so why not give some back? To paraphrase — if United don’t want him, he’ll go somewhere else and win trophies as he’d always done; Roy Keane failed as a manager (a brave thing to say to Keane’s face) and the club was a mess when he arrived. All fair points, well made. And while no manager ever wants to rely on the sympathy vote, Ten Hag certainly gained the sympathy of a vast swathe of United supporters this weekend — as a winner, who is being openly ­disrespected by his bosses. Sir Jim and his new regime were welcomed as liberating heroes by United fans in mid-season — just as anyone lessening the influence of the Glazers would have been. Yet he has torched much of that goodwill with his shabby handling of Ten Hag’s future. The pros and cons of Ten Hag’s reign have been well argued. His first season was good, his second season was ravaged by an injury crisis, especially in defence. But the £85.5million signing of Antony has been a disaster, the handling of Jadon Sancho — who will contest Saturday’s Champions League final on loan at Borussia Dortmund — is an embarrassment, while United have too often lacked an attacking gameplan. Still, despite such a dismal league campaign and despite so many issues remaining within the squad, United have been presented with a chance to make a genuine challenge for the Premier League title before long. After his arrival, Ratcliffe made a ballsy statement about wanting to ‘knock City and Liverpool off their perch’, which was met with widespread derision. But the exit of Jurgen Klopp from Anfield, and Guardiola’s likely departure from the Etihad next summer, will allow the rest of the Premier League’s wealthiest contenders to hold more realistic title ambitions. The opportunity is there for Ratcliffe as long as he identifies the right manager. And could that manager be the bloke who has just won him the FA Cup? By Neil Custis SIR JIM RATCLIFFE looked more than a little shame-faced when he headed into Manchester United’s dressing room to congratulate his FA Cup winners. The plan had already been hatched ahead of Saturday’s 2-1 win over Manchester City . . . and this was all rather awkward. It was a stunning performance from Ten Hag’s troops and United’s triumph over a team widely regarded as the best in the world will live long in the memory. It was also a personal triumph for the unassuming guy who had arrived at Old Trafford full of life and ideas to make United better — which in many ways he has. Having been dealt a dreadful hand with injuries in his second season, he tried to explain to Ratcliffe and his team just how much this has affected performances. But it seems Sir Jim hasn’t listened. Nor has he taken notice of the way Ten Hag has carefully brought Saturday’s scorers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo into the first team — with spectacular results. Ratcliffe has fired out emails criticising the state of an office, called the club museum ‘crap’ and withdrew travel and lunch benefits for United staff on FA Cup final day to cut costs. There is early proof the new men overseeing United’s football department do not know what they are doing, not least in the way they deal with people . . . including the most important one of all — the manager. Ratcliffe and his team seem to have spoken to anyone able to set up Subbuteo. And everyone they have spoken to believes they have got the job. Read the full column from Neil Custis here AFTER Leeds’ defeat by Southampton in the Championship play-off final, there will be fewer northern clubs in the top flight next season than at any time in English league football history. The Manchester clubs, Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle will be the only five northern sides — as opposed to 11 from the south and four Midlands clubs. Former top-flight regulars such as the Sheffield clubs, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Blackburn, Burnley, Bolton, Stoke, Wigan and Hull have been wiped off the Premier League map. With northern clubs outside the three major footballing cities struggling to attract the wealthiest owners — and therefore the best players — there is little prospect of any ‘levelling up’ in football’s north-south divide. SPARE a thought for Daniel Farke, who is facing the sack at Leeds , despite accumulating 90 points and leading his team to third place and a narrow play-off final defeat. Especially given the career trajectories of the two managers who pipped him to promotion - Leicester’s Enzo Maresca is heading for Chelsea , while Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna attracted interest from the Stamford Bridge club as well as Manchester United and Brighton. And that’s without even mentioning relegated Burnley boss Vinny Kompany taking over at Bayern Munich. SHOULD Jack Grealish make the England squad for the Euros? Of course he should. Not because Manchester City’s £100million man would get much game time. But because, if Gareth Southgate ’s men win the tournament, nobody would be more fun than Grealish on an open-top bus parade. ANDY MURRAY’S straight sets first-round French Open defeat against his fellow veteran Stan Wawrinka has increased calls for the three-time Grand Slam winner to call it a day. If Murray still enjoys playing professional tennis at the age of 37 and without any realistic hope of recapturing former glories, then that is his absolute right.",

        "content": "IT is a truth universally acknowledged that ­Manchester United cannot possibly decide Erik ten Hag’s future on the basis of a single match. But why not? Why not, when that single match saw them win football’s grandest domestic knockout competition by defeating the best team on the planet, thanks to their manager’s tactical acumen. There is no doubt that Ten Hag would have been sacked had — as expected — United lost Saturday’s FA Cup final to Manchester City . But United did win 2-1 at ­Wembley . Ten Hag did outwit Pep Guardiola by setting up his side without a centre-forward. And United did look a ­half-decent team once they had a couple of fit first-choice central defenders — as the Dutchman always argued they would. So why shouldn’t Sir Jim ­Ratcliffe change his mind on the basis of all that? Isn’t winning silverware what football is about? The vast majority of United fans would have preferred a trophy to Champions League qualification, given a straight choice. And we cannot spend several months talking up the magic of the FA Cup, only to brand the identity of the winners as irrelevant come May. Of course, United’s campaign has been poor overall — a worst-ever eighth-place Premier League finish , a negative goal difference and finishing bottom of their Champions League group. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS United’s players admitted their season hadn’t been good enough in an unusual joint statement. The managerial situation would be different if Ratcliffe, United’s new football supremo, had a clear vision for the club’s future, with a successor to Ten Hag identified and readied for arrival. Instead, Ratcliffe and Co have been sounding out every Tom, Dick and Harry — from Mauricio Pochettino to Kieran McKenna to Thomas Tuchel to Thomas Frank to Roberto De Zerbi . Gareth Southgate and Graham Potter are also highly-regarded among the collection of green-fingered executives currently on gardening leave at rival clubs before arriving at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Ten Hag, with two trophies in as many seasons, is left swinging in the wind. There is no bus parade for Erik, just a long wait on a sunbed for the likely arrival of the Spanish archer. Only Manchester United could manage to win a major trophy in impressive style and finish the weekend looking a complete ­shambles. But that is where we are thanks to Ratcliffe and Co managing to look simultaneously heartless and hopeless in their treatment of Ten Hag. There was no name-check for the manager in the Ineos billionaire’s triumphant post-final statement. Just as there has been no backing for Ten Hag in the five months since Ratcliffe purchased a 27.7 per cent stake in United and took over their footballing operation. Ten Hag was admirably strident in his post-match ­comments after the final. He has taken a huge amount of flak all season, from ex-players in TV studios and the likes of me, so why not give some back? To paraphrase — if United don’t want him, he’ll go somewhere else and win trophies as he’d always done; Roy Keane failed as a manager (a brave thing to say to Keane’s face) and the club was a mess when he arrived. All fair points, well made. And while no manager ever wants to rely on the sympathy vote, Ten Hag certainly gained the sympathy of a vast swathe of United supporters this weekend — as a winner, who is being openly ­disrespected by his bosses. Sir Jim and his new regime were welcomed as liberating heroes by United fans in mid-season — just as anyone lessening the influence of the Glazers would have been. Yet he has torched much of that goodwill with his shabby handling of Ten Hag’s future. The pros and cons of Ten Hag’s reign have been well argued. His first season was good, his second season was ravaged by an injury crisis, especially in defence. But the £85.5million signing of Antony has been a disaster, the handling of Jadon Sancho — who will contest Saturday’s Champions League final on loan at Borussia Dortmund — is an embarrassment, while United have too often lacked an attacking gameplan. Still, despite such a dismal league campaign and despite so many issues remaining within the squad, United have been presented with a chance to make a genuine challenge for the Premier League title before long. After his arrival, Ratcliffe made a ballsy statement about wanting to ‘knock City and Liverpool off their perch’, which was met with widespread derision. But the exit of Jurgen Klopp from Anfield, and Guardiola’s likely departure from the Etihad next summer, will allow the rest of the Premier League’s wealthiest contenders to hold more realistic title ambitions. The opportunity is there for Ratcliffe as long as he identifies the right manager. And could that manager be the bloke who has just won him the FA Cup? By Neil Custis SIR JIM RATCLIFFE looked more than a little shame-faced when he headed into Manchester United’s dressing room to congratulate his FA Cup winners. The plan had already been hatched ahead of Saturday’s 2-1 win over Manchester City . . . and this was all rather awkward. It was a stunning performance from Ten Hag’s troops and United’s triumph over a team widely regarded as the best in the world will live long in the memory. It was also a personal triumph for the unassuming guy who had arrived at Old Trafford full of life and ideas to make United better — which in many ways he has. Having been dealt a dreadful hand with injuries in his second season, he tried to explain to Ratcliffe and his team just how much this has affected performances. But it seems Sir Jim hasn’t listened. Nor has he taken notice of the way Ten Hag has carefully brought Saturday’s scorers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo into the first team — with spectacular results. Ratcliffe has fired out emails criticising the state of an office, called the club museum ‘crap’ and withdrew travel and lunch benefits for United staff on FA Cup final day to cut costs. There is early proof the new men overseeing United’s football department do not know what they are doing, not least in the way they deal with people . . . including the most important one of all — the manager. Ratcliffe and his team seem to have spoken to anyone able to set up Subbuteo. And everyone they have spoken to believes they have got the job. Read the full column from Neil Custis here AFTER Leeds’ defeat by Southampton in the Championship play-off final, there will be fewer northern clubs in the top flight next season than at any time in English league football history. The Manchester clubs, Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle will be the only five northern sides — as opposed to 11 from the south and four Midlands clubs. Former top-flight regulars such as the Sheffield clubs, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Blackburn, Burnley, Bolton, Stoke, Wigan and Hull have been wiped off the Premier League map. With northern clubs outside the three major footballing cities struggling to attract the wealthiest owners — and therefore the best players — there is little prospect of any ‘levelling up’ in football’s north-south divide. SPARE a thought for Daniel Farke, who is facing the sack at Leeds , despite accumulating 90 points and leading his team to third place and a narrow play-off final defeat. Especially given the career trajectories of the two managers who pipped him to promotion - Leicester’s Enzo Maresca is heading for Chelsea , while Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna attracted interest from the Stamford Bridge club as well as Manchester United and Brighton. And that’s without even mentioning relegated Burnley boss Vinny Kompany taking over at Bayern Munich. SHOULD Jack Grealish make the England squad for the Euros? Of course he should. Not because Manchester City’s £100million man would get much game time. But because, if Gareth Southgate ’s men win the tournament, nobody would be more fun than Grealish on an open-top bus parade. ANDY MURRAY’S straight sets first-round French Open defeat against his fellow veteran Stan Wawrinka has increased calls for the three-time Grand Slam winner to call it a day. If Murray still enjoys playing professional tennis at the age of 37 and without any realistic hope of recapturing former glories, then that is his absolute right.",

        "description": "PENSIONERS will be given a tax break worth £2.4 billion a year, Rishi Sunak is expected to promise ...",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4bn a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5bn a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6bn a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. READ MORE: SNP to stand 'shoulder-to-shoulder' with Waspi women, says John Swinney For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories , and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46bn policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

        "content": "SIR Keir Starmer made his big pitch yesterday, insisting he has “permanently” changed the Labour Party. As a result he claims he can now be trusted with national security. It’s a very public acknowledgement that he still has a lot of work to do to win over unconvinced voters. Four years ago he sat silently in the Shadow Cabinet as his leader Jeremy Corbyn swore never to fire Britain’s nuclear weapons. Now he’s pledging a “100-day review” to assess what’s needed to keep us safe. We can save him the time. The threats are: reckless dictator Putin , scheming China , North Korea, Iran , Hamas, IS, unchecked illegal migrants and international organised crime gangs. Add to that home-grown Far Right, Northern Irish and Islamist terrorism. What people really need to know is whether Labour is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. The party’s failure to say it will commit to Rishi Sunak’s plans to spend £75billion on defence means any promise it makes to protect Britain is in danger of sounding like hot air. Sir Keir’s short-term ambition is to kick out the Tories on July 4. But where it leaves the security of the country on July 5 is still not wholly clear. RISHI Sunak yesterday offered what he believes is clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour. His offer on pensions is designed to shore up wavering older voters. A boost rising to almost £2,000 by 2029 for OAPs backs up years of action to protect their income and assets. Coupled with his surprise pledge on National Service, it’s clear the PM is aiming at his core vote. Both are welcome ideas. What is needed now are new policies to help younger voters and new families. We hope Rishi has something up his sleeve to solve the desperate housing shortage, which is pricing young people out of home ownership. As it stands, many see no reason to even consider voting Tory. Let’s see what the PM can do for them, too. AFTER a Spring washout and the soggy beginning of a so far less-than-exciting election campaign, weather experts are now predicting 50 days of summer rain. We just pray favourites England can bring us some sunnier cheer at the Euros next month. With our forward line of superstars, there’s no fear of a goal drought. So if our defence can avoid making heavy weather of it, surely the Three Lions can take the tournament by storm.",

        "content": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas on Monday urged the 36 state governors to support President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his commitment towards granting full autonomy to the local government areas in the country. Abbas made the call at the National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and Good Governance at the Local Government Level organised by the House of Representatives in Abuja. The speaker recalled that the federal government recently filed a legal action against the usurpation of local government functions by the sub-national governments. He said the decision was indicative of Tinubu’s determination to correct the anomalies in the system to encourage speedy development at the local government level, stressing that the House has also made frantic efforts through various legislative interventions to arrest the situation. While lamenting the challenges facing the local governments, he assured that the House is committed to making the local government administration function optimally according to their mandate. Abbas represented by Deputy Speaker Benjamin Kalu said, “The failure of local government is well known to us. Despite the extensive provisions of the 1999 Constitution regarding the existence and functions of local governments, that tier of government has failed to live up to its billing. “Some of the most significant challenges impeding their ability to fulfil their constitutionally assigned roles include the covert usurpation of local government functions by state governments, a lack of financial autonomy due to the State Joint Local Government Account, political instability from tenure irregularities, and pervasive corruption. “A critical component of the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda is the integration of local governments into the mainstream of governance in Nigeria. In a significant move, the Federal Government recently instituted legal action against the governors of the 36 states at the Supreme Court, addressing alleged misconduct in the administration of Local Government Areas (LGAs). “This action underscores the President’s profound commitment to this issue, one he is intimately familiar with from his tenure as Governor of Lagos State. “We in the 10th National Assembly are determined and committed to ensuring local governments are recognised and sufficiently empowered to perform their constitutionally assigned roles. As contained in our legislative agenda, the House will continue to play a crucial role in advocating for and enacting the necessary legislative frameworks to ensure that local governments are granted the autonomy they rightfully deserve. “This is not just a legislative duty but a commitment to the democratic aspirations of the Nigerian people and the Constitution. For this reason, I call on all governors to put Nigeria first and collectively support the president in the quest to grant full autonomy to local governments. We must definitively resolve the controversy surrounding the status of local governments by providing the framework needed to ensure their optimal operation. “Let me reassure you that the outcomes of this national dialogue will receive the full attention of the House and its Committee on Constitutional Amendment.” Also speaking at the summit, Deputy Speaker Kalu represented by the House Leader, Hon. Julius Ihonvbere regretted that non-state actors are taking advantage of ungoverned spaces in the local government areas to make life unbearable for people in rural communities. “History often takes unexpected turns. Like a once-mighty warrior whose shield has grown rusty, our local governance system has faltered. The gaps in service delivery are wide, and the very people who need them most—our rural citizens—are suffering. This, in turn, has fueled social unrest and violence, creating fertile ground for those who seek to exploit instability. “As many political analysts and development experts have noted, the near absence or complete breakdown of governance at the local level has created ungoverned spaces. “These spaces have been exploited by non-state actors, making life increasingly unbearable for our rural populace. This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for reform and revitalization at the grassroots level. “Efforts to address these issues through constitutional amendments by the 7th, 8th, and 9th National Assemblies were not successful. Various reasons have been cited for these failures, but what remains clear is that the situation has continued to deteriorate without effective alternative measures being put in place,” Kalu said. “Specifically, we aim to discuss the bottlenecks inhibiting effective governance at the local government level, ascertain the extent to which weak governance contributes to insecurity and other developmental challenges, galvanize public action for improved governance and service delivery at the subnational level, leverage ongoing reforms like the debate on state police and the constitution amendment exercise, and build national consensus on the most appropriate strategies for strengthening local government governance.",

        "content": "by: Travis Schlepp Posted: May 27, 2024 / 02:29 PM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 02:29 PM PDT The ocean was closed off to all beachgoers in San Clemente Monday after officials confirmed “aggressive shark behavior” just off the coast. The sharks were spotted near T-Street Beach, according to a social media post by the City of San Clemente. Officials did not elaborate on the number of sharks spotted or what led to their behavior being deemed “aggressive.” Water access was set to be closed to the public through at least 8 p.m. Monday night, assuming no new shark sightings. Video from Sky5 showed many people continuing to enjoy Memorial Day at the beach despite the warnings. Several people were seen wading into the water. A December 2022 study found that there were some 201 “confirmed shark incidents” in state waters between January 1950 and December 2021. Fifteen of those encounters were fatal and another 107 involved non-fatal injuries. Fish and Wildlife officials say the only way to avoid any risk of having a shark encounter is to avoid the ocean altogether. But while humans have greatly increased their beach and ocean activity, including surfing, swimming and scuba diving, shark incidents have not increased at the same rate.

        "content": "Lizzo is sounding off after South Park referenced her in their special episode spoofing weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. South Park: The End of Obesity , streaming now on Paramount+, follows foul-mouthed Cartman after he recruits Kyle, Stan, Butters and Kenny for help when he is denied access to a weight-loss drug. According to USA Today , after he learns his insurance won’t cover Ozempic to help him drop pounds, Cartman is made aware of a drug called Lizzo. “Insurance companies only cover the medication for diabetes, not for weight loss, so if you can’t afford them, you’re just kind of out of luck,” the doctor says. Instead, he writes Cartman “a prescription for Lizzo.” “She’s a really good singer who talks about body positivity and just being happy with the way you look,” the doctor quips. “I want you to listen to Lizzo five times a day and watch her videos just before bedtime. Oh, and I’m afraid you’ll have to be on Lizzo for the rest of your life.” “FDA-approved Lizzo makes you feel good about your weight, and it costs 90% less than Ozempic. ... In case studies, 70% of patients on Lizzo no longer cared how much they weighed,” a voiceover in a fake commercial for the drug says on the show, continuing the joke. “Lizzo helps you eat everything you want and keep physical activity to a minimum.” Following the gag, Lizzo posted a video to Instagram and TikTok , “Guys, my worst fear has been actualized. I’ve been referenced in a South Park episode. I’m so scared.” But the Grammy winner went on to call the segment “crazy” as she said she was proud she was namedropped by the animated show. “I just feel like, damn, I’m really that bitch. I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f— to the point where these men in Colorado ( South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone) know who the f— I am and put it on their cartoon that’s been around for 25 years. I’m really that bitch and I show you how to not give a f— and I’ll keep showing you how to not give a f—.” The South Park bit comes after Lizzo was accused last year by some of her former dancers of harassment and fat shaming. Last summer’s court filing claimed that after performing a concert in Amsterdam, Lizzo and her crew attended a sexually themed show at a club in the city’s notorious Red Light District where “Lizzo (allegedly) began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers.” During the show, Lizzo allegedly led a chant pressuring one dancer to touch the breasts of one of the nude women performing at the club, the filing states. “Plaintiffs were aghast with how little regard Lizzo (allegedly) showed for the bodily autonomy of her employees and those around her, especially in the presence of many people whom she employed,” the complaint stated. Lizzo was also accused of calling out one performer for her weight gain. The About Damn Time singer has denied the allegations. mdaniell@postmedia.com",

Emergency services were called to the banks of the Cook River in Earlwood, southwest Sydney , at about 4.30pm on Monday after a passerby walking a dog spotted a placenta and an umbilical cord. The 'evidence of birth' were later confirmed by police to be human. Search teams, boats and divers returned to the river at first light on Tuesday after a large-scale search of the river and surrounding areas was conducted overnight. When asked whether police were concerned the day-old baby could be in the water, Detective Chief Superintendent Christine McDonald said the whereabouts of the mother and child was her main priority. 'At this stage our main concern is for the whereabouts for the mother and the child, we see that as a real urgent matter for us to find her and her child, hopefully safe and healthy,' she told a press conference on Monday night. Police have responded to fears a newborn baby could be in the Cook River in Sydney's southwest after a passerby walking a dog spotted 'evidence of birth' at 4.30pm on Monday A placenta and umbilical cord found on the riverbank was confirmed by police to be human Superintendent McDonald said it remained unclear whether the child was born on the banks of the Cook River or elsewhere. 'All we know is that a placenta and an umbilical cord were located. Obviously, our search will identify what has taken place,' she said. 'Whether that birth or delivery of that child occurred at this location, or another location, is yet to be determined.' Police have urged the mother and child to present at a hospital and said they do not need to speak to police if they don't want to. 'It is very important, and it is extreme urgency that we find the mother and child as soon as we can. Obviously, we will be contacting hospitals, we ask that she goes to a hospital,' Superintendent McDonald said. 'If any family and friends have any information, our request is that she gets to a hospital as soon as possible.' Superintendent McDonald said it remained unclear whether the child was born on the banks of the Cook River or elsewhere as the mother and child are urged to present to hospital Detectives are hopeful a busy walking track near the riverbank will mean there are witnesses who may have seen the mother and child. Police are also seeking CCTV footage from Lang Road, Wardell Road, Ewen Park or Tennent Parade in Earlwood, about 10km southwest of Sydney's CBD. 'That's why we are appealing for information overnight and tomorrow morning when people are hearing the news that this placenta and umbilical cord have been located,' Superintendent McDonald said on Monday. 'There's lots of houses and businesses in this area, and we do hope that someone will have CCTV footage, anyone that may have seen a pregnant woman or a woman in distress.' As inquiries continue police are urging anyone with CCTV vision or information about the incident to contact Burwood Police or Crime Stoppers.

        "content": "Kendall Jenner and her former flame Bad Bunny have sent tongues wagging once again after their recent rendezvous in Miami, Florida. The pair, who sent shockwaves through their fanbase with a surprise reunion at a Met Gala after-party in New York City earlier this month, were spotted together as they made a discreet exit from their luxury hotel. Eager paparazzi caught glimpses of the duo as they followed each other through the hotel's parking garage, with a handler dutifully carting their luggage. Despite attempts to keep a low profile, Kendall and Bad Bunny were seen slipping into the back of the same car, under the watchful eye of a security guard. Their reunion comes amidst whispers of a rekindled romance, following their split in December 2023, just before the holiday season. Fueling further speculation, the model has been a consistent presence at Bad Bunny's recent concerts in Miami, making appearances at two out of three shows at the Kaseya Center. But it's not just concerts that have brought these two back into each other's orbit. The pair has been spotted enjoying intimate dinners, including a visit to hiss own restaurant, Gekko, and plans for a leisurely lunch at Grutman's Casadonna restaurant on Sunday. Jenner stepped out sporting a chic ensemble as she attempted to shield herself from prying eyes.",

        "content": "LUTON ace Ross Barkley flaunted his shredded abs as he took to the beach in sunny Barbados with girlfriend Katherine Pilkington. The Premier League star , 30, played the doting boyfriend - carefully applying sun cream on the stunning blonde’s back as she soaked up the rays in a tiny monochrome bikini. Ross stopped to adjust his blue swim shorts - showing off his rugged physique in the process - as the loved-up couple took a stroll along the golden sands. Accounts executive Katherine, who counts Love Island’s Ellie Brown as one of her best friends, looked smitten during the romantic trip to the Caribbean island. The well-earned break comes as Aston Villa are reportedly in advanced talks to make Ross their first summer signing. Earlier this month, The Sun revealed the club has a ‘strong interest’ in signing the midfielder , who has also interested Manchester United , for a nominal fee of around £2 million Unai Emery has been impressed by the 33-times-capped England international's outstanding form this season on his return to the Premier League. SunSport understands Villa's President of Football Operations Monchi has a 'strong interest,' in signing Barkley, who has also interested Manchester United, for a nominal fee of around £2million. Although Barkley could not prevent the Hatters from dropping back into the Championship, he has excelled since joining them on a free from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The former Everton and Chelsea star scored five goals and assisted with four more in 32 appearances for Rob Edwards ' side. Villa need to trade wisely this summer as they struggle to comply with tough Profit and Sustainability Rules. And the addition of Barkley would be one of the shrewdest bargain-priced moves they could pull-off as they look to strengthen the depth of their squad for next season's Champions' League campaign. Emery admitted the club will need to \"be intelligent,\" in their transfer dealings this summer, after they ran up a loss of £119million in their last accounts - a Uefa record for the season. And with further losses forecast for last season the need to balance the books has never been more important. Landing Barkley would be seen as a coup for Emery who was impressed by the midfielder's stunning form last term.",

        "content": "LUTON ace Ross Barkley flaunted his shredded abs as he took to the beach in sunny Barbados with girlfriend Katherine Pilkington. The Premier League star , 30, played the doting boyfriend - carefully applying sun cream on the stunning blonde’s back as she soaked up the rays in a tiny monochrome bikini. Ross stopped to adjust his blue swim shorts - showing off his rugged physique in the process - as the loved-up couple took a stroll along the golden sands. Accounts executive Katherine, who counts Love Island’s Ellie Brown as one of her best friends, looked smitten during the romantic trip to the Caribbean island.

        "description": "A Massachusetts man who was mauled by a mother grizzly bear in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park provided details about the attack in an Instagram post with graphic photos.",
        "content": "A South Hadley man who was mauled by a mother grizzly bear while hiking off-trail in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park a week ago described the attack as “the most violent thing I have ever experienced,” in an Instagram post accompanied by gory photos of his injuries. Shayne Patrick Burke, 35, said he is a disabled veteran in the US Army Reserve, who has “experienced being shot at, mortared, and IED explosions,” but the ordeal on May 19 was his closest brush yet with mortality. “I accepted on that small hill top that I very well could die,” Burke wrote in the Thursday post. “I recorded a short video telling my people that I loved them.” Advertisement A National Park Service official confirmed Sunday that Burke is the man who survived a bear attack near Signal Mountain last weekend. Burke could not be reached for an interview Sunday. In his first public account of his near-death experience , Burke wrote, “I’ve thought long and hard about how I would share my story about my encounter with a female grizzly and her cub.” A post shared by Shayne Patrick (@n0beefstew4u) Burke said he loves and respects wildlife and pleaded with park rangers not to kill the bear. “She was defending her cub,” Burke wrote. “What happened up on Signal Mountain was a case of wrong place, wrong time.” Park officials have said the bear will not be killed or captured. Burke said he had set off that Sunday morning in search of great grey owls to photograph and was hiking through “a thick wooded area in a valley” in the backcountry when he spotted a small brown cub running up a hill about 50 to 70 yards away. He instantly removed his canister of bear spray from its holster, but the mother bear appeared and charged before he could deploy it. Advertisement “I stood my ground, shouted, and attempted to deploy the bear spray but as I did she already closed the gap,” Burke wrote. “When she pounced, I opted to turn and give her my back and I laid down in the prone position on my belly and braced for the ride, interlocking my hands behind my neck to protect my vitals.” The first bite and slash landed on his back and right shoulder, Burke said. He screamed. The bear stepped on his back, bit one of his legs, and then picked him up and slammed him on the ground multiple times, Burke said. The bear bit each leg about three times from his buttocks to his inner knees. Burke’s next scream, he said, drew the bear’s attention to his head. “I believe she went in for a kill bite on my neck,” Burke said. “I still had my hands interlocked and my arms protecting my carotid arteries. I never let go of the bear spray can.” When the bear bit Burke’s hands on the back of his neck, “she simultaneously bit the bear spray can and it exploded in her mouth,” Burke wrote. “This is what saved my life from the initial attack.” The bear ran away and Burke ran in the opposite direction, he said. Burke tried to call his wife, who was waiting for him in a parking lot. The calls wouldn’t go through, so he texted her: “Attacked.” Advertisement Burke’s wife called back as he applied improvised tourniquets to his legs using straps from his backpack, camera, and fanny pack, to slow the bleeding. She talked him through the process. “I laid alone in the woods, gripping my knife with my back to a tree, just hoping the bear wasn’t to return,” Burke said. “At this point, my legs were not really working.” While waiting for rescuers to fly to the scene, Burke recorded messages for his loved ones. A rescue team provided emergency medical care and took Burke by helicopter to an ambulance. He underwent surgery at St. John’s Medical Center in Jackson, Wyo., where they cleaned and stapled his wounds. “The number one thing that kept me alive during the attack was reading and understanding what to do in the event of a bear attack and being prepared with the bear spray,” Burke wrote. “Though I am not sure if I got to spray any at the bear,” Burke continued, “having it on me and keeping it in my hands while protecting my vitals, 100 percent is the only reason I am telling my story now.” Park authorities closed the 7,700-foot mountain to all hiking because of the attack. This is routine in the event of a bear attack. Rangers track and study the approximately 1,000 grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area, which includes Grand Teton National Park.

        "content": "Affiliate links for the products on this page are from partners that compensate us and terms apply to offers listed (see our advertiser disclosure with our list of partners for more details). However, our opinions are our own. See how we rate banking products to write unbiased product reviews. I've saved money in a high-yield savings account for more than a decade, opening my Capital One 360 account back when it was ING. I originally opened a savings account because of the higher-than-average APY at the time to set money aside as I was starting my financial journey. High-yield savings accounts typically pay at least 20 times the interest of a traditional savings account, and the best rates now are even higher. Over the years, I've refined my savings strategy. Here's how I maximize the value of my high-yield savings accounts. When I first started saving in my early 20s, I had one savings account. I wanted to have money set aside for emergencies or anything else I might need. I had a pot of cash in savings — let's say several thousand dollars — and yet, each month, it seemed like there was a reason to dip into my savings. Having one lump sum of cash didn't give me any clarity or goals for how I should use the money. So I constantly found reasons, some legitimate and some not, why I needed to tap my savings. I finally realized how ineffective this strategy was and branched out to targeted savings accounts. I realized that my bank allowed me to open up to 25 different savings accounts — and nickname them. I decided to get more specific regarding what my savings were actually for. So, I opened one account and named it \" Emergency Fund .\" I opened another account and named it \"Travel.\" A few years ago, I created a \"Moving\" savings account when I moved back to Los Angeles from Portland, Oregon. Being self-employed, I also have a \"Biz Taxes\" savings account, \"Vacation,\" and \"Sick as a Dog\" funds. I have to pay my own taxes, so I set aside more than 30% of each check toward business taxes . After my first year of self-employment, I realized how scary it was to get sick. I realized I felt worried on vacation. Why? Because being self-employed, I don't have any benefits. If I don't work, I don't get paid. When you're sick or on vacation, stressing about money is the last thing you should do. So, I decided to take action and fund my own benefits. Having a buffer of cash in case anything happens has given me peace of mind. I know that if I have to say no to certain assignments or take on less work because I'm not well or on vacation, I can do so and still pay my rent. Being hyper-specific about what each savings account was for gave me clarity and focus. No longer could I dip into these accounts and find a reason to use the funds. The goal was clearly stated, and I knew what it was for. Having separate accounts and naming them made saving much easier for me. Not only that, but it inspired me because I knew what I was saving for instead of just saving in general. Next Steps: Earn up to 5.26% on savings and up to 5.31% on CDs with Raisin. Earn up to 5.26% APY on savings and up to 5.31% APY on CDs with 25+ federally insured banks & credit unions. One account to maximize your savings. no monthly service fee up to 5.26% on savings and up to 5.31% on CDs $1 The first thing I did with each of my savings accounts was to figure out how much I wanted in each account. For example, I knew I wanted at least $10,000 in my emergency fund. For travel, I calculated prospective costs and the time I had to save. Once I had an idea of what I wanted to save, I managed those goals with Capital One 360, which used to allow you to set a goal for each account and see a progress bar. On top of that, I automated my savings every month so I had no excuses. Every month, I have a set amount that gets transferred from my checking account to my emergency and travel funds. Depending on my income that month, I'll manually transfer money to my Biz Taxes, Vacation, and Sick accounts at the end of the month. Automating some of my savings and setting up a money date at the end of the money to manually transfer more money keep me accountable to my savings goals. Being clear and specific with my savings goals has transformed my financial life for the better. I am more clear, focused, confident, and know exactly how each dollar is used. Not only that, but it has given me peace of mind to know that I have money in the bank and that I'm prepared for a variety of situations. I'm not just saving for emergencies, either — but the fun stuff, too. Having multiple savings accounts has helped me be financially well-rounded and save for what I need ... but also what I want.

        "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie Harrison was born in May 2019, but fans are still waiting for the little one to step out into the public eye.",
        "content": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's son, Archie, has largely remained out of the public eye since his birth in 2019. Despite his parents' frequent appearances in the media, both Archie and his sister Lilibet have been kept away from the limelight. Upon Archie's birth, Royal enthusiasts were quick to examine his publicly available birth certificate, where they noticed an unusual detail. The official document lists Harry as 'His Royal Highness Henry Charles Albert David Duke of Sussex', a title that notably omits 'Prince'. This omission puzzled many, especially considering that both William and Charles were referred to as 'Prince' on their children's birth certificates. On the birth certificates of Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, William is identified as 'His Royal Highness Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Duke of Cambridge'. Similarly, Charles was styled as 'His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George Prince of Wales' on the birth certificates of William and Harry. Archie's birth certificate also disclosed previously unknown information about his birth. It confirmed that Meghan delivered at London's private Portland Hospital, contradicting reports that she had chosen a home birth, reports the Express . On the document, Meghan is named as 'Rachel Meghan Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex,' and her occupation is listed as 'Princess of the United Kingdom'. The Royal twosome welcomed their firstborn, a boy, at 5.26am on Monday, May 6. Buckingham Palace said that Prince Harry was with his wife during the birth and further stated: \"The Duchess' mother, Doria Ragland, who is overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild, is with Their Royal Highnesses at Frogmore Cottage.\" Celebrations were in full swing on June 4, 2021, as Harry and Meghan greeted the arrival of their second offspring, a girl they christened as Lilibet Diana, in Santa Barbara. Fascinatingly, Harry opted to use his HRH title on the birth certificate, with 'HRH' displayed as his surname and his given name as 'The Duke of Sussex'. Meghan's official name is listed as her birth name, 'Rachel Markle', with Meghan designated as a middle name. This created a ripple of intrigue because earlier in 2020, the pair were notified that they were not permitted to apply their HRH titles following their decision to step away from Royal duties. During a fresh trip to Nigeria, Meghan disclosed some facts about her two little ones. On day one, the pair stopped by a school that had profited from kind donations from the Archewell Foundation, known as the Lightway Academy located in Abuja. The couple mingled with a group of kindergartners, who put on song and dance performances for them. Harry interacted with the pupils, asking: \"Is singing and dancing your favourite class? \" To this, Meghan added: \"That's Lili's favourite class, maybe it's all the jumping around.\" The Royal couple then proceeded to a STEM class where eager children took pride in showing off the robot cars they had assembled. During a school visit, Prince Harry engaged with students about their fascination with electronics, while Meghan Markle revealed that their son Archie shares a similar interest in construction. The Royal pair also broached the subject of mental health during their visit. This prompted Meghan to share a touching story about their daughter, Lilibet. Addressing the class, she said: \"We all have our story. And there's no shame in any single one of your stories. Even on the hardest days or darkest days, everything is a pillar of your strength by each of you being there. Your teachers see that in you. And we see that in you.\" She went on to say: \"And interestingly, so our daughter, Lili, she's much, much tinier than you guys. She's about to turn three. And a few weeks ago she looked at me and she would just see the reflection in my eyes.\"",

        "description": "The groups say money, political power, and even health could be at stake.",
        "content": "The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab, and Brazilian communities say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power, and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it’s about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. Advertisement The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics, and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the United States as a result of what became known as the “secret war.” By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and central California. Today, Hmong in the United States number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the United States, many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the US Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. Advertisement “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the US during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and chief executive of the St. Paul-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: The East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it’s first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents’ backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican, and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Advertisement Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora's culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations, and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many are likely to categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” Advertisement During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the United States , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the United States identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the United States, also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recorded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren’t counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a PhD. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. Advertisement “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.”",

        "content": "Lydia Jobst, who is 91 years young, must have been beaming after carding a hole-in-one at Shaganappi Point. The smooth-swinging senior drilled a driver on No. 12 and her aim was outstanding from 88 yards away. Ian Macdonald has made a habit of this. Macdonald notched his fourth career ace during a round at D’Arcy Ranch, draining a 140-yard dandy — a nifty nine-iron from 140 yards — on the signature third assignment. Scot Knutson was the toast of the clubhouse at Carnmoney after making a splash of another sort on the island green at the sixth. Knutson knocked a nine-iron and was right on the money from 146 yards out. Glen Barreth buried a beauty on the eighth hole at Douglasdale. Nine-iron was the right call for a 125-yard challenge. Haesookoh Oh was one-and-done on No. 3 at Shaganappi Point, finding the flag-stick with a superb seven-iron that travelled 126 yards. Troy Maryniak will be saying only good things about his nine-iron, his weapon of choice for a 140-yard memory-maker on No. 6 at Lakeside. Scott Arnold skipped the putting portion on the seventh at Earl Grey, instead finishing his business with one strike of a seven-iron from a distance of 149 yards. Also at Earl Grey, Stephen Park smoked a four-wood on No. 15 and then made the 190-yard commute to retrieve his ball from the bottom of the cup. Mike Ochs and Adam Reid can swap stories after both aced the sixth hole at D’Arcy Ranch. Ochs was accurate with an eight-iron from 190 yards away, while Reid selected that same stick from 182. Mike Ballem mastered the eighth hole at Maple Ridge thanks to a wicked wedge from the 125-yard blocks. Report the details of your ace to wgilbertson@postmedia.com",

        "content": "THREE drivers woke to find their cars missing, and assumed they were stolen - a simple error caused a flurry of drama. One disgruntled driver threatened a lawsuit if they weren't paid thousands. Two years ago, three Phoenix, Arizona homeowners found their cars missing from their usual places in front of their homes, prompting them to call the police to report a theft. Instead, they were shocked by the news that their cars were towed away after reportedly parking illegally. Michael Roberson, one of the three drivers, said he was \"befuddled\" as he'd been parking his BMW in the same spot for several years without issue. \"They told me that my car was illegally parked on the road after 10 p.m. - that it had been towed,\" he told ABC affiliate KNXV-TV . The company who towed the vehicles, Metro Towing and Impounds, initially tried to uphold the charges to the drivers before realizing what went wrong. \"First of all, [Metro] wanted to charge us the towing fee to get the car back,\" said Roberson. \"Then they said, 'Okay, maybe it was our mistake.'\" The company's owner, Dominick Bova, realized his driver had input the wrong address into her GPS, resulting in the wrongful towing. \"When she put it in her GPS, it took her to 38th Street, but the property we picked up was on 38th Avenue,\" he told the outlet. The driver, he told The U.S. Sun in an exclusive follow-up interview was one of the best he ever had, and was fired to ensure that caliber of mistake never happens again. \"It made me sad because she was one of my better drivers,\" he said. \"But she was driving tired and I would rather someone tell me they weren't able to do a job and needed a break than drive sleepy because that's how mistakes like that are made. So, I let her go.\" He told another driver to use the \"yard truck,\" a truck equipped to tow vehicles that weren't registered with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) to quickly return the vehicles to their owners. He didn't charge them for the towing or storage fees to reconcile. \"I just wanted to get them their cars back as soon as possible,\" he said. \"I didn't want them to wait for another two or three hours for another truck to come by, so I just used the yard truck.\" It seems like a fairly simple and honest way to remedy the mistake. We're just a towing and impound company that abides by all state and city regulations. However, one of the three drivers wasn't satisfied with Bova's fix. Instead, he said they reported his yard truck to the DPS for not being registered with the agency, something that would call his business's legitimacy into question. It was also reported for not donning the proper badges and ID numbers that would tell drivers it was properly registered with the state of Arizona. To add insult to injury, the same driver made serious financial demands for being wrongfully towed. \"[They] demanded $3,000 because I accidentally towed their car,\" he recounted. \"I told them I wasn't going to do that like I didn't charge them to bring their cars back and I thought that was enough, but [they] weren't happy, so they demanded a $500 gift card.\" Wrongfully or not, retrieving a towed vehicle can be a hassle. If your vehicle is towed after parking in a \"No Parking\" zone or other legitimate reason, there are a few steps to take to get it back. Steps to take when your car is towed: If you feel your vehicle was wrongfully towed, contesting the action can be done with the following steps: Source: Oregon Department of Justice , National General , Rak Law Firm Bova said it didn't end there - she made additional demands before Bova's attorneys responded formally after he refused to pay. \"We have lawyers who represent us, and they sent the driver a cease and desist letter, and that's how this story came about,\" he said. \"You can't make everyone happy, I guess.\" Bova was contacted shortly after the story was published regarding the unregistered truck. \"[DPS] called me and told me I had two weeks to register the truck, so I went and registered the truck,\" he said. \"It wasn't that big of a deal.\" Since then, Bova's company has been operating without issue. \"We're just a towing and impound company that abides by all state and city regulations,\" he said.",

        "content": "Financial advisor tells graduating class how they can become self-made millionaires Author and money expert Ramit Sethi revealed the 'simple' trick READ MORE: Expert reveals changes that will help anyone amass $1 million By Emma Saletta For Dailymail.Com Published: 22:16, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Thousands of college graduates are entering adulthood and may need to start thinking more about money management. Author, self-made millionaire, and host of the I Will Teach You to be Rich podcast Ramit Sethi revealed the 'simple' step for college graduates to be financially successful in the future. According to NBC 10 Philadelphia , Sethi's advice for college graduates to achieve financial success is 'invest 10 percent' of their salaries every year. 'At the end of the year, increase that by one percent. Do this for as long as you can and you will be a multimillionaire,' he told CNBC Make It earlier this month. Sethi, who also starred in the 2023 Netflix docuseries How to Get Rich, has years of professional experience and is the founder of IWT. Author and self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi suggests that college students look into investing 10 percent of their salaries every year to be financially successful in the future Sethi, who starred in the 2023 Netflix docuseries How to Get Rich, is the founder and CEO of IWT - a website that hosts over one million readers a month Read More Wife of Big Bang Theory creator flaunts limited edition Hermes bag during discussion on 'guilt-free spending' with Netflix's How To Get Rich star Ramit Sethi According to Sethi's LinkedIn, his parents immigrated to the US in the 1970s from India. 'With four kids and one income, they couldn't afford to send me to college so I built a system to apply 60+ scholarships,' he wrote in his profile description. He went on to receive a full scholarship to Stanford University, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in 2004 and 2005. However, after graduation, he admitted that he took his first scholarship check, invested it in the stock market, and lost around half of it almost immediately. This incident inspired him to learn about money and that what he learned during his schooling was 'irrelevant.' Today, he runs IWT - a website that hosts over one million readers a month that are interested in learning more about business, careers, negotiation, psychology, and money. His 2009 New York Times Best Seller I Will Teach You To Be Rich is a six-week finance program for individuals between the ages of 20 to 35. However, the steps he discussed with NBC 10 Philadelphia on how college graduates will be successful may be simpler for former students to understand. Sethi's 2009 New York Times Best Seller I Will Teach You To Be Rich is a six-week finance program for individuals between the ages of 20 to 35 The first thing a college graduate must do to get started is open their own brokerage account, traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or any other kind of investment account. In order to do so, the college graduate must provide information such as a driver's license and a social security number. Once the account is open, the owner of it can begin depositing money and select what kinds of funds they would like to invest in. NBC 10 Philadelphia also suggests that the account holder look into setting it up so that their investment account will receive automatic deposits. The investment will continue to grow and work well for the college graduate that is looking to be financially successful. Despite Sethi's suggestion in investing 10 percent of a salary every year, college graduates may not have to start doing that right away. It's best for college graduates to begin investing early on so that their money will have longer time to grow through compound interest. According to Fidelity , compound interest is when interest you earn in a savings or investment account earns interest of its own. This means that the investment account holder can earn interest on its initial balance and the interest that is added to the total amount of money over time. An example of this would be if a college graduate was to invest $1,000 and earn an annualized return of 7 percent. This would result in their investment growing to $1,070 by next year and earn 7 percent of their entire balance the year after that. If college graduates were to begin contributing $100 toward an investment account that generates a 7 percent annual return rate when they're 21-years-old, their total could be over $1.4 million by the time they're 65. 'By starting at your college graduation with your first job, you will set yourself up for a lifetime of living a rich life,' said Sethi.

However, except for Apple’s Clock and Calendar apps, the system has no animated or interactive icons – but a researcher has found an exploit that enables just that. iOS apps with animated icons that lets developers create animated app icons. More specifically, the exploit uses the system’s official API to provide alternative app icons, but bypasses the requirement for the action to be performed manually by the user. In a typical scenario, iOS requires the user to choose a custom icon in the app – and then the system displays an alert confirming the change. The action of changing an app’s icon is canceled if the system is unable to verify that it was the user who chose another icon or if the confirmation alert is not shown. As a result, there’s no way for an app to change its icon on its own in the background. But by using a private method to call the API, Bostwick was able to set custom icons without requiring confirmation from the user. The researcher also tricked the system into modifying the app’s status check, so that iOS sees the app as active even when it’s running in the background. This allows the app to change the icon automatically in the background whenever it wants. To demonstrate the possibilities, Bostwick combined multiple frames to make animated icons. Although the idea of having all the icons animated is a bit disturbing, the researcher believes it would be nice to let apps show short animations when they receive a notification, for example. Of course, the App Store Review team would probably reject any apps exploiting such a breach. You can watch the full video demonstrating the exploit in action below: iOS 18 to get revamped Home Screen Although there are no rumors about iOS getting animated icons, recent reports suggest that Apple will give the iPhone Home Screen a major overhaul with iOS 18.

        "description": "Craig Counsell, who is in his first year managing the Cubs after 18 seasons with the Brewers as a player and manager, was booed in his first return to Milwaukee.",
        "content": "MILWAUKEE -- manager Craig Counsell was booed twice Monday afternoon in his return to Milwaukee after managing the for the previous nine seasons. Counsell, 53, was booed during a short video montage, which ended with a picture of him in a Brewers uniform. It happened again after his name was announced during starting lineups. \"Cheer, boo ... whatever, man,\" Counsell said to a large contingent of media before the game. \"Just have a good time at the game. That's what fans get to do.\" Counsell surprised the baseball world -- and shocked Brewers fans -- when the Wisconsin native left the only team he has ever managed for the Cubs this past winter, signing a five-year, $40 million contract. Monday was his first day back at American Family Field since leaving. \"The view from the dugout is certainly different,\" Counsell said. \"This is going to be an interesting day.\" Counsell said he first began to have thoughts about moving on from the Brewers a couple years ago when his boss at the time, president of baseball operations David Stearns, stepped down. Stearns resurfaced with the , where Counsell interviewed during the offseason. \"David Stearns leaving made me think about it a lot,\" Counsell said. \"I don't know how it couldn't. It happened over time.\" There were discussions about Counsell returning, but once his contract with Milwaukee ended last October, the Cubs came calling after David Ross was fired and a deal with Counsell was quickly reached. \"Life takes different turns,\" Counsell said. \"I don't want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. You have to take the ride of life and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you have to jump on the ride and go.\" Counsell spent the final five seasons of his playing career in Milwaukee before eventually joining the front office and then becoming their manager in 2015. In all, he spent 18 years with the Brewers organization, taking Milwaukee to the playoffs five times as manager. He was largely criticized in Wisconsin after accepting the Cubs' offer. Then he was booed again on Monday in his return. \"It bothers you, initially,\" Counsell said of the winter criticism. \"But as it goes on ... you're a fan and you can feel how you want to as a fan. That's part of it. It's what makes sports fun. \"It's not my job to tell people how to feel about something or to even figure it out. Let people feel how they want to feel. I'm good with that. It doesn't have to be all positive. We're in a public job with fans. Fans can feel how they want to feel.\" Right now, his successor and good friend Pat Murphy has the upper hand on Counsell as the Brewers are in first place in the National League Central while the Cubs are in second and have been scuffling of late. \"It's a team that's playing really well,\" Counsell said of the Brewers. \"We are not playing very well right now. We're trying to get things on track.\" Both teams have been hit with injuries, but the Brewers have thrived thanks to a surprisingly resourceful offense which ranks third in runs scored. Meanwhile, the Cubs are led by two top-notch starters -- ERA leader and . Milwaukee began the four-game series with a 31⁄2-game lead on the Cubs in a rivalry which should grow even more now that Counsell has switched sides. And while Monday may not be the last time he's booed at his former place of employment, Counsell won't let it change how he feels about where he grew up and worked most of his adult life. \"I live in Wisconsin,\" he said. \"I enjoy where I live. That's all really good.\"",

        "description": "Mike Tyson was treated by paramedics on a flight to Los Angeles after falling ill, but the boxing legend has since confirmed he will still fight Jake Paul.",
        "content": "boxing Mike Tyson expected to be in fighting shape for his upcoming bout Jake Paul Although the flight arrived two hours later than scheduled, a representative for Tyson clarified that the delay was caused by an air-conditioning fault, not Tyson's health scare. \"Thankfully, Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" read the statement. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that was there to help him. However, it's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay. This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" Misfits boxing star Elle Brooke predicts Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson fight result Mike Tyson health update provided after plane emergency After enduring the incident, the shake-up will not impact Tyson's upcoming fight with Paul on July 20. There have been concerns about Tyson fighting at 58, which he will be when the first bell rings in Texas in July. Nathan Howarth, Development and Operations Director at the Concussion Legacy Foundation UK has warned that Tyson could risk a brain injury. \"Boxing has an inherent risk of concussion and then there’s an increased risk of traumatic brain injury we have seen like bleeds on the brain,\" he told Betway . \"I’m not saying there is any evidence that as an older fighter, Mike would be at risk of that, however, we do know the impacts of subclinical concussions. \"The ones where something has happened to the brain but often turned sub-concussions, those types of blows that are doing damage, but we can’t see are just as important, and it’s particularly important for someone like Mike Tyson who has had a long period of time in the sport anyway. \"We know your exposure to head impacts increases your risk of things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The first reported cases from boxing are from the 1930s and we still see that in terms of boxing’s risk to CTE and it’s no secret that there is an element of neurodegeneration. There’s no definitive of what the risks would be but as someone who is 57, there’s clearly going to be a risk in terms of that age profile of potentially having more of an impact for someone who’s older.\" Tyson vs. Paul's boxing match is scheduled for July 20 at AT&T Stadium and is expected to draw a near-capacity or full-capacity crowd. The venue, which can seat over 80,000 spectators, can be expanded to accommodate up to 100,000 fans, reflecting the high demand and excitement surrounding the event. The head of MVP Promotions has openly admitted that his upcoming fight against Tyson will be the most significant moment of his life. To promote the event, Paul engaged in face-to-face confrontations with Tyson during press conferences held in Texas and New York City. The encounters allowed Paul to fully comprehend the enormity of the occasion as he prepared to step into the ring with the legendary boxer.",

'Free money' from employer contributions mainly benefits highest earners, landmark research reveals Employer contribution match formulas vary depending on the company Research suggests 401(K) matches are mainly benefitting higher earners READ MORE: Americans are retiring earlier - but could they outlive their 401(K)? By Tilly Armstrong Assistant Consumer Editor For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:58 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:27 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 13 shares 13 View comments The 401(K) retirement plan is designed to help workers build a nest egg by putting money aside from their pay check every month. On top of this, they can receive extra money from their employer through a match. But new research suggests that these employer contributions are mainly benefitting the highest earners. Employers contributed $212 billion to retirement plans - roughly 58 cents for every dollar that participants saved - according to latest data from 2021. But some 44 percent of these funds went to the top 20 percent of earners, according to analysis from Vanguard Group. The lowest earners, meanwhile, received just 6 percent of the 'free money' from company matches, it found. Research by Vanguard Group suggests 401(K) employer contributions are mainly benefitting higher earners Read More More Americans than ever plan to retire at 62 - but are they at risk of outliving their 401(K)? It is not surprising that a greater share of employer matching dollars goes to those who are paid more, the study said, given that matching contributions are typically given as a proportion of salary. But it suggests that those earning the most receive a larger share of contributions than their share of income. The match formulas companies use vary. Some firms contribute a set amount each year, for example 3 percent of pay, regardless of whether the worker contributes. A small number of companies contribute up to a dollar cap - for example offering a 10 percent match on 6 percent of pay, subject to a limit of $6,000. But the most common match formula, according to Vanguard, is a percentage match. Typically, this will be half of a worker's contributions up to 6 percent of their pay. When the employer contribution is based on percentage of pay, those with higher incomes typically receive more. But top earners also receive a larger share of 401(K) matching dollars than their share of income, the study showed. On average, those in the top 20 percent income bracket received 39 percent of the income, but 44 percent of their employer's 401(K) contributions. Those in the bottom 20 percent of earners, meanwhile, receive a 29 percent smaller share of matching dollars than income, Vanguard found through analysis of over 1,000 plans between 2013 and 2022. Matching dollars often exacerbates pay inequity, said Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard Group Matching dollars often exacerbates pay inequity, Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard Group, told The Wall Street Journal . One of the reasons higher earners receive a higher amount of employer contributions is because they are more likely to participate in 401(K) plans and earn enough to get a full matching contribution. Of the 10 most popular matching formulas, all but one disproportionately rewarded the top 20 percent of earners with a higher share of matching dollars than income. The study suggests that those earning the most receive a larger share of contributions than their share of income The formula which is the best for more equally distributing employer contributions is when the funds are capped at a dollar amount, Vanguard found. Using a dollar cap formula, the top 20 percent of earners received around 33 percent of the matching contributions, compared to 35 percent of income. Costco, for example, matches 50 percent of workers' annual 401(K) savings up to a $500 cap. The maximum workers can save into a 401(K) for 2024 is $23,000 - according to guidelines set out by the IRS - and $69,000 for combined employee and employer contributions. Those over 50 can also add an additional $7,500 in catch-up contributions. The Vanguard research lays bare the divide at the heart of retirement in the US. Research from Fidelity Investments earlier this month revealed a strong stock market means there are now more 401(K) millionaires than ever before . The number of seven-figure 401(K) accounts rose to 485,000 in the first quarter of this year - up 15 percent from the previous quarter. A year ago, there were 340,000, according to the investment firm. Meanwhile, separate research earlier this year found a record number of Americans took money out of their 401(K) plan in 2023 for a financial emergency - as high inflation continues to wear away savings for many.

        "content": "Susannah Scaroni’s schedule hasn’t allowed her to compete very often at the Bolder Boulder. When she does, however, she leaves as a champion. At the 44th Bolder Boulder on Monday, Scaroni won the women’s push rim race by shattering the course record with a time of 23 minutes, 31 seconds. The previous women’s record was 25:43, set by Candace Cable in 1996. Scaroni also won the push rim race in 2013, the only other year she’s competed. “Honestly, I love this race and I love the race coordinator, Jacob Heilveil,” Scaroni said. “He was my kid role model when I was starting wheelchair racing, and almost every other year since 2013, I’ve been in another competition. That competition got pushed back this year, so I finally can come back.” The 2020 Paralympic Games champion in the women’s 5,000-meter push rim race, Scaroni has her sights set on another gold medal this year in Paris. The Champaign, Ill., native used the Bolder Boulder as a test. “This is also a Paralympic year and a lot of people going other places, so it was kind of a smaller field,” she said. “I just wanted to see how hard I could go today. Very happy, yes. “All I remember from this course (in 2013) is my lungs hurt at the end, and that’s how I feel today.” Kendall Gretsch, who won the previous two years, finished as runner-up in 27:08. Gretsch, from Colorado Springs, beat her times from the past two years. Repeating as men’s champion was Howie Sanborn of Denver. He finished third overall, with a time of 27:24. “This race is always fun, and we got caught another beautiful day,” said Sanborn, who turned 42 on Monday. “This time of year the weather can be hit or miss, especially on the winds, and today was perfect. So it was a fun day to race, plus it’s my birthday. So yeah, it’s nice to come out here and catch a win on your birthday.” Proud to be the men’s champion, Sanborn was impressed with both Scaroni and Gretsch. “Susannah is like the best in the world when it comes to racing chair and last year was the only time I’ve ever beaten Kendall in the racing chair,” Sanborn said. “So, I know she’s just gonna go so hard. I just did my best to keep up. I had her for a little bit on the downhill part, but she caught me on the final (stretch).” Gretsch and Sanborn will both compete in Paris at the Paralympics in the para triathlon later this summer. Prior to Memorial Day weekend, race director Cliff Bosley was projecting participation numbers to be around 45,000. He was pleasantly surprised to see that number get blown away. In all, there were 48,169 entrees – a more than 8,000 ahead of 2023 (40,044) and the most since 2018 (50,914). “The enthusiasm of our participants to want to be a part of it in a bigger way than we thought (was great),” Bosley said. “I didn’t judge that one right. I didn’t see it, but it’s great. This is just the last couple of weeks that there was that heightened interest.” In fact, on Sunday night, race organizers considered closing off entries because there was concern about whether they had enough T-shirts and snack bags for entrants. Ultimately, however, registration remained open and about 550 registered Monday morning. “If we don’t have to be, we don’t want to be in a position to turn people away,” Bosley said. Between the men’s pro race, women’s pro race and push rim competition, $101,800 was awarded in prize money on Monday. ... From the high number of entries to the perfect weather and thrilling finishes, Bosley said the day could not have been much better. “It all came together,” he said. “We talk in our office about we work 364 days for one, so it’s kind of cool when the one day is the day that works.” ... Bosley said roughly 43,400 of the entrants finished the race. That’s about 90%, which is the same as 2023 but better than the previous four events from 2017-2022. ... Bosley said there were some incidents of dehydration, but no abnormal medical incidents during the race.",

You’re the one to beat.” added: “What’s amazing is how slight you are and I never see you take a breath then you do those notes that last forever. I think Alesha’s right, you’re the one to beat tonight.” Simon said: “We felt how much this means to you”, and he went on to say: “You deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented.” Viewers were equally impressed by Innocent and took to social media to express how they felt. One wrote: “He is amazing!” Another added: “This opera singer WOW #BritainsGotTalent.\" But the biggest news came from Innocent later on when Dec said: \"Since we saw you last, you’re married now.\" Innocent replied \"yes I am\" as the camera panned to his new wife who jumped up and down, thrilled to have been watching him from the audience. Innocent was put straight through first on Monday night after receiving the most public votes. The judges were then forced to choose between Ssaulabi Performance Troupe and The Trickstars. straight away picked Ssaulabi whilst Alesha had to take more time to make her decision but also came to the same decision, as did Amanda. Simon said he would have also picked Ssaulabi. The group said about getting through to the final show on Sunday 2 June: “We represent Taekwondo in Korea, we will show everything we have. Dec said to Innocent: “What a year you’re having, the audition we saw you back in January, your wedding and now here you are, the winner of tonight’s semi-final. What a special time.” Innocent replied: “This is my year, I’m so happy and I’m ready. I am ready for Sunday. I hope you are ready as well.” The first who had to drag him up on stage to participate. Bruno was spun around in mid-air by the couple, but when asked if he enjoyed the act, he said: “It worked for me! It’s a bit scary - and I thought that anyway. Every time you were spinning around, I thought she was going to crash. I found it very scary and very dramatic.”",

        "description": "A 2022 Government Accountability Office Report revealed 91% of colleges understate the price students will actually pay to attend.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — As students applied for college this year, many were hit with an unexpected setback. The FAFSA — the tool that allows students to apply for federal financial aid — didn’t become fully available online until almost four months later than usual. Like cascading dominos, that delay has led to a slew of problems in the college admissions process. Students are visiting colleges, meeting with potential professors and charting their next steps before even receiving an aid offer. Many students will have to decide on a college, or whether to go to college at all, without even knowing how much they will pay to attend. But it’s not the first time students have faced this decision without a clear understanding of the dollars and cents. At most universities, that’s the norm. A 2022 Government Accountability Office Report revealed 91% of colleges understate the price students will actually pay to attend. Not a single school followed all the best practices identified in the GAO’s report, and two-thirds failed to mention important financial details in their communications with students. This prevents students from planning ahead or considering their borrowing costs. Even worse, a third of colleges listed loans as grants. One study found various colleges were referring to just one type of federal loan by 136 different names, some of which didn’t even include the word “loan!” Institutions often used this tactic to zero out the total, making it look like students would pay $0 to attend. Only when students read the fine print would they see much of that “aid” was actually a loan to be paid back with interest. ADVERTISEMENT This tactic is a key piece of the puzzle as to why the cost of college keeps going up. And while it’s not the only factor, when colleges and universities hide the ball, students can’t shop around for their best option. This doesn’t fly in any other financial arena. A new home or car owner has information down to the finest detail, but students borrowing similar amounts too often do not have access to an accurate bottom-line. Students fresh out of high school are taking their first steps into adulthood while making one of the biggest financial decisions in their lives. Yet, they often sign the dotted line without knowing exactly how much they’re expected to pay. That’s why we introduced a bipartisan bill, the Understanding the True Cost of College Act. When colleges offer students financial aid packages, we want to ensure they are comparable among colleges. The information students receive should use the same terms, clearly show the amount the student would borrow and allow students to compare their options apples-to-apples, not apples-to-oranges. Bipartisan, bicameral solutions like this empower students, and greater cost transparency can help lower the cost of a college education. Under our proposal, aspiring scholars would know the cost of each option from the jump. The same GAO report that found 91% of colleges understate their attendance costs also noted our bill would help fix many of the issues students are currently up against. This year’s FAFSA delays emphasize exactly why students need timely, accurate financial breakdowns. Students naturally struggle to make the right choice when they’re rushed or uninformed. Before students take the leap — and tens of thousands of dollars in loans — Congress and colleges should help make sure they have the full picture.",

A spokesperson said the team is looking into the matter and has spoken with McManus’ agent and the NFL office. ESPN reported two women are suing McManus for sexually assaulting them during a charter flight to London last year when he was playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars. “We take allegations of this nature very seriously,” the spokesperson said in a message sent to The Associated Press. Citing court documents that have not yet been posted on Duval County’s public records database, ESPN reports the women, identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, are accusing McManus of rubbing and grinding against them during the flight and the Jaguars of failing to supervise him and create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking more than $1 million and asking for a jury trial, according to ESPN. A message sent to agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents McManus, was not immediately returned. The Jaguars had no comment. McManus, who turns 33 in July, signed with Washington in March.

        "content": "Prince William had just four words to say when Prince Harry told him Meghan Markle was pregnant with their first child. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were delighted when they found out they were going to become parents back in 2018. The pair decided to announce the happy news to the Royal Family in October that year at Princess Eugenie's wedding with Jack Brooksbank. Harry wrote about the moment in his memoir, Spare, and revealed he told his brother while they were are at the reception in St George's Hall in Windsor. He wrote: \"We were in a big room, suits of armour on the walls. Strange room, strange moment\", reports The Mirror .

He said: \"She also gave a big smile and hearty congratulations. They both reacted exactly as I hoped - as I'd wished.\" Meghan and Harry also told King Charles about their pregnancy at the wedding. The Duke of Sussex said the monarch was \"delighted\" when he found out. Harry wrote: \"Just before a drink reception for the bride and groom, we cornered Pa in his study. He was delighted to learn that he was going to be a grandfather for a fourth time; his wide smile warmed me.\" Meghan gave birth to Prince Archie on May 6, 2019 at the Portland Hospital, London . The Sussexes have since gone on to welcome a second child, Princess Lilibet, who was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, on June 4, 2021. Harry also wrote about the birth of his first child in his memoir and admitted he was very nervous ahead of the birth. To calm himself down, Harry decided to try out the laughing gas that was meant for his wife. When Meghan's labour began, however, Harry was forced to apologise for accidentally using the entire canister of laughing gas. He wrote: \"When her contractions began to quicken, and deepen, a nurse came and tried to give some laughing gas to Meg.",

The remains of only five people had been recovered by Monday, local authorities reported. It was not immediately clear why the tally of six reported on Sunday had been revised down. In a letter to the UN resident coordinator dated Sunday and seen by The Associated Press, the acting director of the country's National Disaster Center, Luseta Laso Mana, said the landslide \"buried more than 2000 people alive\" and caused \"major destruction\" in Yambali village in Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived at the number of people affected. The International Organisation for Migration, which is working closely with the government and taking a leading role in the international response, has not changed its estimated death toll of 670 released on Sunday, pending new evidence. \"We are not able to dispute what the government suggests but we are not able to comment on it,\" said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the UN migrant agency's mission in Papua New Guinea. \"As time goes in such a massive undertaking, the number will remain fluid,\" Aktoprak said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent \"heartfelt condolences\" to the families of the victims and the people and government of PNG and said the UN and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts, and \"the United Nations stands ready to offer additional assistance at this challenging time,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. The death toll of 670 was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by the landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. The office of PNG Prime Minister James Marape did not respond on Monday to a request for an explanation of what the government estimate of 2000 was based on. Marape has promised to release information about the scale of the destruction and loss of life when it becomes available. Determining the scale of the disaster is difficult because of challenging conditions on the ground, including the village's remote location, a lack of telecommunications and tribal warfare throughout the province which means international relief workers and aid convoys require military escorts. At least 26 tribal warriors and mercenaries were killed in a battle between two warring tribes in Enga in February, as well as an unconfirmed number of bystanders. The national government's lack of reliable census data also adds to the challenges of determining how many are potentially dead. Earth-moving equipment used by PNG's military was being transported to the disaster scene, 400km from the east coast city of Lae. Traumatised villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives, officials said.

        "content": "The Washington Commanders said Monday they were made aware of a lawsuit filed in civil court last week against kicker Brandon McManus. A spokesperson said the team is looking into the matter and has spoken with McManus’ agent and the NFL office. ESPN reported two women are suing McManus for sexually assaulting them during a charter flight to London last year when he was playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars. “We take allegations of this nature very seriously,\" the spokesperson said in a message sent to The Associated Press. Citing court documents that have not yet been posted on Duval County’s public records database, ESPN reports the women, identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, are accusing McManus of rubbing and grinding against them during the flight and the Jaguars of failing to supervise him and create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking more than $1 million and asking for a jury trial, according to ESPN. A message sent to agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents McManus, was not immediately returned. The Jaguars had no comment. McManus, who turns 33 in July, signed with Washington in March. The Philadelphia native has been in the league for a decade, the first nine seasons with the Denver Broncos, after playing at Temple. AP Sports Writer Mark Long in Jacksonville, Florida, contributed.

        "description": "Justine and her partner cut their losses and sold their home cheap in the inner suburb of Darwin after months of no takers.",
        "content": "Justine Searle never imagined selling her home in Darwin would prove to be a challenge that lost her $100,000. \"We had purchased it back in 2010 off the plan for $465,000, and when we did sell, we sold for $362,000,\" she said. Ms Searle had bought the apartment in the inner-city suburb of Woolner, just before the construction , and rented it out. But she and her partner felt they were \"throwing good money after bad\" trying to pay off the mortgage, despite it nearly always having tenants. Late last year, Ms Searle and her partner put it on the market for just under $400,000. \"There were no takers at all, the agent didn't even get a phone call,\" she said. After months of no traction, increasing interest rates, and chipping in almost $1,000 a month for associated costs, Ms Searle and her partner decided to cut their losses. The property sold within days after dropping the price. NT property market 'in peril' Darwin remains the cheapest capital city to buy in the country, with median home prices at just over $490,000, PropTrack senior economist Eleanor Creagh said. And though prices rose marginally — to 0.16 per cent above April 2023 levels — last month, returning to positive growth for the first time in more than a year, Darwin's market is growing at one of the slowest rates in the country. Rental prices continue to increase at a fast pace in Darwin, sitting at an average of $600 a week, compared to $560 in Melbourne and $600 in Brisbane. Derek Hart has been a real estate agent in Darwin for 16 years, and is seeing scores of young people taking advantage of low sales prices, and many others fed up with high rents, buying homes instead. \"We've got a lot of first time buyers coming into the market. So people are realising that the interest rates at the end of the year are going to be dropping,\" he said. \"And with rents going up ... in the long run with capital growth, it's better for the buyer to purchase a home instead of renting.\" However, Aswin De Silva, chief executive of REINT, the NT's peak real estate body, says the \"property market is currently facing major issues\". \"I don't mind calling it, we are in peril,\" he said. He said house prices have remained stagnant since 2022, and in regional centres like Katherine and Alice Springs prices \"have taken a beating\". Mr De Silva said rental yields — the amount of money an owner is making on an investment property — were currently about 7 per cent. \"This is unhealthy and not sustainable as family income available to pay rents are going down, largely due to cost of living pressures,\" he said. \"Vacancy rates are stable at slightly under 5 per cent but could increase if we see an escalation of crime and anti-social issues particularly in Alice Springs.\" 'Nobody's going to stay here if rent rates are high' In the wake of crime waves that have been covered extensively in the media, interest rate hikes and financial stress, Mr De Silva said the NT's market challenges are not going anywhere anytime soon. And to make matters worse, he said a scarcity in affordable homes meant people aren't coming to the territory to invest. \"Nobody's going to stay here if rent rates are high, and there is no affordable housing,\" he said. \"It is very difficult to get private investments and developer inducement with exorbitant building costs, supply-chain issues and complex approval processes.\" While some parts of Australia are seeing , the NT's has remained almost stationary. The Northern Territory is losing thousands more residents interstate than it's gaining, meaning the jurisdiction is set to miss its 2030 population target of 300,000 people. Mr De Silva said that's because people don't see opportunities or a future in the NT and aren't willing to pay the high housing costs, driving down demand. \"It's why migrants come, they get their permanent residency or they finish their education and they move elsewhere,\" he said. \"Most mums and dads who have young children want to educate their children elsewhere. \"They don't see a pathway for them to grow. \"All these things need to be addressed for us to be also running the race with other capital cities, to ensure investors and landlords see a capital benefit.\" 'Bold plans' and building boosts This month the Country Liberal Party announced it would provide first home buyers up to $50,000 to help build a new home, and $30,000 to new Territorians to build a home to live in, if elected into power at the August election. \"This is a bold plan that will help boost our population, retain skilled workers and stimulate construction,\" CLP leader Lia Finocchiaro said. NT Chief Minister Eva Lawler said first home buyers in the territory have access to $10,000 stamp duty relief, and that up to 100 new homes would be built over the next five years under her government, with $50 million invested in building more affordable homes.",

        "content": "STEPHEN A. Smith had a response for Shannon Sharpe after the latter's comments about Kyrie Irving during First Take. The ESPN stars gave their approval of the Dallas Mavericks star Irving's recent play on Monday's edition of First Take . The Mavs hold a 3-0 series lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. And Irving has been a tremendous superstar sidekick alongside superstar Luka Doncic in the series, averaging 27.6 points per contest. Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe were at ESPN's Los Angeles studios as they spoke about Irving. Sharpe shared what Irving has impressed him the most. \"What I love most about Kyrie is the maturity and the growth which he's shown,\" the NFL icon said. The 55-year-old Sharpe was seemingly referencing Irving and his past numerous public and private outbursts with his past teams which include feuding with Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai. Smith agreed with Sharpe, saying, \"This is what we've been asking for\" from Irving. Sharpe continued, revealing his belief that Irving has been a mentor for Luka like LeBron attempted to do for the point guard when both were with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Stephen A. then gave a take of his own. \"I'll take it one step further,\" he said. \"What he was expected to do in Boston ... in Brooklyn ... he is now doing in Dallas.\" Smith referenced Irving's tenures with the Nets as well as the Boston Celtics . Despite making the All-Star team four times in the six years combined with the Nets and Celtics, Irving didn't go far in the playoffs with either team. Irving also shot just 38 percent from the field in his lone postseason appearance with Boston. Fast forward to 2024 and Irving has a chance to reach the NBA Finals for the first time since his days with the Cavaliers. He won a title alongside LeBron with the Cavaliers in the 2015-16 season. The guard duo of Irving and Doncic have been a match made in heaven as both combined for 66 points in Game 3 of the Mavericks' win over the Timberwolves. Dallas needs just one more win to reach the NBA Finals which begin on June 6. Irving has the chance to play his former team, the Celtics, in the championship . Boston has a 3-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.",

        "description": "Arkansas will faece SEMO Friday at 2 p.m.",
        "content": "BY DUDLEY E. DAWSON FAYETTEVILLE – For the sixth time in seven years, Arkansas will be hosting a NCAA Baseball Tournament Regional, but it is not something that Razorback head coach Dave Van Horn is taking for granted. “Yeah, super excited to be hosting another regional,” Van Horn said. “It’s not easy. It’s like I told the team, there’s 250-260 teams that aren’t playing anymore. And it’s hard to get in. “There were a lot of really good teams that were on the bubble this year. It’s a long grind, the whole season. And for the most part we’ve maneuvered it pretty well. “But we’re really excited for the postseason and we’re even more happy that we get to stay here and play it in front of our fans who have been incredible for us this year.” Fayetteville Regional top seed and No. 5 national seed Arkansas (43-14) will play regional fourth seed and Ohio Valley Conference champion Southeastern Missouri State (34-25) Friday at 2 p.m. The other Friday match up will have second-seed Louisiana Tech (45-17) and third-seeded Kansas State (32-24) facing off at 7 p.m. The two winners will play Saturday at 8 p.m after the two losers play at 2 p.m. The Fayetteville Regional is paired up with the Charlottesville one hosted by No. 12 overall seed and regional top seed Virginia and also includes SEC power Mississippi State, St. John’s and Pennsylvania. Van Horn was obviously happy to be a top eight national seed, which allows you to also host a best two-of-three Super Regional if you advance out of the regional. That would also mean playing at home until the College World Series if you can continue to win. “Just it’s great being a top 8,” Van Horn said. “It doesn’t matter 1 or 8 to me, or anywhere in between. So, excited about that. “Our regional is a true regional with Louisiana Tech about four or five hours away. SEMO probably five hours away, something like that. I just feel like ... And K-State, same thing. Probably 5 and a half maybe. “Should be really good crowds. I would think the other teams would be able to bring a lot of fans. You just think that anyway. But I don’t know, you never know what’s going to happen this time of the year, who’s hot or who’s not. Who’s hurt, who’s not? Who’s sick, who’s not? Been on both sides of it. So just excited to be back playing here.” Arkansas was one of a record-setting 11 SEC teams to make the 64-team NCAA Tournament, which was announced Monday morning on ESPN2. The top three national seeds, four of the top five and five of the top seven were all from the SEC – No. 1 Tennessee, No. 2 Kentucky and No. 3 Texas A&M – while ACC power North Carolina was No. 4 and Arkansas No. 5, Clemson No. 6, Georgia No. 7 and Florida State No. 8. “So if you get through this league, you’re definitely battle-tested,” Van Horn said. “You go out and you play in a regional, you’ve got a really good shot to get to the final day, so-to-speak, the championship game, whether you’ve got to win a couple or one. “Just because you’ve played such good competition, you’re not going to be shocked or anything by how good somebody is, I don’t feel like, because you’ve probably already seen it. That’s just the way the SEC is now. We kind of kid around, big-boy baseball.” Arkansas has lost its last three games, four of five and 7 of 10, with 8 of its 11 game being on the road. Van Horn knows his team is ready to play at home, where it is 33-3 this season, including a school-record tying 27 victories in a row. “We didn’t play terrible, didn’t play great,” Van. Born said. “Just played good teams. It was a neutral site. It was frustrating losing because we lost four of five games on the road trip and we’re not used to losing, doesn’t sit well with us obviously but the players don’t like losing either. “It’s not like, ‘Oh well, we lost, whatever.’ They’re like the coaches, they take it personal and we’re looking forward to getting back. I don’t think the way we played in the tournament will make us play worse in the regional, if anything we should play a little better. “Little more motivated, better rested going into this thing. If we play good, great. Hopefully we win. If we don’t, it’s probably because the other teams are really good.” As the host, Arkansas had the chance to play either a day game or night game on Friday, but Van Horn thinks playing the afternoon one is the right move for the team, alebit maybe not as much for the fans. “Really experienced with both,” Van Horn said. “Having to deal with the weather if you’re the second game and the first game gets played, and the second game gets delayed or rained out, then having to play super early in the morning and for sure going to play two the next day somehow, some way if possible. “You know, just talking to other coaches in the past about the way they do it, it used to be they’d tell me, ‘Yeah, they made us play at night.’ Until there was an issue with the weather and then they figured out it might be better to play early. “It cuts into our crowd, or it makes it harder for the fans to get here for a 1 o’clock game or 2, whatever your scheduled that day, because that’s usually what they are. We understand that, but as far as for the team, just getting up, going through routine and playing and if there is weather, you have more time to fight it throughout the day.” Arkansas has one of the best – if not the best – college pitchers in ace Hagen Smith (9-1, 1.48), who is 24-5 in his Razorback career with a school-record 353 strikeouts with 154 this season. Smith’s only loss was in the SEC Tournament after giving up two runs while the TV broadcasters were talking about his velocity being down. Van Horn said that was simply not the case. “They’re wrong,” Van Horn said. “They were watching the scoreboard, which was at least four miles an hour slow and some times five. “So we’re seeing it on TV, if you watching a game like recently, and you seeing 93, 94, they are seeing 89, 90. So they are sitting there in that booth and seeing the scoreboard and they were wrong. Hagen’s velocity was still way up there as was what you were watching on TV. “You weren’t watching that goofy scoreboard and it was really messed up – easily four miles an hour slow. Because I had said something about it in game one to one of the coaches and (pitching) Coach (Matt) Hobbs said ‘yeah, that thing is four to five miles an hour slow, all the scouts are getting a correct time on their radar guns. “That is kind of disappointing that these guys would say that to a national TV audience with not having the facts. He’s fine.” Van Horn was not ready to at least publicly state who he will start in opening game. “See who’s feeling really good, actually,” Van Horn said. “And obviously look at the team we play and their lineup and how they do against rights or lefts, if you have that option. “If we had a set rotation — because it’s been a little bit jumbled the last few weeks — it might make it a little easier. We’ll just look at all those things. Right now we’re just kind of diving into scouting reports and trying to watch some video and just make a good decision. Our goal is ... We’ve got to win at least three in this thing.” Photo by John D. James",

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases . Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors.

        "content": "Winnipeggers are about to start seeing a lot more orange vests and big rigs out on the road. The City of Winnipeg has officially announced the beginning of its annual road construction season. It said there is $138.3 million in the budget for repairing 150 lane kilometres of local and regional streets, and active transportation infrastructure like new bike lanes. It said another $7.2 million will be used solely for new active transportation infrastructure. All projects have been tendered and will start very soon if they haven’t already, the city said. “I thank residents for their patience and cooperation during construction season,” Winnipeg Mayor Scott Gillingham said. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “Some of the key projects included this year will be work on the St. Vital bridge — that work continues with $13 million this year — rehabilitation of the Pembina Highway bridges over the La Salle River, and the construction of a new bridge on Creek Bend Road over the Seine River.” Story continues below advertisement Several major routes, including Inkster Boulevard, Abinojii Mikanah, Grant Avenue, McGregor Street and Dugald Road, will also be under construction. “As construction picks up, we encourage drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike to check our lane closures app and plan ahead for any required detours. Residents can also download and use Waze to find the fastest route,” the city said.

        "description": "The tennis legend had a lump in his throat and found it ‘difficult’ to say what had to be said.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis , despite a first-round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Rafael Nadal makes sad exit from the French Open. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday — but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. It was the Spaniard’s fourth defeat in 116 matches at the French Open. In a sign of just how beloved he is, the occasion drew other players — world No.1 stars Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek as well as his Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz among them — to watch the match in person. Nadal’s family, including his wife Xisca and their young son, were also on hand. “The feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. It is difficult for me to talk. Honestly I don’t know if it will be the last time before you all,” the 14-time champion said. “It is a big percentage I will not be back, but the body is feeling a bit better and I having fun. Maybe in two months I will say enough (and retire), but I hope to be back on this court in two months for the Olympics. That motivates me.” Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going — and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year’s tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years — in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. “It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” said Nadal. “I’m booked in Wimbledon because I had to, (but) I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now. “I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.” Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year’s comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” Nadal added. “I’ve been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I’ll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. “Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what’s the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.” Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. “If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself,” Nadal said.",

        "content": "JEOPARDY! fans have been driven crazy by Grant DeYoung's way of answering questions. Jeopardy! viewers claimed that fan-favorite contestant Matt Amodio is guilty of responding to clues the same way. On Saturday, the Jeopardy! Instagram page posted a montage of clips showcasing Grant competing on the game show , captioned, \"And just like that, he’s a 4-day #Jeopardy ! champion.\" The grocery clerk from Prescott, Arizona was shown prefacing his responses to clues by saying \"What's\" instead of the standard \"What is.\" In the comment section, one person wrote, \"The 'what’s X' for answers about people drove me nuts!! why can’t you say 'who is X' aaaahhhh. The fan gave Grant some credit as they added, \"He has an excellent vibe tho.\" A second commenter replied, \"Another player did that and I believe he said it made it easier for him not having to think of who/what, etc.\" \"I think it was Matt Amodio,\" offered a third. \"Oh I forgot he did that! But Grant always answers with « what’s X? » too!\" replied a fourth fan while a fifth stated, \"I totally understand the strategy behind it!!\" Elsewhere in the comment thread, fans showered Grant with compliments, with one person writing, \"He was so much fun. Wish he would have made it to 5days.\" \"Really enjoyed watching this young man!!!\" added another. During his 4-day streak, Grant used a chair while competing causing viewers to stand up and notice. However, the request to sit while competing has been granted before, and Jeopardy! producers stressed there is nothing against asking for a seat. Grant won four contests and took home $81,203. He also had fans clamoring about how he competed sitting in a chair instead of standing. Grant sat in a black swivel chair with silver armrests and full back support, adjusted to the same height as his standing opponents. After noticing questions from curious fans, Grant took it upon himself to share why he was sitting on Reddit. He explained that he suffers from arthritis and producers gave him a chair so he could play at his best . \"They give it if you ask,\" he wrote. \"I have some back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult.\" And he's not the first one to request an accommodation due to injury or disability. \"I wouldn't expect everyone who sits for Jeopardy! to disclose their reason for needing one, but I don't mind saying mine,\" Grant added. While contestants typically stand throughout the game show, fans might recall 2024 Tournament of Champions finalist Troy Meyer sitting for his games. It's a rarely-used accommodation, but Jeopardy! bosses have previously explained that the choice is given to everyone . \"We would never make people stand, and you'll see in the coming weeks that we had a contestant who did choose to sit,\" the higher-ups explained. Referring to Troy, they said, \"After their performance, they felt like that may be a better opportunity for them. \"We are not saying no you have to stand and play, we want you to play at your very best. \"Sitting down is absolutely an option.\" Producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss reiterated that philosophy when she addressed the situation on the Inside Jeopardy! podcast. \"This is something that we always offer to contestants,\" Sarah shared. \"Please know that any contestant is given the opportunity to have a chair at any point.\" \"We don’t ask why; it’s not our business,\" she added. \"If you want a chair, we’ll give it to you.\" One of the show's all-time champs, Amy Schneider , recently took advantage of the chair offer during the Jeopardy! Masters tournament. The 44-year-old revealed she wasn’t feeling well during the semifinals, so the producer brought out a chair. Jeopardy! first aired in 1964 until 1975. Then the nighttime version began in 1974. Since then, spinoffs of the game show have emerged. Here they all are: Jeopardy! - (primetime) 1974 to present, weekdays on ABC at 7pm. Tournament of Champions - 1984 to present, features the top champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. Celebrity Jeopardy! - 1992 to present, has celebrities compete against each other to raise money for charity. Jeopardy! Masters - 2023 to present, features six notable recent Jeopardy! champions competing against each other. Jeopardy! National College Championship - 2022 to present, undergraduates from 36 colleges and universities across America compete to win $100,000. Other versions of Jeopardy! have fizzled out throughout the years. \"It's a fact that I wasn't feeling well on the day we taped the semifinals,\" she said on X, before explaining that, \"they had a chair out for me because I was experiencing some dizziness and wasn't sure I could stand for a whole episode.\" \"But I want to be crystal clear that that's *not* why I lost,\" she made sure to clarify. Amy was eliminated in the semi-finals of the recently completed prime-time event. She said that while she thinks her health issues affected her performance on the game show, she said she didn’t think the other players needed to be at their peak to beat her, and that was the difference between them. Amy added that it was highly possible the other contestants also had outside circumstances affecting their play yet still played better than her. \"Whether or not my outside circumstance was the 'most' damaging is both unknowable, and irrelevant,\" she tweeted. \"I just lost, and that's ok.\" This year's Masters title went to Victoria Groce.",

        "content": "THE NHS has been slammed for saying fat people are “living with overweight” to avoid insulting them. The nonsense phrase is used online after soft-touch researchers said calling someone large is offensive. 1 The NHS has been slammed for saying fat people are 'living with overweight' Credit: Getty NHS weight advice says: “Living with overweight and obesity can affect your quality of life.” And a report on their slimming programme adds: “The adult population living with overweight in England is 25.6 million, of which 11.4 million adults are living with obesity. ” Experts call it “person-first language” and claim it reduces discrimination. But Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: “The NHS use the phrase ‘living with overweight’ as a politically correct way of appeasing patients. “It is a mistaken attempt to ease their fear of being labelled fat. The expression completely fudges the difference between BMI 26 and any size above. “Obesity is a medical term that pinpoints BMI 30 as being potentially life-threatening.” Doctors recognise obesity as a disease as it is linked to genetics and raises the risk of cancer, stroke and dementia. But being overweight is generally carrying a few extra pounds.

It is not helpful.” BMI threshold for obesity should LOWERED to 27 - as experts warn millions at risk of silent killers are 'missed' An NHS spokesman said: “This term is widely used nationally and internationally.”",

        "description": "It's been a tough few months for Cait Fitton's Coronation Street character Lauren Bolton, who has been at the centre of a harrowing storyline that saw her vanish without a trace",
        "content": "fans are all set to finally unravel the mystery surrounding . Actress Cait Fitton, who portrays the character of Lauren in the show, became a part of the Corrie team in 2022 and has since been a key player in some thrilling plotlines. Earlier this year, in her case - and viewers will soon discover the truth. Off-camera, Cait doesn't mirror her problematic character on screen and is known to love dressing up glamorous. Let's take a sneak peek into her professional journey, friendly ties on set, and hidden talents.... Cait made a name for herself with her acting skills, bagging the role in Corrie after appearances in Doctors and the children's programme Gigglebiz but she's also an accomplished vocalist. The 22 year old once treated her Instagram followers with a flawless rendition of Ben E. King's Stand By Me, reports . The talented actress who hails from Middleton, Greater Manchester, captioned her Instagram post: \"I feel beyond privileged to say my professional showreel has been filmed by @olibogroup and I am mega excited to share it with you guys!\" Music may be her passion, but it seems that a spot on the cobbles of was always Cait's ultimate ambition. She reminisced with about a childhood memory: \"The teacher asked us, 'What do you want to be when you're older?' Children were saying 'a fireman' or 'a nurse', and I said, 'I want to be in Coronation Street'. I remember all the teachers were amused, they couldn't believe it. I watched it religiously.\" She continued, sharing her adoration for the show's characters: \"I loved Gail and Becky and Kylie and I'd think, 'This is my dream'. I spent so long dreaming about it and wanted it so badly. Sometimes I'd despair and think it was never going to happen, but it just shows that if you fight and you work hard for your dreams, you can achieve.\" Cait's Instagram is a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes glimpses from the set, where she's formed close bonds with co-stars like Paddy Bever, who plays Max, and Julia Goulding, who has been a mentor figure to her. \"Everyone's just been so nice. It's been amazing. Everyone's been so kind,\" she gushed about her Corrie colleagues. Landing the role of Lauren was nothing short of a dream come true for Cait, a sentiment she expressed in an emotional Instagram post celebrating the milestone and thanking her supporters. Cait expressed her excitement by writing: \"My younger self is screaming right now! ! ! I want to say a big thank you to all the cast and crew at @coronationstreet for inviting me in with open arms and making me feel so welcome! Thank you to my amazing agent Brooke Kinsella at @intertalentactors for constantly supporting me and always pushing me to achieve.\" In an emotional tribute to her family members, she added: \"Also a massive thank you to my family and friends who have supported me throughout this process and been with me along the journey so far! I dedicate this role of achievement to my family who were huge fans of the show but unfortunately are no longer with me, but I know if they were, they'd be bursting at the seams!\"",

Simon Cowell The successful music executive originally started as a judge in the British singing competition show Pop Idol, which inspired the hit spin-off American Idol, where Cowell judged from 2002-2010. Cowell also created both the British and American versions of The X Factor, where he is credited for helping launch the careers of One Direction and Fifth Harmony. Cowell has been judging on AGT since 2016, and also serves as an executive producer. That year, he spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about what inspired the show. ‘I came up with the idea of the show 12 years ago. One day in my kitchen watching another talent show, some girl was singing so badly, I actually thought to myself, 'I'd rather watch dogs dancing!'” he said. “Looking back all those years ago, it was just a fun idea. It was very difficult to sell. But we were fortunate someone at NBC bought into it. America was the first country to go for it. Now it's all over the world,’ he added. Sofia Vergara Originally from Columbia, Vergara got her big break playing Gloria on ABC’s Modern Family. She has been judging on AGT since 2020, \"It was, kind of, strange for me to start a new job. Because, it was something I was not used to at all,\" Vergara told E! News about her first season. \"But, the moment I got there everybody was so nice to me. Everybody, you know, I loved being there. I enjoyed being there. So, it was easy.\" Heidi Klum The German model has been an AGT judge since 2013, where she stayed until 2018. After a brief hiatus, she re-joined the show in 2020 for season 15. “I love being back. It’s a family affair and I am very honored to be back on AGT,” Klum told Hollywoodlife of her return. Howie Mandel The Canadian comedian joined AGT as a judge all the way back in 2009. He also famously hosted NBC’s Deal or No Deal from 2005-2019. “I don’t feel like I show up at work; I feel like I’m sitting on the couch with a bunch of my friends, just saying what I think,” Mandel told NBC Insider of his experience as a judge. “And that comfort allows me just to be honest and real.” Terry Crews (Host) Crews joined AGT as host in 2019, replacing Tyra Banks. Starting his career in the NFL, he transferred to the acting universe. His most famous roles include White Chicks, Everybody Hates Chris, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. “I hope to see you again, but I don't know,” Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. “There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.” It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no-one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. “Rafa! Rafa!” went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semifinal match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris after her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "description": "A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported.",
        "content": "A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un's hopes to field satellites to monitor the U.S. and South Korea. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. KCNA cited the unidentified vice director of the National Aerospace Technology Administration as saying that a preliminary examination showed that the explosion was related to the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen-petroleum engine. He said other possible causes will be investigated, according to KCNA. Japan's government briefly issued a missile warning for the southern prefecture of Okinawa, urging residents to take shelter inside buildings and other safer places. The warning was lifted later because the region was no longer in danger, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Asia North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara called the North’s launch “a serious challenge to the entire world.” South Korea’s Unification Ministry called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” During the trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for stern international action if North Korea went ahead with its launch plan. Kishida, for his part, urged the North to withdraw its launch plan, but Li didn’t mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. Some observers say that North Korea's satellite launch on the first day of its eight-day window might have been aimed at casting a chill over the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo meeting and registering its displeasure with China. Kim Jong Un has been embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and seeking to boost ties with Beijing and Moscow to forge a united front against Washington, so China's diplomacy with Seoul and Tokyo might have been a disturbing development for Pyongyang. Kim’s primary focus in recent months has been on Russia, as Pyongyang and Moscow — both locked in confrontations with Washington — expand their military cooperation. China, which is much more sensitive about its international reputation, has joined Russia in blocking U.S.-led efforts at the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North but has been less bold and open about supporting Kim's “new Cold War” drive. North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Monday strongly criticized a joint statement issued by Li, Yoon and Kishida, calling them \"wanton interference in its internal affairs.” The ministry took issue with parts of the joint statement that said the three leaders re-emphasized their existing positions on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While North Korea focused much of its criticism on South Korea for allegedly being chiefly responsible for the statement, it's still extremely rare for North Korea to slam a statement signed by China. The failed satellite launch is a blow to Kim's plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 in addition to his country's first military reconnaissance satellite that was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said.",

        "description": "A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported.",
        "content": "A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un's hopes to field satellites to monitor the U.S. and South Korea. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. KCNA cited the unidentified vice director of the National Aerospace Technology Administration as saying that a preliminary examination showed that the explosion was related to the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen-petroleum engine. He said other possible causes will be investigated, according to KCNA. Japan's government briefly issued a missile warning for the southern prefecture of Okinawa, urging residents to take shelter inside buildings and other safer places. The warning was lifted later because the region was no longer in danger, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Asia North Korea's spy satellite launch fails, plunging rocket into ocean Scripps News Staff 4:19 PM, May 30, 2023 North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara called the North’s launch “a serious challenge to the entire world.” South Korea’s Unification Ministry called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” During the trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for stern international action if North Korea went ahead with its launch plan. Kishida, for his part, urged the North to withdraw its launch plan, but Li didn’t mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. Some observers say that North Korea's satellite launch on the first day of its eight-day window might have been aimed at casting a chill over the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo meeting and registering its displeasure with China. Kim Jong Un has been embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and seeking to boost ties with Beijing and Moscow to forge a united front against Washington, so China's diplomacy with Seoul and Tokyo might have been a disturbing development for Pyongyang. Kim’s primary focus in recent months has been on Russia, as Pyongyang and Moscow — both locked in confrontations with Washington — expand their military cooperation. China, which is much more sensitive about its international reputation, has joined Russia in blocking U.S.-led efforts at the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North but has been less bold and open about supporting Kim's “new Cold War” drive. North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Monday strongly criticized a joint statement issued by Li, Yoon and Kishida, calling them \"wanton interference in its internal affairs.” The ministry took issue with parts of the joint statement that said the three leaders re-emphasized their existing positions on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While North Korea focused much of its criticism on South Korea for allegedly being chiefly responsible for the statement, it's still extremely rare for North Korea to slam a statement signed by China. The failed satellite launch is a blow to Kim's plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 in addition to his country's first military reconnaissance satellite that was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday.

        "description": "The Washington Post reports that the former president affirmed his support of Israel and vowed to quell the \"radical revolution\" protesting its actions",
        "content": "Donald Trump recently told a group of donors that if he wins the 2024 presidential election, he will “throw out” students who attend pro-Palestinian protests , according to the Washington Post . “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” Trump said, according to donors at the event, whom the Post did not name. It is unclear if he meant he would throw out all students, regardless of their nationality, or only non-U.S. citizens studying here. Over the past several months, anti-war protests have cropped up at dozens of schools and universities across the country, beginning with Columbia University in New York, where tent enclosures and campus occupations disrupted final weeks of class, canceling its graduation ceremony . Though the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, the NYPD violently cracked down on them, arresting hundreds of people in April and May. (Many of those charges were later dropped, according to the news organization The City .) During the donor event, which per the Post occurred on May 14 in New York City, Trump called the protests a “radical revolution” and commended the NYPD’s reaction to the organizers, which he said “[have] to be stopped now.” If re-elected, he promised, “we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years.” This is not the first time the former president has threatened student protesters. As Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump told attendees at a campaign rally that he would not tolerate foreign students participating in demonstrations. “If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism or antisemitism to our campuses, we will immediately deport you, you’ll be out of that school,” Trump told a crowd in Wildwood, New Jersey on May 11.

Trump Ruled Ineligible for Libertarian Nomination Meet the Drummer Who Spent Decades With David Gilmour and David Crosby — And a Day With Bowie See Bradley Cooper Join Pearl Jam to Sing 'Maybe It's Time' at BottleRock The Black Keys Cancel Upcoming North American Leg of International Players Tour According to the Washington Post, Trump joked at the private donor event that “98 percent of my Jewish friends” were present in the room, and went on to promise support for Israel in the event that he wins in November. He said he believes Israel’s actions to be a justified “war on terror” and as president he would support the country. This is also not the first time he’s expressed support for Israel in the current Gaza war. During an appearance on Fox News in March, Trump said that he was “firmly in Israel’s camp,” and said of Israel’s strikes on Gazans, “you have to finish the problem.” According to Al Jazeera , at least 36,050 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, as have at least 1,139 people in Israel. Though the Post noted that a representative for Trump did not answer detailed questions about their reporting, they did receive an email from the campaign’s national secretary, Karoline Leavitt. “When President Trump is back in the Oval Office, Israel will once again be protected, Iran will go back to being broke, terrorists will be hunted down, and the bloodshed will end,” she wrote.",

        "content": "After nearly half a billion dollars in legal judgments against him this year, Donald Trump ’s company opted to offload one of his private jets this month, public filings show. And the buyer is a Republican megadonor who poured nearly $250,000 into a political committee tied to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The plane, a 1997 Cessna jet, is worth in the range of $10 million, according to evoJets , though terms of the transaction couldn’t be confirmed. Federal Aviation Administration records show that on May 13, the aircraft’s registration changed from the Trump Organization ’s DT Air Corp to a Texas entity called MM Fleet Holdings LLC. State records tie that company to Mehrdad Moayedi, an Iranian-American construction and development tycoon who lives near Dallas and runs Centurion American Custom Homes. According to his biography, Moayedi founded his company in 1990 and has since built thousands of homes. Centurion says it partners with both public and private entities. Moayedi is also a Trump donor. Federal campaign finance data show that in 2019 and 2020, he gave a combined $245,000 to Trump Victory—a committee that raised money for the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee , and state GOP parties—sending the maximum allowable $5,600 contribution to the campaign. Moayedi has also given hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of other GOP candidates and committees, including the RNC, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Nikki Haley . In 2022, the developer made a maximum primary donation of $2,900 to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema , an Arizona independent who has raked in big bucks from the real estate industry and is accused by some Democrats of being overly accommodating to Republicans. Business Insider previously reported that the plane had been sold, though the outlet did not include details about the buyer. Trump has boasted about the Cessna on the Trump Aviation website , writing that the aircraft is a “very special feature within the Trump Aviation fleet.” “This high speed jet is often referred to as a ‘rocket in the sky,’ flying at speeds up to Mach .92 and altitudes as high as 51,000 feet. It is one of the fastest in the world and allows for entry into smaller airports,” the site claims. The site further boasts that the craft is outfitted with “top of the line interiors” that can comfortably seat nine passengers, and that “the signature Trump Crest” on the exterior bestows “an even higher level of luxury and beauty to this magnificent aircraft.” Moayedi could not immediately be reached for comment.",

Dark Fluid is a synthesized exotic matter weaponized by Super Earth scientists to combat the Terminids. Created from technology seized from the Illuminate after the First Galactic War, this substance is intended for a targeted strike to eradicate the Terminid Supercolony on Meridia. Its volatile nature, however, recently caused an unforeseen micro black hole, leading to the tragic incident at the research facility. The Illuminate, one of the three enemy factions from the original Helldivers, have not appeared in Helldivers 2 until now. Rumors and leaks suggest that their destruction might have been exaggerated, leading to speculation about their return. A recent leak depicted a planet, suspected to be Meridia, exploding, which players believe is linked to the Dark Fluid’s instability and the subsequent resurgence of the Illuminate. In March, another leak referenced Illuminate energy readings near the created singularity by Dark Fluid. This has led to theories about the Illuminate’s return, with some believing they were not exterminated but allowed to escape. As Super Earth gears up for a significant operation on Meridia, these leaks and incidents suggest a larger narrative at play, possibly involving the Illuminate’s comeback. Helldivers 2, developed by Arrowhead , is a cooperative top-down that builds on the success of its predecessor. Released in 2024, the game features new enemy factions, advanced weaponry, and strategic elements. Set in a dystopian future, players act as elite soldiers defending Super Earth from various alien threats. The game introduces Dark Fluid, a powerful yet unstable weapon, adding new layers of strategy and danger to the missions. Comparing recent events to past incidents in Helldivers 2, the April 1st victory at Malevelon Creek was overshadowed by an immediate invasion of Automatons. Similarly, Termicide gas, initially seen as a solution, worsened the Terminid problem. These past events mirror the current situation, where the introduction of Dark Fluid has unforeseen consequences, potentially leading to the Illuminate’s unexpected return. The previous major orders in the game have shown that new technologies and strategies often come with significant risks. The deployment of Dark Fluid, despite its potential, has already resulted in casualties and may attract the attention of formidable foes like the Illuminate. This pattern suggests that players should be prepared for the unexpected and ready to adapt to new threats. – The spaghettified scientists hint at the dangers of Dark Fluid. – The Illuminate’s return could add a complex layer to the game. – Past game events show a pattern of initial success followed by greater challenges. As Helldivers 2 players navigate the aftermath of the Dark Fluid incident, they should anticipate escalating challenges. The potential return of the Illuminate could introduce new strategic elements and adversaries, reshaping the game’s landscape. The pattern of past events suggests that while new technologies offer advantages, they also bring unforeseen consequences. Staying vigilant and adaptable will be crucial for players as they face these evolving threats. The ongoing major order and the advancing operations indicate that significant developments are on the horizon, keeping the community engaged and speculative about the game’s future.",

The reality TV star and mother-of-two shared a clip to TikTok where she hops in the water with her 1-year-old son, Phoenix . It's a sweet little video ... capturing loving mom Paris bouncing her baby in what looks like a lazy on a relaxing day -- and, it seems safe. She's holding Phoenix tightly -- and he's happy and smiling -- so all good right? Well, not quite ... 'cause according to a bunch of parents online, PH made a common mistake new moms and dads make -- she's got the life jacket on the wrong way. Check it out ... little vests like the one Phoenix is wearing are supposed to have the big floaty in the front, holding on to the chest -- but, Paris put Phoenix's on so the floaty is on his back. Whoops! This isn't your normal internet call-out BTW ... 'cause lots of the TikTokers genuinely just wanna help Paris, and they're correcting her kindly. Many are admitting they made the same mistake or know people who have -- not a roast by any means. Paris has been super open to these polite corrections in the past FWIW ... remember, just earlier this month fans let Paris know her kids' car seats faced the wrong way -- and, she not only made the change but thanked people for the tips ! Live and learn, we suppose ... it ain't easy being a new mom even if you are a celeb!!! We've reached out to Paris team ... so far, no word back.",

Although OverActive believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements involve risks and uncertainties, and undue reliance should not be placed thereon, as unknown or unpredictable factors could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the OverActive. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include the following: the potential impact of OverActive's qualifying transaction on relationships, including with regulatory bodies, employees, suppliers, customers and competitors; changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; changes in applicable laws and regulations both locally and in foreign jurisdictions; compliance with extensive government regulation; the risks and uncertainties associated with foreign markets; the ability of the Company to continue to execute on its existing partnerships and business strategy; the ability of the MAD Lions and Call of Duty Leagues to maintain viewership; the successful completion of the Company's new venue; and other risk factors set out in OverActive's most recent annual information form and its other filings with Canadian securities regulators, copies of which may be found under OverActive's profile at www.sedarplus.ca .

Non-IFRS Measures This press release includes references to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is defined by the Company net income or loss before income taxes, finance costs, depreciation and amortization, decrease in net present value of franchise obligations, foreign exchange gains / loss, assistance payments from Franchise League and government assistance, restructuring and business development costs, impairment charges, and share-based compensation. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of financial performance because it provides an indication of the Company's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in a cost-effective manner, finance its ongoing operations and service its financial obligations.

Our method of calculating such a financial measure may differ from the methods used by other issuers and, accordingly, our definition of this non-IFRS financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-IFRS financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with IFRS as indicators of our performance or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity and cash flows. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income/loss may be found in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 . Neither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. ____________________________________ i Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.

        "content": "South Sydney superstar Latrell Mitchell boldly declared “I bleed blue” amid claims he gave New South Wales coach Michael Maguire the impression he wasn’t committed to representing his state. Despite the Rabbitohs’ poor start to the 2024 season, Mitchell loomed as a potential selection for the Blues ahead of Origin Game I but Maguire opted for Stephen Crichton and Joseph Sua’ali’i in the centres. The Daily Telegraph’s Phil Rothfield, however, reported on a meeting , with the latter believing the Bunnies star “wasn’t overly obsessed” about playing for the Blues. “I had mail last week that he might have had a meeting with Madge and Madge walked away from that meeting with an opinion that he (Latrell) wasn’t overly obsessed about wearing the Blues jersey,” Rothfield said. “He (Mitchell) was dreadfully concerned about the trainwreck season that is South Sydney and I think after they spoke, Madge was of the opinion he wants guys who aren’t concerned about club footy and want to do their best for the state. But Mitchell fired back on Instagram and declared he’s always willing to represent his state when called upon. “I’m always committed to playing for NSW,” Mitchell wrote. “Facts. I specifically said to Madge via phone call if I’m playing well enough for me to be in your side, then I’m 100 per cent in. “I bleed blue, I love the rivalry and the Origin arena. All I can do now is focus on Souths and winning more games. “Good luck to the boys ... I’ll be cheering NSW all the way.” Mitchell has not played for the Blues since 2021 as a hamstring injury ruled him out of the 2022 series while a calf injury sidelined him in 2023. However, the 26-year-old could figure as a selection candidate for Game II if he can string together a series of performances similar to what he showed in the Bunnies’ 42-26 victory over the Eels. Mitchell chalked up three try assists and was a livewire throughout as the Rabbitohs secured just their second win of the season.",

        "content": "The Guardians are for real. Major League Baseball says so in its updated power rankings revealed May 26. Bleacher Report also says so by the same metric. The oddsmakers in Las Vegas agree. The visible proof is in the American League Central Division standings, and the measure of the Guardians’ success goes deeper than the record of 36-17 that has them in first place, 2.5 games ahead of the Royals. Bleacher Report and MLB each rank the Guardians third among baseball’s 30 teams, behind only the Phillies and Yankees. The Guardians before the 2024 season began were pegged at +300 by BetMGM.com to win the Central Division, meaning a bettor would win $300 and recoup the original $100 if the bet wins. Anyone can still bet on the Guardians to win the Central, but the odds have changed. Dramatically. Now they are minus-110, meaning it would take a bet of $110 to win $100 and recoup the original $100. The Guardians were 24-29 after 53 games last season. The A.L. Central was so anemic they were just 3.5 games behind the division-leading Twins at 28-26. A team with a record of 24-29 in the division today would be 12 games behind the Guardians. Check out these numbers: The Guardians have scored 263 runs, fifth most in the majors, and they have homered 59 times — good for 10th. After 53 games last year they had scored 183 runs and homered 30 times. The Guardians won nine straight games, their longest winning streak since 2017 when they won 22 straight, before playing the Rockies in Denver on May 27. They have won 12 of their last 13 games. Remarkably, they have put together this amazing run while their leadoff hitter, Steven Kwan, is recovering from a hamstring injury that forced him to the injured list May 6. Kwan was leading the American League with a .353 batting average when he was sidelined. Even more remarkable than winning without Kwan is they are winning with a first-year manager who just two years ago was behind the plate catching for the A’s. Stephen Vogt was unknown to most Guardians fans before he was hired to replace legendary Terry Francona. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti admitted knowing little about Vogt before he and General Manager Mike Chernoff began their search for the 47th manager in franchise history. The early report card on Vogt: So far, so very good. “I haven’t done anything,” Vogt answered a reporter in Anaheim on May 26 when asked about managing a team on a nine-game win streak. “It’s all about the guys in (the clubhouse). They believe in each other. They fight for each other. We play all 13 (positional players) guys. “They all chip in on their day. The pitching has really stepped up. It’s been a fun week and a half. We want to keep it going.” What Vogt said is not true. Not the part about the Guardians believing in each other and fighting for each other. That part is definitely true. The “I haven’t done anything” part of Vogt’s statement is inaccurate, yet his in-game decisions aren’t the main reason there has been a 12-game improvement from a year ago with basically the same everyday lineup — not counting Tyler Freeman replacing Myles Straw in center field. Freeman has homered four times in 48 games. Straw homered three times in 359 career games with Cleveland over three seasons. Vogt’s philosophy on hitting differs from that of Francona. Francona, 64 when he retired as manager, was big on his players making contact, pushing the runner up a base or two with another hit, and running the bases wisely. Vogt wants his hitters to be more aggressive at the plate. The results show in the numbers — 29 more home runs and 80 more runs scored after 53 games from 2023 to 2024. “It’s been a theme going back to spring training,” Antonetti said recently. “We were looking to try to impact the ball more consistently. “I think maybe we fell victim a little bit to the narrative around our identity about, ‘Hey, we’re a team that just puts the ball in play.’ And yes, that’s a strength and we want to make sure we maintain that, but the goal is to try to put the ball in play with authority. Let’s put the ball in play when we can, but let’s look to try to do a little bit more damage when we do.” Credit hitting coach Chris Valaika, too. The Guardians were dead last in the majors with 124 home runs last year, but they also struck out a Major League-fewest 1,142 times. The 2024 Guards have not sacrificed plate discipline for swinging aggressively. The Guardians have fanned 403 times this season. Only the Royals, Blue Jays and Astros have struck out fewer times.",

        "content": "Coming off their first loss of the season and travelling away against Eden, the Pakuranga United Rugby Club Premiers were expecting a tough encounter last Saturday. They started well with an early exchange into the Eden red zone after some welcomed physicality from Pasqualle Dunne. An error let Eden off the hook early and a big clearing kick by the home side showed ‘Ranga what was to come if they didn’t control the football. Eden kicked a penalty to make it 3–0 before ‘Ranga came back hard. Strong forwards play with a good maul off a shortened lineout led into Eden’s 30m zone. Constant pressure and large phases with good ball control and great ruck work saw an amazing try to George Sims. A missed conversion and the score was 5–3 Pakuranga. Eden entered the Pakuranga 30-metre zone and a penalty was given for offside play. Eden converted to make it 6–5. Two minutes later Pakuranga were awarded a scrum penalty in a kickable position. Michiale van Wyk converted to make the score 8–6 at halftime. Another attack from the backs had Ezekiel Wye pop up on off his left wing to receive an inside pass to score a great try. Van Wyk converted to make it 15–6. Eden kicked the ball to five metres out and the ensuing lineout had them over for a try, which was converted to make it 15–13 in Pakuranga’s favour. Eden then infringed 40 metres out and directly in front. Van Wyk stepped up to have a shot but the ball drifted so the score stayed 15–13. Eden converted a penalty to make it 16–15 but Pakuranga didn’t panic. The insertion of Gafatasi Su’s at hooker for Lotu Finau all game was timely. Combined with loosehead Oscar Cowley-Andreas and Jerry Samania the ‘Ranga scrum became lethal. Phases built from a lineout in Eden territory and Sean Carter crashed over for what some saw as a controversial try. Sims stepped up to convert it to make it 22–16. Randall Baker came on late and decimated the Eden lineout stealing ball at will. Pakuranga finished the game with an opportunity to go for a maul to secure a bonus point or take a shot at goal. Sione Takai rightly chose the latter option. The final score was 22–16 to Pakuranga. It was a much-needed victory after their first loss of the season the week before. Senior rugby takes a break this weekend to celebrate King’s Birthday. Everyone’s welcome along on June 8 to support the boys versus Waitakere where they hope to secure their position in the top two of the competition.",

        "content": "The Portland Trail Blazers issued a statement Monday in response to the death of one of the . “Bill Walton was a true legend - an extraordinary player, talented broadcaster, and vital part of the Blazers organization,” the statement read. “His mastery of the game not only established him as one of the greatest centers in history, but also led the Blazers to a championship in 1977, where he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player. But Bill was so much more than basketball, he was larger than life. His upbeat and vibrant personality will forever be remembered and cherished, and he will be deeply missed by our organization, Rip City and all who experienced him. Our love and condolences go to Bill’s wife, Lori and his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris.” Walton died at the age of 71. The statement also included a comment from Blazers chair, Jody Allen. “Bill Walton was an icon,” Allen said. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The 6-foot-11 Walton led the Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award after averaging 18.5 points, 19 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 3.7 blocks. He shot 54.5% in the six-game series against the Philadelphia 76ers. -- Aaron Fentress | | (Twitter), (Instagram), (Facebook)",

        "content": "Hundreds of people, as well as the mayor of Toronto, the city’s police chief and municipal and provincial politicians, turned out in the pouring rain on May 27 to demonstrate their support for the Bais Chaya Mushka Elementary School. Shots were fired at the building just before 5 a.m. on May 25, breaking a window in front of the school, said Toronto Police. In a security video two suspects can be seen getting out of a dark-coloured vehicle—which neither of them appeared to be driving—and opening rounds of fire on the fenced-in building at 4375 Chesswood Dr., near the intersection of Dufferin and Finch. The Integrated Gun and Gang Task Force, with the help of the Hate Crime Unit are investigating, Toronto Police said in a news release. Bais Chaya Mushka had recently spent $200,000 to put in specially armoured glass and other renovations. Half the funding came from the federal government’s Security Infrastructure Program (SIP) grant. Rabbi Yaakov Vidal, principal of the Chabad Lubavitch elementary school, located in an industrial area in northwest Toronto, said he learned of the incident on Shabbat afternoon, when the school’s caretaker came to his home to inform him. “It was pretty shocking, it was something that’s totally unexpected,” he said in an interview with The CJN, shortly before the community rally and the arrival of students. “But we’ve got to move forward and makes sure the kids can come back to school. “Parents are concerned, but we’re grateful to have all the security we have here, the police force, and the reassurance that they’re going to be here with us until safety is restored.” I will never see our Jewish Community surrender to hate and acts of antisemistism. My colleagues and I joined together united at Bais Chaya Mushka School in #yorkcentre with a clear message. Every student has a right to learn safely without fear here in our Ontario. pic.twitter.com/xRD8gfJNG5 — Michael Kerzner (@MPPKerzner) May 27, 2024 Municipal and provincial politicians spoke to the crowd outside the school as parents and school buses dropped off children. “My word to the hater, to the shooter, is it’s a despicable, antisemitic act. It was a disgusting attempt to intimidate the community, to fill people with fear and we say to these cowards we will find you. You will be held responsible,” said Mayor Olivia Chow. “The chief (of police, Myron Demkiw) and I have spoken and his team is working every minute of every day to keep you and your loved ones safe in our city. They will be increasing their presence around schools and synagogues and other places where you and your family gather.” Mayor @oliviachow speaking this morning outside Bais Chaya Mushka Jewish Elementary School. 👇 pic.twitter.com/UPzyT2UmW9 — HonestReporting Canada🎗️ (@HonestRepCanada) May 27, 2024 The city has convened meetings with city staff and police to evaluate the security needs of schools and other institutions, the mayor told The CJN, starting with the Miles Nadal JCC in downtown Toronto. “We said let’s identify what needs to be done and where there’s a will, there’s always a way,” Chow told The CJN when asked whether the city would offer funding for security improvements. Several MPPs and city councillors expressed their support for the Jewish community. “I want to speak to the non-Jewish community who is with us today... to stand up and speak up against the vile rise of antisemitism being normalized on the streets of this country. To stand up to those who seek to instill fear in the hearts of young girls and children,” provincial education minister Stephen Lecce told the crowd. “We are not going to be intimidated by these acts, because there is no bully that can shatter our resolve as a country to stand up against this pernicious hate.” Proud to stand with colleagues, the community and allies to show our support for the students at this school, and to show we will not be intimidated.

The motion failed to pass at a council meeting last week. “We’re not finished asking for bubble zones in front of our vulnerable institutions. To those who thought this debate was over, we’ll be back,” Pasternak told the crowd to cheers. Today, members from all level of government came out to show their support at a @UJAFederation rally in support of Bais Chaya Mushka All-Girls Jewish Elementary School. We will continue to fight for safety bubble zones to protect faith-baised schools and institutions from hate.... pic.twitter.com/WzYttY6ETr — James Pasternak (@PasternakTO) May 27, 2024 Parents dropping their children off at the school Monday morning said it was hard to tell their children about the shooting—and to see the boarded-up window that had been pierced by a bullet. “It’s difficult to swallow,” said Rivky Gansburg, who has three daughters at the school. “My daughter’s classroom, her Grade 8 classroom, is right above where the shooting happened. I often pull up to school during the day and the girls are at that window, waving, smiling during a break. “There’s no reason why anybody should attack children who are coming to learn and go about their day.” Tamar Liman said it was frightening to hear the news about the shooting on the weekend, but by Monday morning, encouraged by the rally, she said her children were not worried about returning to school, “I think they have faith in the police, faith in God and faith in the community to stand together,” she said. The shooting at the school is the most recent attack on a Jewish institution in Toronto. Earlier this month, the windows and doors at Synagogue Kehillat Shaarei Torah were broken in an attack. It was the second time the Orthodox synagogue had been vandalized within weeks. Two schools and a community building in Montreal were targeted by a shooter in November. Last week, Montreal police announced they had arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting at Yeshiva Gedola, a Montreal school. “This needs to be a wake-up call for our leaders and for broader society,” said Noah Shack, UJA Federation vice-president for countering hate and antisemitism. “For a school to be shot at is unconscionable. “Antisemitism is diminished when those in positions of authority speak out against it. You saw a lot of that here today, and what we need is more of that from our leaders. “We need them to take clear positions that this will not stand... The time for equivocation needs to be over now.”",

        "content": "Politics / Biden's Desperate Bid to Reclaim the Youth Vote Is Missing the Point President Joe Biden tries on a pair of sunglasses on May 21, 2024, in Nashua, New Hampshire. (Robert F. Bukaty / AP Photo) President Joe Biden has stepped up efforts to reverse his disastrous loss of support among young voters, announcing a new round of cancellations for federal student loans. The initiative, covering $77 billion in debts, will forgive loans for some 160,000 borrowers via existing programs—a total that brings the overall ratio of canceled loans to one in 10, or 5 million borrowers, according to administration officials. The new program comes on the heels of the White House's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule 3 drug, in order to reduce criminal penalties for its use—and just ahead of the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the parent company of Ticketmaster, whose price gouging is the bane of music fans. It's hard to avoid the sense that this grab bag of policy incentives is a desperate bid by Biden reelection strategists to divert attention from the main issue throttling his support among voters in the 18-to-34 demographic: his bear-hug support for Israel's brutal and inhumane war in Gaza, whose grip has only recently begun to loosen with his threats to withhold US military aid in the event of an Israeli offensive in Rafah. If only we can hunt up enough spare income for kids to get high with at concerts, Biden campaign officials seem to reckon, then they'll forget about this damn war and the cowardly nationwide crackdown on campus protests against it. There's a deeper irony embedded in these don't-look-at-Gaza pitches to young voters. In reprising the Biden White House's earlier overtures toward policies aimed at ameliorating inequality for younger Americans, Biden's campaign is treating them the same way that presidential candidates have historically sidled up to older voters—giving them one-off, interest-group emollients to nail down their... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

        "content": "Politics / Biden's Desperate Bid to Reclaim the Youth Vote Is Missing the Point President Joe Biden tries on a pair of sunglasses on May 21, 2024, in Nashua, New Hampshire. (Robert F. Bukaty / AP Photo) President Joe Biden has stepped up efforts to reverse his disastrous loss of support among young voters, announcing a new round of cancellations for federal student loans. The initiative, covering $77 billion in debts, will forgive loans for some 160,000 borrowers via existing programs—a total that brings the overall ratio of canceled loans to one in 10, or 5 million borrowers, according to administration officials. The new program comes on the heels of the White House's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule 3 drug, in order to reduce criminal penalties for its use—and just ahead of the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the parent company of Ticketmaster, whose price gouging is the bane of music fans. It's hard to avoid the sense that this grab bag of policy incentives is a desperate bid by Biden reelection strategists to divert attention from the main issue throttling his support among voters in the 18-to-34 demographic: his bear-hug support for Israel's brutal and inhumane war in Gaza, whose grip has only recently begun to loosen with his threats to withhold US military aid in the event of an Israeli offensive in Rafah. If only we can hunt up enough spare income for kids to get high with at concerts, Biden campaign officials seem to reckon, then they'll forget about this damn war and the cowardly nationwide crackdown on campus protests against it. There's a deeper irony embedded in these don't-look-at-Gaza pitches to young voters. In reprising the Biden White House's earlier overtures toward policies aimed at ameliorating inequality for younger Americans, Biden's campaign is treating them the same way that presidential candidates have historically sidled up to older voters—giving them one-off, interest-group emollients to nail down their... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

(George Pickow/Three Lions via Getty) Surf roaring over the black streak of a lost fishing net, the protracted struggle to retrieve it from the smothering sea, jagged cliffs and the fight to sustain a bare existence—so begins 1934's Man of Aran, which follows the subsistence struggles of a coastal Irish community. It wasn't the first documentary, but it was made by the first documentarian, Robert Flaherty, whose film Nanook of the North (1922) is widely considered to have inaugurated the genre despite his habit of fabricating characters and plotlines to romanticize \"primitive\" cultures. Books in review Whale Fall Buy this book Flaherty explained that his very mission as a filmmaker was \"to show the former majesty and character of these people, while it is still possible.\" It was also what audiences wanted to see: Nanook was a global hit. Its legacy in the Canadian Arctic—where Flaherty slept with at least one of the film's Inuk stars and then abandoned their son—was more complex, but by then, he had moved on. After a documentary set on a Samoan island flopped, Flaherty decided to try his luck on Ireland's wind-scoured outskirts. There, he and his crew spent two years following unrelated islanders chosen to portray \"a man of Aran,\" \"his wife,\" and \"their son\" as they clamber over house-sized boulders to scavenge seaweed, teeter on the edge of cliffs with a fishing line, and subdue a thrashing shark from a ramshackle rowboat. Man of Aran won praise abroad but was criticized even at the time for its lack of attention to social context; later commentators exposed much of it as fraudulent. Still, Flaherty's participants were mysteriously committed to the film. \"He won me and won my soul out of me as well,\" said Pat Mullen, who interpreted for his Irish-speaking neighbors. No one filmed what happened behind Flaherty's camera,... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

        "content": "Books & the Arts / The Imperial Gaze Turns on Britain's Isles A woman gazes towards the Irish mainland from the Aran Islands around 1950. (George Pickow/Three Lions via Getty) Surf roaring over the black streak of a lost fishing net, the protracted struggle to retrieve it from the smothering sea, jagged cliffs and the fight to sustain a bare existence—so begins 1934's Man of Aran, which follows the subsistence struggles of a coastal Irish community. It wasn't the first documentary, but it was made by the first documentarian, Robert Flaherty, whose film Nanook of the North (1922) is widely considered to have inaugurated the genre despite his habit of fabricating characters and plotlines to romanticize \"primitive\" cultures. Books in review Whale Fall Buy this book Flaherty explained that his very mission as a filmmaker was \"to show the former majesty and character of these people, while it is still possible.\" It was also what audiences wanted to see: Nanook was a global hit. Its legacy in the Canadian Arctic—where Flaherty slept with at least one of the film's Inuk stars and then abandoned their son—was more complex, but by then, he had moved on. After a documentary set on a Samoan island flopped, Flaherty decided to try his luck on Ireland's wind-scoured outskirts. There, he and his crew spent two years following unrelated islanders chosen to portray \"a man of Aran,\" \"his wife,\" and \"their son\" as they clamber over house-sized boulders to scavenge seaweed, teeter on the edge of cliffs with a fishing line, and subdue a thrashing shark from a ramshackle rowboat. Man of Aran won praise abroad but was criticized even at the time for its lack of attention to social context; later commentators exposed much of it as fraudulent. Still, Flaherty's participants were mysteriously committed to the film. \"He won me and won my soul out of me as well,\" said Pat Mullen, who interpreted for his Irish-speaking neighbors. No one filmed what happened behind Flaherty's camera,... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

        "content": "Books & the Arts / A Coming of Age Novel That Puzzles Through Gender Edward Hopper's October in Cape Cod, 1946. (Photo by VCG Wilson / Corbis via Getty Images) Bitterness is much easier than community. Living in harmony with those different from us can often seem dangerous. In his new novel, Some Strange Music Draws Me In, Griffin Hansbury tells the story of a trans woman's fated arrival in a small town that considers even Michael Jackson a gateway drug. Hansbury has previously written nonfiction works under the pseudonym Jeremiah Moss, many of which deal with the effects of gentrification and life in New York City. Some Strange Music, however, takes us to rural Massachusetts, where Sylvia, the trans woman in question, haunts and agitates this bucolic landscape. Through Sylvia, \"Mel\" (in 1984) and \"Max\" (in 2019) slowly falls under the spell of Lou Reed and drag. Culture is Mel's way to become Max and escape the small town of Swaffham. Some Strange Music alternates between the formative summer when Mel and Sylvia first meet and Max's subsequent life as an adult trans man once again living in his hometown. Books in review Some Strange Music Draws Me in Buy this book When Sylvia moves to Swaffham from New York, \"the tranny\" begins to disrupt everyone's ability to bury their gender anxiety. She's in town to sell the house she has inherited from her mother, a task that proves to be impossible once the townspeople begin a campaign of harassment: on the streets, in public bathrooms, and while she's driving around in her truck. It's easier for the locals to label Sylvia a pedophile than to examine their own fears. But Mel ends up tracking Sylvia down anyway, intent on understanding the \"strange music\" she feels around the tall woman who dresses like a punk.

        "content": "Books & the Arts / A Coming of Age Novel That Puzzles Through Gender Edward Hopper's October in Cape Cod, 1946. (Photo by VCG Wilson / Corbis via Getty Images) Bitterness is much easier than community. Living in harmony with those different from us can often seem dangerous. In his new novel, Some Strange Music Draws Me In, Griffin Hansbury tells the story of a trans woman's fated arrival in a small town that considers even Michael Jackson a gateway drug. Hansbury has previously written nonfiction works under the pseudonym Jeremiah Moss, many of which deal with the effects of gentrification and life in New York City. Some Strange Music, however, takes us to rural Massachusetts, where Sylvia, the trans woman in question, haunts and agitates this bucolic landscape. Through Sylvia, \"Mel\" (in 1984) and \"Max\" (in 2019) slowly falls under the spell of Lou Reed and drag. Culture is Mel's way to become Max and escape the small town of Swaffham. Some Strange Music alternates between the formative summer when Mel and Sylvia first meet and Max's subsequent life as an adult trans man once again living in his hometown. Books in review Some Strange Music Draws Me in Buy this book When Sylvia moves to Swaffham from New York, \"the tranny\" begins to disrupt everyone's ability to bury their gender anxiety. She's in town to sell the house she has inherited from her mother, a task that proves to be impossible once the townspeople begin a campaign of harassment: on the streets, in public bathrooms, and while she's driving around in her truck. It's easier for the locals to label Sylvia a pedophile than to examine their own fears. But Mel ends up tracking Sylvia down anyway, intent on understanding the \"strange music\" she feels around the tall woman who dresses like a punk. Sylvia takes Mel swimming and tells her about Andy Warhol and Candy Darling before introducing her to Patti Smith's landmark record Horses, which awakens something in Mel that she can never put away: \"Maybe just... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

In so doing, he moved the country a little closer to his ultimate goal of reading the Reconstruction amendments right out of the Constitution. He did this through a case called Alexander v.

It's historically been a safe district for Republicans, but in 2018 a Democrat, Joe Cunningham took the seat with just 50.6 percent of the vote.

In 2020, Nancy Mace narrowly defeated Cunningham to retake the seat for Republicans, but by the same razor thin margin. To avoid these kinds of close scrapes in the future, Republicans redrew the district after the 2020 census, and Mace won reelection with 56.4 percent of the vote in 2022. The way South Carolina redrew the map, however, was racist. Republicans accomplished the goal of protecting Mace by systematically removing Black voters from her district. The new map splits the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in two, and takes most of the Black voters who live there out of District 1 and puts them in District 6 (which is currently represented by Representative Jim Clyburn and is the only one of the state's seven districts currently held by a Democrat).

They are likely to be larger than current juvenile visitors and while many will be welcome, some will not, such as the venomous Portuguese man o' war, the world's second most lethal ctenophore. Already there are signs some creatures are going from seasonal to native visitors as extreme marine heatwaves set some species off course. Deadly box jellyfish are becoming increasingly common as well as weever fish, the UK's only venomous fish. We can also expect to see more shortfin mako, the world's fastest swimming shark and now a regular sighting offshore around southern Britain.

Frankie Hobro, director of Anglesey Sea Zoo, Brynsiencyn, believes some creatures may pose a greater risk to beachgoers, prompting a need for greater awareness of marine medicine. She told the Daily Star: \"With an overall warmer sea around us here in the UK for much of the year, we will see an increase in certain exotic species, as creatures which were once occasional vagrants become regular seasonal visitors or even natives in our waters.

An RNLI crew arrived on scene to find the vessel \"almost totally destroyed\" and its occupant \"disappearing under the surface\". Emergency services including rescue helicopters were alerted to the incident shortly after 7pm on Saturday, May 25. A member of the public raised the alarm after seeing smoke in the distance whilst in Stackpole, Pembrokeshire. An all-weather lifeboat from Tenby RNLI was launched and, as the crew rounded St Margaret's Island, south of Tenby, they too spotted smoke on the horizon some 12 miles further south.

        "content": "Upgraded parking facilities at a notorious beauty spot on the edge of Eryri (Snowdonia) are backfiring, critics have claimed. Locals say parking issues have worsened since \"improvements\" were implemented at Y Glyn, an area known as \"the lagoons\" by Llyn Padarn in Llanberis. Three adjacent car park areas were resurfaced to provide 114 parking spaces and a separate aires-type \"Arosfan\" facility was created for campervans. Cyngor Gwynedd carried out the work to bring \"order and control\" to an area that at times becomes overwhelmed with visitors. But with pay machines not yet working, and height barriers only sporadically operated, local people say the car parks have become a giant \"campsite\". Two weeks ago, 95 campervans were counted overnighting at the site and, despite a ban, 32 tents. READ MORE: The illicit 'hidden green lagoon' that lures people despite warnings of what lies beneath READ MORE: Butlin's interested in coming to North Wales seaside town but there's one problem With more expected over the Bank Holiday weekend, locals are braced for more bedlam at a much-loved leisure facility. As well as struggling for parking space, there are concerns over littering and, for volunteer rubbish collectors, the prospect of finding more human faeces. Nearby campsite owners are incensed too, as Llyn Padarn's \"free campsite\" is said to be sucking custom from their facilities. While many campervan owners prefer the freedom of unrestricted pitches, campsite operators between Llanberis and Caernarfon are reporting lower-than-usual occupancy figures for motorhomes. \"This is ruining local family businesses!\" fumed one owner, down 10 pitches last weekend. Residents insist they are not anti-tourist but they want Cyngor Gwynedd to get a grip and restore the \"order\" they were promised. The council said a security company would be returning this summer to monitor the area during weekends and over the school holidays. Work is due to start next week on getting payment machines...",

        "content": "Something went wrong, please try again later. Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later. Something went wrong, please try again later. It's that time of year when intriguing and sometimes perilous creatures begin to populate our coasts. But what should you do if you encounter a beached jellyfish, and can they still sting you after they've died? Whether you're fascinated or repulsed by them, jellyfish are captivating creatures that play a crucial role in the marine food chain. They are entirely dependent on currents for transportation, which is why they often appear in large groups, reports the Daily Star. But with so many benign species being easily mistaken for the more nasty ones, and vice versa, the golden rule is always look but don't touch. Whilst in the water you should also keep your distance – the tentacles often drift a long way behind the main body of the animal, which is what makes them such effective predators.

Watch out for the stingers The harmless By-The-Wind-Sailors bear a great similarity to their much maligned and much larger relative the Portuguese Man O' War. Both have a float above the surface with a striking bluish purple 'sail' to catch the wind. Most impressive in size among our common species are lionsmane and barrel jellyfish, both of which frequently grow to the size of a dustbin lid or larger and are a staple food for our native leatherback turtles. The barrel jellyfish is harmless to humans but is still a formidable sight, a dense white mass with short tentacles which often grow to the size of a barrel, hence their name. Similarly the lionsmane jellyfish reaches 2m in diameter and gives a very nasty sting,...",

Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail Nine beaches in Wales have been singled out for their beauty and \"secrecy\". They are included in a list of 13 UK beaches that, viewed from a London perspective, are seen as being \"off the beaten track\". Locals and even holidaymakers may be surprised to learn the rundown includes beaches with \"virtually no tourists\" - true for some only in the off-season. The list was compiled by The Express, which said: \"Although a few of these iconic places can be reached by coach or car, others can only be accessed at certain times of the day or via precipitous footpaths.\" While those picked out are undeniably beautiful, not all are quite as inaccessible as The Express believes. Some are indeed \"hidden away in remote coves\" but few remain undiscovered and many can become quite busy in high summer. Pick the right time, however, and you may have these beaches almost to yourself. READ MORE: Butlin's interested in coming to North Wales seaside town but there's one problem READ MORE: 'Toxic' Welsh tourist tax survives axe as country battles 'over-tourism' Still, the list includes beaches that can be trickier to reach. A few, said The Express, can \"only be reached on foot\", which is largely true of most beaches: exceptions includes the likes of Morfa Bychan (Black Rock Sands) near Porthmadog. All are definitely worth a visit, however. Details of each are outlined below. (Image: Jeff Buck/Wiki) Also referred to by its Anglicised name, Church Bay, this is an expanse of sand and pebbles beach bordered by rock pools against a backdrop of steep cliffs. Reviewers rate the beach for its \"amazing views\" and for providing \"plenty of room for everyone\"....",

Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail Two villages in North Wales have been named among the \"greatest\" in Britain. A 2024 list of the country's 30 best villages, from Gwynedd to Cumbria and Cornwall, has been compiled by The Telegraph. While most are, unsurprisingly, in England, four from Wales are included and just three from Scotland. When drawing up the shortlist, the newspaper placed an emphasis on beauty and authenticity, singling out places not overrun by tourists. Introducing its selection, The Telegraph said: \"Britain has no shortage of eye-catching villages, but a combination of good looks, convenience for day trippers and a few influential endorsements can be enough to turn what was once a peaceful retreat into an overtourism battleground inundated with selfie stick-wielding tourists from April till October.

Of the four Welsh picks, they're neatly divided between north and south. Representing South Wales are Solva, Pembrokeshire, with its \"ice-cream pastels\" and \"fjord-like harbour\", and Laugharne on the River Taf in Carmarthenshire, host to a castle ruin, old walls and reminders of poet Dylan Thomas.

        "content": "The unsolved murder of a pensioner, who was brutally beaten to death in his own home, has baffled investigators for four decades. Retired dentist John Connors, described by a friend as \"so thin you could have pushed him over with a feather\", was killed in his Neath home in 1978, sparking a massive manhunt for the perpetrator or perpetrators. As part of their investigation, police released a sketch of a man seen fleeing from Mr Connors' residence on the day of his death before jumping into a car and speeding away. However, this individual has never been identified, leaving the murder case unresolved. Mr Connors lived on Lewis Road in Neath town centre in the shadow of the landmark \"penny brick\" church. The house had also served as his dental surgery before his retirement. The 85-year-old lived alone and while he enjoying popping into the British Legion club for a drink with friends, he largely kept himself to himself. However, sometime on the afternoon or evening of Thursday, March 30, 1978, he was bludgeoned to death, reports Wales Online.

He had been repeatedly beaten about the head with what a post mortem examination would later determine had been two different blunt objects. It was said his death was likely swift, though \"defensive wounds\" to his hands showed he had put up some resistance despite his physical frailties. A number of small fires had been set in the room where the body was discovered - possibly lit in an attempt to cover the killer's tracks - and while it appeared nothing had been taken from the house detectives were sure the motive had been robbery. There was also no sign of a forced entry to the property, suggesting Mr Connors may have let his killers...",

If you're planning a summer getaway this year, Manchester Airport offers a range of more affordable alternatives. Despite the cost-of-living crisis, a foreign break is still possible for those canny enough to look around for deals. A recent survey by the European Travel Commission revealed that, despite the ongoing financial strain, nearly three-quarters of Brits are planning to travel in the next six months. There are time-honoured ways to cut costs, such as travelling at off-peak times for lower air fares and hotel rates. But just choosing less-familiar destinations can also make a big difference to what's possible.

Lined by trees, with a farmhouse reminiscent of an \"Italian villa\" nearby, the \"beautiful' sandy beach was flanked by moorland and dunes that have since become part of a nature reserve.

        "content": "Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail For years Wales has been trying to shrug off its bucket-and-spade image in the hope of attracting wealthier holidaymakers and extending the tourism season. A new study suggests the country is slowly making headway in the battle to be considered a \"luxury staycation destination\". For getaway visitors seeking relative solitude, \"remoteness\" was factored into the study by considering local population data. By this measure, four Welsh counties – Anglesey, Pembrokeshire, Gwynedd and Ceredigion – were placed within the top 14 UK of Britain's staycation areas. While they were behind big hitters such as the Lake District and Cotswolds, all four came out ahead of key players like Devon and Edinburgh. Luxury is, of course, subjective and the criteria used to assess it can be arbitrary. A survey by Defender, a Land Rover brand with its own premium cachet, based its assessment on things like golf courses, five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants. The resulting list will inform recommendations for the company's customers.

        "content": "A pop-up campsite launched on Anglesey just two years ago has quickly evolved into something rather more eye-catching. As well as offering year-round camping and glamping, the site now hosts wedding guests, music events and a forest school. Last year guests were offered archery and tree-top swings, and this season's line-up includes hedge foraging, immersive theatre, flower workshops and al fresco massages. Seren-y-Môr (Star of the Sea), a wild camping site next to ancient woodland, also just to happens to offer spectacular views off the north Anglesey coast. The setting for the venture is the Carreglwyd Estate, near Llanfaethlu, whose history pre-dates the Glyndŵr rebellion of the 15th century. Originally established as a reed thatching estate, for centuries it's been home to sheep and cattle as part of Anglesey's rich farming heritage. The old reedbed marsh is now a SSSI with a diverse array of wildlife.

During the Covid pandemic, the staycation boom prompted Laura Carpenter – daughter of the estate owner – to launch Seren-y-Môr. Its popularity encouraged her to add a forest school and other outdoor pursuits to appeal to families and the adventurous. The forest school is run by Nina and Bob Roots – Bob works on the estate advise its eco-conscious owners on the ecology of their woodlands and marshes. Nina said: \"During Covid, people weren't able to go abroad and Anglesey became one of the UK's top destinations to go on holiday. People were looking for something a bit more wild, and it was really sunny, which was great. \"The estate owners wanted to start a campsite, so they selected two large fields overlooking the coast.

He tore the anterior cruciate in his left knee during a preseason game against the Seahawks and spent the year working with Cowboys rehab specialist Britt Brown. “ , the recovery process and the rehab process with Britt,” Overshown told Clarence Hill of the . “Everything’s been great. That’s why I’m really confident in how I’m going to play this year. The hard work we put in. It was days where it was just us at the facility — me, the guys that tore their ACL and Britt. We were there while everybody else was on vacation. This rehab, this recovery definitely has been one that I feel like it’s going to add years to my career at the end. This actually saved my career, this injury.” The third-round pick in 2023 entered the NFL as a 220-pounder. He is heavier now, adding 12-13 pounds of lean mass and has a goal of opening the season at 233 or 234 pounds. “I feel so much more powerful. I’m so much stronger. I feel like I have gotten faster,” Overshown said. “I feel and look like a linebacker now. I can finally stop answering the question: Are you a safety or linebacker? I’m a linebacker that played safety. Don’t get it twisted. I got my frame and I’m ready to get out there. People ain’t seen me this big. They seen a little DeeMo. They haven’t seen the big DeeMo. People are going to be scared of this DeeMo.” Overshown is playing weak side linebacker in the new defense under coordinator Mike Zimmer, with free agent signee Eric Kendricks in the middle and Damone Clark at strong side linebacker. With Overshown’s return, and Kendricks’ signing, linebacker is the one position where the Cowboys have upgraded this offseason. “I feel like all of our linebackers can be All-Pros and Pro Bowlers,” Overshown said. “One thing I know is that run is not going to be a problem. Being around Zimmer, he loves coaching ball and we are constantly learning. One thing that I really respect about coach is he’s teaching us the ins and outs of his defense. He is going to let you know what you are not doing right and he is going to show you. I know I our defense is going to be a lot better this year.”",

        "content": "Queen Camilla honours late brother in sweet way (Image: Getty) Queen Camilla has managed to keep her late brother, Mark Shand's memory alive in a sweet way that is still going strong today, ten years after his death. Mark Shand - a British travel writer and conservationist - died on April 23, 2014 , after he tripped and struck his head as he was trying to light a cigarette outside a hotel in New York following a fundraising auction, at the age of 62. At the time, Camilla spoke to the Times about the moment she answered the phone to find out the devastating news, saying: \"An anguished voice on the other end told me that something terrible had happened to my indestructible brother. \"My charismatic and sometimes infuriating brother, who had survived tsunamis, shipwrecks, poisoned arrows and even the fearsome Komodo dragons, was no longer with us.\" function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) But it looks like even after all those years since his passing, the Queen has worked hard to keep her beloved brother's memory alive, with the support of her husband, King Charles .

        "description": "Delbert Kohler survived the Bataan Death March, but not captivity, while Russell Haukedahl died after saving his ship from an attacking warplane.",
        "content": "DETROIT LAKES — There’s a lot of history in churches around the area, and people should make sure they know what they have before they throw it out. Those wise words came from Darlene Olson, “sometimes known as a little lady with a little bit of spunk,” she said, who is chaplain of the American Legion Auxiliary in Detroit Lakes and active with Immanuel Lutheran Church in Audubon. She spoke at the Memorial Day program in Detroit Lakes on Tuesday. Olson found a banner while cleaning at the church that honors two local men who died in World War II. “I’m extremely interested in history and our veterans,” she said. “Maybe when you are cleaning your church you may find something wrapped up in a closet,” she said. “It may be a treasure like I found.” On the white banner with wide red borders are 20 blue stars and two gold stars, in the shape of a cross. ADVERTISEMENT “Many people don’t know about the banner and the meaning of the gold stars, “Olson said. “I know that because I’ve asked a lot of people over the last few weeks. The banner with a blue star represents a soldier in the armed services.” The concept goes back to 1917, when a man who was missing his two sons who had gone off to war decided to put up a banner with blue stars on it to honor them. Since then, displaying a blue star service banner shows a family’s pride in their service man or woman, she said. “The blue star is changed to gold if the family member lost their soldier during service time,” she said. She was captivated by the gold stars on the banner, and wanted to find out more about the service members they honored. “I looked at the cemetery map and I talked to the sextant at our church,” she said. “There they were: Private Delbert Kohler HQ company, 194th tank battalion. On April 9, 1942 he was captured (by the Japanese) and took part in the Bataan (Death) March – they were given no food or water on the march to the prison camp,” she said. Kohler survived the march, but could not survive the extremely inhumane conditions once they arrived at the camp. He died of disease at Camp O’Donnell at 26 years old. He is buried in the Philippines, but she said he “has a gravesite in our cemetery next to his parents (but he has no memorial) stone – the church wants to get a stone put up at his home grave. “We are working on this right now,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Bataan Project website: Camp O’Donnell was an unfinished Filipino military base that the Japanese put into use as a prisoner of war camp on April 1, 1942. The camp was a hellhole, with most men sleeping under buildings or on the ground. “There was no netting to protect the men from malaria-carrying mosquitos as they slept, so many men soon became ill with malaria,” according to the Bataan Project. “The Archbishop of Manila sent a truckload of medical supplies to the camp, the Japanese commandant refused to allow the truck into the camp. When the Philippine Red Cross sent medical supplies to the camp, the Japanese took 95% of the supplies for their own use. When a second truck was sent to the camp by the Red Cross, it was turned away,” according to the Bataan Project. “The POWs in the camp hospital lay on the floor elbow to elbow and only one medic — out of the six medics assigned to care for 50 sick POWs — was healthy enough to care for them. When a representative of the Philippine Red Cross stated they could supply a 150-bed hospital for the camp, he was slapped in the face by a Japanese lieutenant.” Private First Class Delbert J. Kohler was considered too ill to be transferred and remained in the camp hospital. According to records kept at Camp O’Donnell, PFC Delbert J. Kohler died on Tuesday, June 2, 1942, from dysentery and was the 1,145th POW to die in the camp and was buried there. The Japanese military didn’t release information about Kohler, so it is not known when his parents learned of his death. But after the war, they requested that he be buried at the new American Military Cemetery in Manila. He was reburied in Plot L, Row 11, Grave 58, according to the Bataan Project website. The second gold star on Olson’s banner is for Russell Haukedahl, gunner’s mate third class in the Navy during World War II. In April of 1945, “the ship was under attack by Japanese warplanes,” Olson said. “Russell was able to gun this plane down. He saved his fellow sailors and he saved his ship.” But his helmet flew off and he was seriously wounded by metal fragments. “He became unconscious,” Olson said. “A medic ship came to pick up the injured sailors. Ironically, on that ship was Cameron, Russell’s brother. Russell died that night and was buried at sea, with his brother there watching.” ADVERTISEMENT His graveside is at Immanuel Cemetery in Audubon, along with his family. He does have a military stone in his honor. “What can we do to support our veterans? We can fly our flag, especially on patriotic days like today,” Olson said. “We can write our elected officials on behalf of our veterans. We can show our support for our veterans in a VA hospital or nursing home by sending care cards or care packages, and make them visits. We can wear our poppies on Memorial Day to support our military. We can show our respect to our VFW and our American Legion. One of their mottos is ‘they will not be forgotten.’’’ Others who spoke at the Memorial Day program Monday in the Pavilion included Detroit Lakes VFW Commander Jason Bristlin, who gave opening and closing remarks, and VFW Chaplain Gary Rehborg, who handled the invocation and the benediction, and gave a heartfelt, patriotic talk on freedom and liberty as expressed throughout the song that he said nearly became the national anthem, \"My Country ‘Tis of Thee.\" Sarah Hoffert read the stirring poem, “The Little Blue Forget Me Not,” and the Lake Region Veterans Color Guard posted and retired the colors, and gave a three-shot rifle salute outside while \"Taps\" was played. Prior to the program a Memorial Day parade was held down Washington Avenue.",

These are three new cases booked against him for allegedly perpetrating violence on polling day. A single judge granted him interim protection from arrest (till June 5) with six conditions in the case of destruction of an EVM at a polling station in the constituency. The judge had ordered that the Chief Electoral Officer should have Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy under complete surveillance during this period, and that he should be allowed to visit the counting centre only on the day of counting of votes, i.e. June 4. He is facing criminal charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Representation of People Act, 1951, including attempt to murder.

        "content": "failed to pay an in memoriam tribute to former soap star Johnny Wactor on Monday - but fans were left fuming for another reason. Monday's rerun episode did not end with an emotional tribute to the late actor who was murdered on Saturday. But fans were not angry about that as they continued to share thoughts and their own tributes of Johnny. Instead, they were upset about the General Hospital official X's tweet commemorating Memorial Day. The tweet read, \"Happy Memorial Day, from all of us at #GeneralHospital!\" with an American Flag emoji at the end. Fans did not like the use of the word happy in the phrase. One fan wrote: \"Do better. It is not 'Happy Memorial Day'. What you are saying is 'happy remembering those that died in service to their country day'. It's not about bbqs and getting drunk today,\" A second fan said: \"Memorial Day is not happy. It’s for honoring the deceased men and women who gave all for our freedom. Fix this please.\" Another agreed: \"It not appropriate to say 'Happy Memorial Day'. The day is set aside to honor those who died serving the country. There is nothing \"happy\" about Memorializing the millions who have died in war.\" While the show hasn't had a TV tribute yet, they did take to their social media accounts express their sorrow over the 37-year-old's death. \"The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor’s untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time,\" The social media post said. Under the Instagram post with their tribute, many actors from the show commented. The actress who played Sasha (Sofia Mattsson) who played the wife of Johnny's character Brando took to the post. \"We will miss you so much, Johnny. One of the most incredible humans I've ever met,\" Sofia wrote, adding a red heart emoji at the end.",

        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

Jean Carroll, and he may be in for a third one after his Memorial Day attack on the woman who he was found to have sexually assaulted. Trump on Monday posted a lengthy attack labeled as a Memorial Day post. \"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn't count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for 'DEFAMATION,'\" he wrote, referring to Carroll's cases.

And that remains true today -- all options are on the table,\" Haberman reported on Monday. A commenter replied to Haberman, saying, \"Maggie- we have lost a lot of faith in you as a journalist. I am a very honest person and what we learned from the Trump trial was disheartening to say the least! It may take a very long time to build back trust. I can’t speak for all, but many feel this way. I won’t lie to anyone and if I error in some way, I own it. Completely own it and correct it.\" This prompted pushback from conservative lawyer George Conway and Trump biographer David Cay Johnston. \"I’m sorry, but this is just complete nonsense, and reflects a lack of understanding about journalism. A vast amount of the negative information we know about Trump, his administration, and his minions, comes from Maggie’s reporting,\" Conway said. \"I sat through the part of [Michael] Cohen’s cross-examination that mentioned her, and there was nothing untoward about her handling of him or anyone else.\" Johnston added: \"You clearly don't understand the role of journalists. Maggie has done extraordinary work in getting Donald to say things. That's her job.

CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link.

        "content": "London Councillor suggests Christian Heritage Month being singled out by pausing city hall’s proclamation policy London City Hall, as seen on June 1, 2023. (Daryl Newcombe/CTV News London) Share Official proclamations issued by the City of London are back in the spotlight. On Monday, the Corporate Services Committee paused its review of three proclamation applications so that the policy can be reviewed once again. “There’s some inconsistencies in the way that we apply proclamations, as well as what we’re proclaiming, and I do think that it should be reviewed by staff just to make sure there’s alignment,” Councillor Corrine Rahman told colleagues. Rahman’s motion referred three requests for proclamations on the agenda to a future meeting of CSC while city staff review the proclamation issuance policy, including clarifying whether requests for proclamation can be made by individuals or must come from organizations. The three applications on the agenda were: Shine the Light on Woman Abuse (November) Christian Heritage Month (December) Childhood Cancer Awareness Month (September) “It feels as though it’s Christian Heritage Month that’s being pulled aside because it’s the one that has a persons name (on the application),” suggested Councillor Susan Stevenson. “I’m not sure why it’s being seen as though it’s an attack on, or pulling out one particular proclamation?” replied Rahman. Stevenson asked that all three proclamations be approved before the policy is reviewed by staff. “The referral was for all three proclamations,” Rahman said. “And it’s again tying the motion to a referral to review all proclamations.” “I do think that we need to put a bit of a pause on our proclamation approvals, and and review the policy before we continue to issue them,” added Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis. “We give proclamations to anybody and everybody under the sun,” responded Councillor Paul Van Meerbergen before being informed that council has denied some proclamation requests in the past. There would be sufficient time for staff and council to review the policy before the dates of the three observances. The committee recommended the referral 3-2 (Stevenson, Van Meerbergen opposed). After refusing to make proclamations for more than 20 years, council adopted a new proclamation policy in early 2020 to acknowledge Black History Month. Since then, council wades through a variety of applications each month for official recognition of certain days, weeks, or months. Applications are received by the Clerk's Office, but it's up to council to decide which are approved. “This is taking a considerable amount of staff time,” Rahman explains. “We also have to see what’s the value added of having proclamations when they do take up staff time.” She adds that the city established an Anti-Racism and Anti-Oppression team since the proclamation policy was created, “And yet there is very little involvement from that team on how we look at proclamations.” “Is the request truly for an observance of an event a month or week for honouring, remembering and celebrating— or is it something else?“ Rahman concludes. “Sometimes those do come in, and so we have to be able to look at it from that lens.” Council will consider the referral and policy review at its meeting June 4.

There’s no definitive of what the risks would be but as someone who is 57, there’s clearly going to be a risk in terms of that age profile of potentially having more of an impact for someone who’s older.\" Trending The Tyson vs Paul boxing match is set for July 20 at AT&T Stadium and is anticipated to occur in front of a nearly or completely sold-out crowd. The venue, with a seating capacity of over 80,000, can be expanded to accommodate up to 100,000 fans, reflecting the high demand and excitement surrounding the event. The MVP Promotions frontman has openly acknowledged that his upcoming bout against Tyson will be the defining moment of his life. Paul participated in face-to-face encounters with Tyson during press conferences held in Texas and New York City to promote the event. These encounters allowed Paul to fully grasp the magnitude of the occasion as he prepared to step into the ring with the legendary boxer.

        "content": "Jannik Sinner has put the rumors to rest by confirming his relationship with fellow tennis player Anna Kalinskaya. The world No. 2, recently seen with Kalinskaya, had fans buzzing about a potential new power couple in the sport. Sinner candidly responded to an inquiry about their romance after his French Open victory, stating: \"I don't like to talk about my private life much, but yes, Anna and I are dating,\" in Italian. This confirmation follows fan speculation fueled by Sinner receiving a call from 'Anna' while taking a photo with a fan in Monaco. Both Sinner and the Australian Open champ were also observed dining out together and training at the same tennis club in Italy last month. Kalinskaya was present on Court Suzanne-Lenglen during Sinner's French Open match against Christopher Eubanks, although she had her own competition to focus on as she faced Clara Burel. Rafael Nadal provides retirement update after emotional French Open exit Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms Sinner and Kalinskaya join the ranks of tennis's elite couples, including Katie Boulter and Alex De Minaur, Elina Svitolina and Gael Monfils, and Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa. Tsitsipas and the former world No. 2 began dating a year ago but split after the Madrid Open. Despite being seen together post-breakup, they both confirmed a reunion later on. \"He already said everything. It's pretty clear. The relationship is working very well now. He already explained. I have nothing else to say,\" noted Badosa last week. \"I mean, it's already our private life. I think one of the things that I didn't like or we didn't like is that it was very public, so now we want to keep things a little bit more on our own.\" \"I still understand that it's not going to be easy because we are two public people, public person, and people will ask, but we want to keep it more for ourselves because it's never easy to combine our careers to that. Let's just try to keep it simple for both of us, because I think it helps and it's healthier.\"",

        "content": "At the rate the Blue Jays have been going, nothing is ever guaranteed — even when playing the host Chicago White Sox at Guaranteed Rate Field. Then again, any game against the worst team in the bigs should be viewed as a guaranteed win. In White Sox starter Nick Nastrini, the Jays were facing the same right-hander who they lit up at home last week when Toronto won its first series in a month. In Chris Bassitt, who was drafted and played for the South Siders, the Jays had a veteran on the mound coming off a solid start (he went seven scoreless innings against the White Sox last Wednesday.) The Jays needed a win after a miserable weekend in the Motor City. A 5-1 victory over the White Sox on Memorial Day wasn’t worthy of popping champagne bottles, but it was refreshing nonetheless for a beleaguered ball club. It all lined up against Nastrini, who gave up a home run to Bo Bichette last week when the Jays brought back a revised look of the home run jacket during their 9-2 win. Bichette took Nastrini deep again Monday in the fourth inning as the Jays took a 3-0 lead on two hits, each going yard. Isiah Kiner-Falefa produced the Jays’ third hit on a two-out line drive into left field that went for a double as he extended his hit streak to six, a stretch that has seen IKF record 10 hits, including five for extra bases. Bassitt worked his way through a couple of jams to give his team five shutout innings. He looked to be in pain for someone who was nursing neck issues last week when he opposed Nastrini at Rogers Centre. Still, Bassitt struck out seven without issuing a free pass. Keep in mind the White Sox are the 30th-ranked offence in a 30-team league. Once Bassitt’s day ended, the Jays received solid pitching from Nate Pearson, who hasn’t been solid. The big righty gave the Jays two scoreless innings. Then came Erik Swanson, who looked to have turned a corner until he surrendered a leadoff homer in the eighth inning. A very long out deep into centrefield to the next hitter didn’t inspire much confidence. A single forced another pitching change as Zach Pop was summoned from the bullpen. Suddenly, Chicago had the tying runner at the plate. And then the game turned interesting when Pop gave up a two-out single as two runners were on base. Pop induced a fly ball to right field to end the inning. The Jays were able to exhale when Davis Schneider turned on a pitch with two outs in the ninth inning for a two-run homer as much-required add-on runs were produced. Genesis Cabrera began the ninth by putting the first two hitters on base. A double play eased any potential anxiety followed by a game-ending groundout. The Jays at least give themselves a shot of a sweep, which would be a first for a team that hasn’t been swept or produced a sweep. For what it’s worth, the Jays remain the lone team in the bigs to experience neither. It marked a first for George Springer when his name appeared in the starting lineup in the No. 7 hole, a career-leadoff hitter whose struggles at the plate have forced the Jays to move the veteran down in the order. He wasn’t in the lineup Sunday at Comerica Park where the Jays lost a 14-11 heartbreaker to the Detroit Tigers on a three-run walk-off homer in the ninth. One day later, Springer turned on the first pitch he saw in his first at-bat in the second inning and deposited into the sparse seats deep in left field. With two outs, Daulton Varsho, who went deep in Detroit during a five-run eighth inning to give Toronto an 11-9 edge, drew a walk before Springer’s belt. Springer’s long ball was his fourth of the season and first since April 24, a 22-game homerless span. In the opening series against the host Tampa Bay Rays, Springer went deep on back-to-back days to begin the season. In Springer’s second at-bat against Nastrini, once again he swung on the first pitch. This time he popped out in foul territory. Bichette’s blast was his fourth home run of the season. An inning later, a fielding error provided the White Sox with their second scoring opportunity against Bassitt. For Bichette, it was his fourth error of the season. He committed two in the second game of the season on April 29 against the Rays. Bichette didn’t make his second gaffe until May 5. Speaking of the number four, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. produced a four-hit game Sunday. On Monday with the Jays having runners at the corner in the sixth, Vlad Jr. hit into an inning-ending double play. Through eight innings, the Jays had four hits, including three from the bottom of the order. The fifth hit came in the ninth inning on a Springer leadoff single. In total, six were recorded, but half went yard. Springer’s multi-hit game was his first since April 24. Toronto’s restless fanbase, whose patience with the overpaid and underachieving club is increasingly growing thinner by the day, might want to take a look at the woeful White Sox and the plight of the South Siders. Chicago entered its series opener against the Blue Jays having lost five in a row, the most recent on Sunday in a 4-1 loss to the Orioles on a day when Garrett Crochet, who was lights out last week at Rogers Centre in a win, pitched well. What stood out from the loss to Baltimore involved White Sox manager Pedro Grifol and his post-game availability when he pulled no punch after he held a closed-door meeting. He described his team’s effort as “f—ing flat” and suggested the team had disrespected the game. “I don’t have much. Crochet pitched his (tail) off ... Most of the guys were (effing) flat. Unacceptable. That’s all I got. Flat. Period. Major League game. Gotta respect it. Pretty simple.” As bad as the Blue Jays have played, whether it’s a listless lineup, a porous pen, a poor outing by a starter, nothing compares to what the Pale Hose have endured and figure to endure in their march to recording the worst season in club history. The Jays arrived in Chi-town a season-low six games under .500. “For the fanbase and for everyone who is not here, as cliche as it sounds, there’s a reason we play this many games,’’ said Jays manager John Schneider during his pre-game availability. “You can say that it’s May or you can say that our season’s over. “The guys aren’t doing that. I’m not doing that.” fzicarelli@postmedia.com",

        "content": "The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) has expressed deep concern regarding the notable lack of transparency and accountability in the recent announcement by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Heineken Lokpobiri and current government’s drive for the oil and gas sector revamp. According to the Minister, a certain $16.6 billion has been invested in the oil and gas sector over the past year. HEDA in a statement signed by its Chairman, Olanrewaju Suraju called for immediate and thorough disclosure of the details surrounding this claimed investments that is unknown to the country or the host communities. HEDA emphasizes the necessity for the Minister to provide a comprehensive report on the investments for the necessary engagement of relevant stakeholders, stating that the report should include a detailed breakdown of the substantial $5 billion and $10 billion prospects towards deepwater offshore assets. According to Suraju , “We demand a full disclosure of the $1.6 billion purported investment in oil and gas asset acquisition in the face of devastating pollution and legacy of liabilities in the oil producing and impacting communities.” This call for clarity underscores HEDA’s commitment to ensuring that every dollar is considered against environmental, economic and social costs for the country and its people. He stated that HEDA is seeking detailed information regarding the recently publicized $20 billion deal with investors, aimed at significantly boosting oil and gas production in Nigeria. “The organization is not just interested in the broad figures but also in the social, environmental, and economic implications of the deals, including the timeline for its implementation and the expected outcomes. “Such transparency is crucial for public trust and for ensuring that the benefits of these investments are felt by the Nigerian populace. “HEDA Resource Centre reaffirms its commitment to promoting transparency and accountability in the oil sector and calls on relevant stakeholders to ensure openness and transparency in the sector.” According to him, this statement reflects HEDA’s ongoing dedication to advocating for responsible governance and its belief that transparency is fundamental to the effective management of Nigeria’s oil and gas resources. The organization continues to push for rigorous scrutiny and public disclosure to ensure that the sector operates in the best interest of all Nigerians.",

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 5:07 p.m. on Monday for strong thunderstorms until 6 p.m. for Warren County. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph and pea-sized hail (0.25 inches) are expected. \"At 5:04 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm 20 miles southeast of Erie or 7 miles west of Elgin, moving east at 30 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is possible.\" Expect strong thunderstorms in the following locations: Columbus around 5:20 p.m. Spring Creek around 5:30 p.m. Lottsville around 5:35 p.m. Other locations impacted by this storm include Bear Lake, Starbrick, and Sugar Grove. The weather service adds, \"Persons in campgrounds should consider seeking sturdy shelter until this storm passes.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall: Beware of rapid water flow: Avoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes. Visibility matters: Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "description": "Located in northeast of country, colourful city is in the spotlight.",
        "content": "It’s deep, it’s dark, it’s eerie, it’s fun. It’s 100 metres down the shaft at the Sauberg Mine in Ehrenfriedersdorf, Germany. We’ve arrived at this incredible subterranean Ore Mountains destination on the same cable-car elevator that tin miners used to take to work. But, since the mine was abandoned in 1990 and eventually reopened as an attraction, it’s tourists who now descend to the depths in this specialized cage elevator operated by a motor attached to a massive, noisy spool of burly, braided metal cable. In the mine shaft, tourists can wander around in the murk, ride a small tram and even have a play at drilling for tin ore. It’s a unique way to give tourists a thrill and teach them about the Chemnitz region’s colourful mining history and culture. After all, mining, even if it’s now defunct, is part of Chemnitz’s culture and Chemnitz has earned the European Union’s esteemed European Capital of Culture title for 2025. Chemnitz — with a population of 250,000 — was also the host city for this year’s Germany Travel Mart, a huge conference for the country to promote itself to media and tour operators. As well, it was an opportunity for Chemnitz to show off what it has and what it has planned for its reign as European Capital of Culture. Besides plunging 100 metres toward the Earth’s core, that also means 1,000 events and 120 projects throughout the year from castle visits, reflecting on its East Germany history, myriad sculpture installations, concerts, art exhibitions and festivals (including a chocolate one, yum), car races, wine, sports, opera, ballet, high-tech and small business. “It’s an invitation for everyone to come here and leave some of their money,” Veronika Hiebl from the Chemnitz 2025 Committee said with a laugh. “Our motto is: C the Unseen, and up to now Chemnitz is the unseen, waiting to be discovered.” The European Capital of Culture title can go two ways — to a famous destination like Amsterdam, Athens or Glasgow, or to a lesser-known city that wants to put itself on the map like Graz in Austria, or Mons in Belgium. When the region was part of East Germany from post-Second World War 1948 to German reunification in 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell, the socialist party changed Chemnitz’s name to Karl-Marx-Stadt to honour the Communist philosopher and economist. Karl Marx never actually visited Chemnitz, but a 40-ton bronze bust sculpture of him 7.1 metres high on a 4.5-metre platform remains the city’s most famous landmark. Germany is littered with castles — 25,000 across the nation and hundreds of them in Saxony surrounding Chemnitz. In German, the word for castle is “schloss.” So, we went schloss hunting with Chemnitz-Zwickau-Region marketing manager Benjamin Schreiter, who did double duty as guide on the Valley of Castles tour. We hit up three castles — the former residence of the Schonburg-Waldenburg princes, Schloss Waldenburg; a former summer home of the Prince of Saxony, Schloss Rochlitz; and the former seat of the Count of Schonburg, Schloss Rochburg. Rather than being the setting for the shenanigans of aristocracy, the castles today are regal tourist attractions where you can dine and drink Riesling at on-site restaurants, see a concert, host a conference or get married. “Castles are not relics of the past, but vibrant hubs of cultural activity,” said Schreiter. “So, this area has been well-positioned for centuries as a cultural capital and being the European Capital of Culture next year helps put a label on it.” Chemnitz is located in northeastern Germany, a one-hour train ride from the nearest airport in Leipzig or a five-hour train from the international hub of Frankfurt. Lufthansa, Air Canada and Condor fly between the German cities of Frankfurt and Munich and the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. Check out .",

        "description": "Pumpkin was about to be put down when his saviour, Vet Dr Sharon Williams, drove five hours so rescue him",
        "content": "A dog who was seconds away from being put to sleep was saved at the eleventh hour after a vet checked her phone. The pocket bully, named Pumpkin, was heartlessly abandoned by his owner and tied to the gates of a council-run dog pound. He was about to be put to sleep after vets suspected he had cancer. But luckily for him, Vet Dr Sharon Williams decided to drive five hours to rescue him. Under the care of the kennels, Pumpkin was unexplainably and rapidly losing weight he'd come in at 30 kilos and dropped to just 15 within a few months, reports the ECHO. READ MORE Puppy found tied up and abandoned in secluded wooded area 'where nobody would find her' Vet Dr Sharon Williams, the founder of Celandine Wood Animal Rescue (CWAR), said the kennel staff 'suspected he had cancer' and due to the cost of care he was due to be euthanized. Sharon had in the past agreed to save another dog who was due to be put to sleep, from the same kennels. She got a message from staff to ask if she could also take in Pumpkin. She said: \"I phoned the woman and said yes, we can take Pumpkin. But she said, 'oh, you're too late'. They've just sedated him and they're now putting him to sleep. \"I'd been out cleaning my yard when I was text about saving Pumpkin. My heart sank, knowing that if I'd have just seen the text a few minutes before he would still be alive.\" Thankfully he has found his forever home (Image: Sharon Williams) But then Sharon's phone rang again, and the vet told her \"we can't find a vein\" and asked \"can you still take him?\" Sharon and a CWAR volunteer Paul jumped into her car and drove five hours to pick Pumpkin up. Sharon said: \"He had a little pumpkin-coloured jumper on him, which is where we got the name from, because he was actually called George. Although he was totally emaciated and looked tired, sad and ill, he wagged his tail when he saw us. You could just tell he just wanted to be loved.\" Under the care of Sharon, Pumpkin had blood tests and a specialist ultrasound scan done which ruled out cancer. Suspecting he may have food allergies, she put him on a specialist hypoallergenic diet and he soon began putting on weight. Within weeks of the special diet, he was like a different dog. Sharon added: \"He was thriving and full of life.\" Pumpkin has now been adopted by new owners who fell in love with him. Pumpkin was seconds away from being put to sleep (Image: Sharon Williams) Sharon said: \"One of our dog walkers took a shine to him, and she wanted to foster him, then she decided to keep him. His new owners take him for long hikes in the countryside, which he loves. He even has a wife, Ginny the miniature dachshund. He just loves people and is always happy when snuggled next to someone on the sofa.\" Sadly, CWAR is facing closure unless it raises £500,000 to set up new premises. They must vacate their shelter by June 14 because the landowner is selling up. The rescue centre, based in Wirral, currently has 50 dogs in its care and also takes in cats and wildlife from across the region. CWAR was founded after owner, Sharon began taking animals home with her which had been brought in to be euthanised for no good reason. She plans to build a facility that will quadruple the amount of rescue spaces so they can save many more animals. She said: \"Pumpkin was one of the lucky ones. But the reality is that the UK rescue system is at breaking point. I get around 10 requests a day to save desperate animals in need and we have to say no because we are full. The majority of rescues up and down the country are full to bursting. That leaves so many animals with nowhere to go.\" \"Celandine is run entirely by volunteers, who juggle rescue work with their jobs and family commitments. We are all so heartbroken when we have to say no and we're all passionate about growing the rescue. We want to be able to say yes to every animal we're asked to save.\" Sharon is appealing for people's help to grow the rescue. She said: \"We fundraise, but then with tests, medications and food, often one dog can cost thousands, and it wipes our funds out. We really need people who care about animals to help us so we can help them.\" To donate to CWAR, visit the GoFundMe here.",

The former lover has vowed to fight on after losing a long and bitter child support battle in court — insisting “This isn’t over yet”. The former Celtic player and manager has won his fight against claims he owed £43,222 in child maintenance to his ex.

It comes after a hearing earlier this month in which her lawyer said the Northern Irish Hoops hero, who pays £1,500 a month for the child, should have been paying more than what was agreed in 2011. We told in 2022 how he was served with a legal document stating he owed £43,222, which he disputed and took civil action against Ms Jonsen.

In 2008, after a test, his name was added as the father. His lawyer Marie Clark had claimed her client had been “prejudiced” by wrangling over the payments, 13 years after an agreement was reached. She said: “The charge is defective because it’s about a raise in the aliment.

        "description": "The NBA Hall of Famer lived a long, illustrious life in sports and activism, but his true love was a jam band from San Francisco",
        "content": "The summer of 2015 was a culminating moment in Bill Walton’s life. He’d been seeing the Grateful Dead , in all its iterations, for 48 years by that point. He’d been to hundreds upon hundreds of shows, but like so many Deadheads, the series of 50th anniversary shows in Northern California and Chicago (billed as Fare Thee Well) were going to be monumental: The first time most of the group’s surviving members would play together in years, and the last time it would happen. Walton, who by then was already known as one of the world’s most famous — and, with his six-foot-eleven stature, recognizable — Dead fans on the planet, spent the summer serving as an unofficial liaison for the group: giving interviews about the reunion and writing an afterword to a coffee table commemorating the shows. Walton, who suffered from chronic pain ever since he began suffering injuries as a teenager, was ready for the grueling run of marathon shows. His spine felt good, he had a new knee, he was ready. Walton stood amidst the massive crowd for the shows, which he described, in earnest hyperbole, as the “nine days that changed the world.” “Everybody was so happy and there was just the tears of joy and pride and gratitude,” Walton later told Relix of the experience of seeing the shows up close. “I got to be in the pit, 12 people deep, right in front of Bruce Hornsby. I was there , and I will never forget, and I feel terribly sorry for the person behind me.” Bill Walton, who died earlier today at age 71 of cancer, was known to most as a Hall of Fame NBA center, and, later, an illustrious and energetic broadcaster and color commentator on national television. But just as important to Walton was his lifelong love affair with the Grateful Dead. Walton became a familiar, unmistakable presence at Dead shows, blissed out in the pit alongside the band’s uttermost diehards. It didn’t take long for the band itself to notice the towering giant who began showing up to all of the band’s West Coast shows. The first time Dead singer-bassist Bob Weir noticed Walton out in the crowd, “I was thinking to myself, ‘There’s a truly tall individual.'” “He was the only one in the audience,” said the band’s drummer Mickey Hart. “I thought everybody else was sitting down, and of course they were standing up, and he was standing up too.” Editor’s picks Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History Such was Walton’s devotion to the band, that he attended upwards of 850 Dead shows in his lifetime, showed up to announce nationally-televised basketball games in tie dye, went viral for sorting through recyclables at Dead shows, showed up on stage at Dead & Company New Years Eve shows as “Father Time” (a nod to the character Bill Graham used to dress up as each New Years Eve), DJ’ed on the band’s Sirius XM satellite radio channel, and eventually, in 2021, was inducted into the band’s very own “Hall of Honor,” which he later described as the single most important distinction he’d ever received. But despite the attention and platform he received as one of the group’s most famous and recognizable true believers, Walton considered himself just another member of the Dead’s ever-expanding community of devotees. “I’m really just a fan,” he said in 2022. Throughout his career, and especially when promoting his 2016 memoir (titled, what else: Back from the Dead) , Walton frequently drew comparisons between his favorite band and the sport to which he devoted his life. “Playing in a band and playing on a basketball team, I’m sure, are very, very similar,” he once said . “It requires, first of all, tremendous discipline.” The Dead, he later claimed , helped make him the basketball player that he once was, and the person that he became. As a lifelong competitive athlete, there was a unique reward in being a fan of the Grateful Dead, Walton explained , because “they play all the time, and they win all the time.” Related From Trucker Hats to Joggers, Target's Grateful Dead Drop Has You Covered From 'Dead' to Toe Dead & Company Venture Out to Space — And Their Past — at Dazzling Sphere Opener Lost Robert Hunter Manuscript Chronicling Birth of the Grateful Dead to Be Released Walton’s love for the band was far more than a useful sports analogy. For him, his Dead fandom served as a guiding light and constant beacon of stability, community and inspiration in a life plagued by pain and setbacks. “For me, the Grateful Dead, there are so many different reasons why I love it so much, but they give me strength, they give me confidence, they give me hope, and they make me believe that tomorrow is like, going to be even better,” he said in 2016. “And at the end of the day, when they run off the stage and get out of there, I’m out in that pit just saying, ‘ Yeahhh , I’m with those guys.’” When Walton cleared his calendar for the nine Fare Thee Well shows in California and Chicago in 2015, he had merely one quibble with the shows: the fact that they marked an ending. “I am going to be there,” he said in the weeks leading up to them. “I am going to be cheering for more.” Trending The Boos Have It.

I just want to listen, I want to be educated, I want to be inspired, I want to be healed. I want to think, I want to laugh, I want to cry, I want to dance....Years ago, I used to plug them [with requests] all the time. Then I stopped asking and I tried to listen more.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans have been left fuming after the first of this year's finalists were announced. Viewers had been treated to eight auditions on Monday evening during the first live semi-final show of the week. But some were unhappy with the result. The rules see one act sail through to the live final on the public vote, while another is given a pass to the final by the judges. On Monday night, 'musician' Sven Smith, dog performers The Trickstars, child street dancer Trey Braine and slapstick act Bikoon! all took to the stage. They were joined by Ukrainian roller-skaters Duo Stardust, opera singer Innocent Masuku, singer Taryn Charles and the Ssaulabi Taekwondo Troupe. Innocent Masuku, Trickstars and Ssaulabi all made it to the top three after the vote was opened to the public. South African hopeful Innocent Masukuk was crowned the winner of the night based on the votes received, while the judges unanimously put through Ssaulabi to Sunday night's final. Dog act Trickstars were sent home. But not all viewers were impressed with the outcome, as they had wanted London-born singer and music teacher Taryn to get through. Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter , one raged: \"Erm Taryn was robbed!\" Another added: \"I'm shocked Taryn didn't make top 3.\" And a third blasted: \"What? Those bloody dogs over Taryn?\" There was also outrage that child star Trey Braine didn't get a place in Sunday night's live final either. \"Cannot believe Trey Braine has gone home, he was absolutely fantastic wanted him 2 win the show,\" another fan complained. Britain's Got Talent's live semi-finals are taking place at 8pm every night on ITV this weekend. The show will break for Saturday night, before returning with a bang for the big live final on Sunday evening. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight .",

        "description": "The 58-year-old actress - who has Rowan, 21, and Grier, 18, with husband Chris Henchy - confessed she might not be \"as generous\" as her character Lana is in her new Netflix rom-com 'Mother of the Bride', if her children walk down the aisle, and she is already struggling now that they have flown the nest",
        "content": "She told HELLO! magazine: \"I did identify with [Lana] as someone who is not prepared at all for both my daughters having left the nest. \"But we are also different at the same time. I don't know if I could be as generous a mother in the way Lana is if it was my daughter getting married. I do hope I handle my daughter getting married as well as Lana does when it eventually happens.\" The 'Blue Lagoon' star insists mothers struggling with \"empty-nest syndrome\", don't have to, because they can do anything they want to in life, regardless of their age. She said: \"I still love to act and make movies and I also have my own multimedia platform, Beginning Is Now. I really do feel in my prime creatively and I'm excited about now and the future. \"I feel as though a lot of women my age have that empty-nest thing, where they don't know what to do, but it doesn't have to be like that. You can do what you want and be who you want to be.\" Brooke recently admitted she will always worry about her girls. She told People: \"You get on vacation and all you do is think about where they are and what they're doing. It's like there's really no relief. \"It's like people say, 'Oh, it's going to be great. Just when they start to be able to walk. You don't have to carry them everywhere. Then they're walking all over and you're worried about them falling off the stairs and in the pool and down the street, and then they're able to walk.\"",

WINNIPEG – Scott Arniel believes overcoming the lowest point in his career will help him reach higher aspirations with the Winnipeg Jets. Arniel was named the new head coach of the Jets on Friday, 12 years after his only other time in the role ended with hem being fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. “One of the darkest times for me in coaching — probably in hockey — was when I got fired in Columbus,” Arniel said at a media availability at Canada Life Centre on Monday. “I had never been through it. It took a long time to get over it. “Whether it was anger or it was doubt. Whatever it was, it took a while. You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

WINNIPEG – Scott Arniel believes overcoming the lowest point in his career will help him reach higher aspirations with the Winnipeg Jets. Arniel was named the new head coach of the Jets on Friday, 12 years after his only other time in the role ended with hem being fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. “One of the darkest times for me in coaching — probably in hockey — was when I got fired in Columbus,” Arniel said at a media availability at Canada Life Centre on Monday. “I had never been through it. It took a long time to get over it. “Whether it was anger or it was doubt. Whatever it was, it took a while. You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

        "description": "The International Shark Attack File identified Volusia County as the world's hotspot for sharks preying on humans with 351 unprovoked attacks identified since the earliest records they could find, which date back to 1837.",
        "content": "Florida is the shark bite capital of the world according to a report from the state’s Museum of Natural History and Florida University — with the area around Daytona Beach having the highest concentration of attacks anywhere. The International Shark Attack File identified Volusia County as the world’s hotspot for sharks preying on humans with 351 unprovoked attacks identified since the earliest records they could find, which date back to 1837. Florida, which has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, has seen a whopping 928 attacks in that time frame, followed by Hawaii with 195, then California with 138 and South Carolina with 118. New York has only reported 24 unprovoked shark attacks in that time. The shark attack file found data for 1,640 total attacks in the US going back almost 200 years, which leads the table in terms of the country which has suffered the most attacks. The US is followed by Australia with 706 then South Africa which has seen 262 attacks, from all types of sharks combined. In 2023, the Shark Attack File documented 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide. Of those attacks, 36 of them happened in US waters. Florida had 16 cases representing 44% of the US total and 23% of unprovoked bites worldwide — and half of those were in Volusia County. Most of the attacks happened during the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day when more people are in the water. On Labor Day 2023, two swimmers were bitten by sharks in separate incidents near Ponce Inlet, just south of Daytona Beach. A man was bitten on his left hand, while a different shark bit a woman’s right foot. Neither attack was life-threatening. Lifeguards in Volusia County say they see sharks all the time but its very rare they attack. “Locals that live here interact with sharks on a daily basis and never have any issues,” Volusia Beach Safety Deputy Chief Tammy Malphurs told WKMG-TV. “The bites here are a case of mistaken identity.” “We’ve never had any life-threatening injuries,” Malphurs continued, “but we do have a lot of bites, mainly in the New Smyrna Beach area.” Last year’s shark attacks include the attack on Tatyana Koltunuk, of Queens , who was swimming last summer at Rockaway Beach when a shark took a chunk out of her thigh — the first attack there in 70 years. In addition to the 69 unprovoked attacks, there were another 22 bites that are classified as provoked, meaning humans initiated the contact with the shark. Other cases involved boats, aquariums, or post-mortem bites. According to the National Ocean Service , sharks’ scary reputation isn’t based in reality. Out of 300 species of sharks, only a dozen of them have ever attacked humans and they generally don’t like our taste, preferring to feast on other marine mammals. If you’re attacked by a shark, experts urge you to defend yourself as playing dead won’t work. People are encouraged to fight back, concentrating on attacking the eyes, nose and gills of the shark. Experts recommend if you have anything at your disposal such as a surfboard or fishing equipment, utilize those items to immobilize the shark. But most of all, don’t overthink the danger. “Sharks have only been known to attack humans when they are confused or curious,” the National Ocean Service says. “If a shark sees a human splashing in the water, it may try to investigate, leading to an accidental attack.”",

        "content": "The Education Above All Foundation (EAA), with the support of its strategic partner Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD), has successfully supported the graduation of 120 outstanding students out of 316 scholarship recipients at the American University of Beirut (AUB) through its Qatar Scholarships Programme. The diverse cohort of graduates, spanning various majors, specialties and backgrounds, was honoured in a ceremony attended by members of the AUB community, graduates, and their families. Of the 316 recipients of the EAA Qatar Scholarship Programme, 73 % are Lebanese, while the rest are Syrians and Palestinians, a press release by the EAA said. \"Over the span of four years and through a contribution of $4.2mn, Education Above All Foundation's Al Fakhoora Programme has provided invaluable opportunities for Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian students to pursue their academic journey at AUB,” said EAA Al Fakhoora Programme director Talal al-Hathal. “We are proud of the achievements they have attained today as their graduation signifies the importance of equipping oneself with the skills, critical thinking, and adaptability needed to navigate the complexities of life with a sense of purpose,\" he said. \"The Qatar Fund for Development strives to achieve its vision of promoting sustainable development and social justice through education,” said QFFD acting director-general Sultan al-Aseeri. “We believe that education is the foundation for building strong and resilient communities, and it is the best way to empower individuals to achieve their full potential and create opportunities while fueling sustainable growth.\" Qatar Scholarship Programme director Professor Joseph Costantine introduced in his speech the second edition of the Ace Talks competition, which is open to the students of the programme at AUB who would like to compete in public speaking, writing, presenting, and creative thinking. He emphasised the scholarship's goal of pushing students to think creatively, acquire new skills, and embark on remarkable journeys. Costantine also shed light on the programme’s significant accomplishments, including the launch of a new study abroad programme in collaboration with the EAA and Qatar Foundation. He said that the educational journey of the vast majority of adolescents and youth is hampered by economic instability, a refugee crisis, and others. Addressing these challenges, he continued, requires a comprehensive approach that involves tackling economic issues, investing in education infrastructure, and ensuring equitable access to education for all students, regardless of their background or geographic location. – QNA Related Story Qatar University, QDB organise 2024 'Al-Fikra' National Entrepreneurship Competition QU department celebrates success of Smart Start Campaign in primary schools",

AXTI between March 24, 2021 and April 3, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important July 5, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. SO WHAT: If you purchased AXT securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 5, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Loading... Loading... DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AXT, Inc. overstated its property holdings; (2) AXT, Inc. did not disclose that the attempted listing of an AXT, Inc. subsidiary in China had reportedly failed; (3) AXT, Inc. routinely engaged in environmental violations and unsafe business practices; (4) AXT's production declined in 2023; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

By Abdulyassar Abdulhamid Dr Yusuf Tanko, the former spokesperson of Peter Obi Presidential campaign in the 2023 elections, has said that former Anambra governor has been meeting with political gladiators in the country, including the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. Tanko stated this during an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today. He said that Nigerians needed a merger in 2027 that would take them out of the woods. Tanko said, “Obi has been meeting with owners of industries, technocrats, students and political gladiators. Adamawa Govt declares 3-day mourning for ex-EFCC boss Lamorde, lawmaker Okada riders invade Lagos Police Station, engage officers in ‘gun battle’ “There are quiet a number of them that have been reached out to, for example Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso who is a good political gladiator. We had met with him. “We had meetings with different individuals and political parties like SDP and ADC. Most of the political parties will be reached out to. They are already having meetings among themselves. “You need to have a conglomerate of grounded political parties who are interested in getting Nigeria out of the wood.” I don’t see Atiku, Obi alliance However, a former federal lawmaker, Tajjuddeen Yusuf, says he does not see the possibilty of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar merging with Obi in 2027. He said, “They worked together in 2019. It would not be out of place if they work together again. However, I don’t see their minds, but I don’t see the possibility. “They met few days ago. After the meeting, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came out to say that he would continue to contest as long as he is alive and healthy. “To me, that was to send the signal to especially the people who may have the notion that he would step down for Obi. A statement a week later clarified that. I believe both Atiku and Obi will contest.” LEARN AFFILIATE MARKETING: Learn How to Make Money with Expertnaire Affiliate Marketing Using the Simple 3-Step Method Explained to earn $500-$1000 Per Month.

        "content": "Ferrari won its second Grand Prix of the 2024 season in Monaco and it was a special one for Charles Leclerc, with it being his home race. There were delirious celebrations at the Italian outfit’s garage as Fred Vasseur was ecstatic alongside the Monegasque driver. Now, in the broader scheme of things, the Ferrari team boss has also claimed that this season’s championship is still wide open for the taking. The Frenchman cited how there are three teams now in the fight for poles and race wins every weekend – Ferrari, Red Bull, and McLaren. While he admitted that the competitive advantage might swing in either team’s favor at different tracks, they are within striking distance of having a chance for the 2024 title. Even Red Bull admits that they are under pressure and not at their dominant best like in 2023. The Austrian team struggled at the Miami and Monaco GP races, with their RB20 facing major handling issues in the Principality. Meanwhile, McLaren and Ferrari have polished their challengers with significant upgrades in Miami and Imola respectively. At the Monaco GP, both teams locked out the front two rows and finished the race accordingly to take a massive chunk of points in the constructors. While Monaco is a peculiar track, Vasseur knows that they have the pace and potential to keep Red Bull in check for the rest of the season. The past three races have given enough evidence of why the Ferrari boss is openly claiming a championship fight in 2024. Can Fred Vasseur’s prophecy carry on at the Canadian GP? After three consecutive races where Red Bull have not looked at ease , it won’t be an easy recovery for the defending champions going into the next round in Canada. However, with the Montreal track being a unique one, nothing can be said about Ferrari and McLaren’s competitiveness, too. Max Verstappen has stated that their car has a fundamental design issue of having handling issues on tracks with excessive bumps and kerbs, essentially street circuits. Monaco was the classic example of the same with the Austrian team experiencing similar issues last year in Singapore. While Red Bull performed rather well at the 2023 Canadian GP, it is pertinent to note that they had a decent performance advantage at that point of the season. 12 months later, with Ferrari and McLaren being relatively closer on ultimate pace, this year’s Canadian GP could be a wide-open battle. There are unique elements to the track in Montreal with long straights and fast chicanes that may tilt the performance balance in either team’s favor. Thus, on a circuit with overtaking opportunities galore, another race where Red Bull comes second best is not outside the realms of possibility.",

        "content": "Oftentimes in recent years, the eccentric Bill Walton, a lover of nature and the Grateful Dead, could be seen on a Pac-12 broadcast in a tie-dye shirt, finding new ways to make broadcast partner Dave Pasch laugh. The UCLA legend, two-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer, who died Monday at 71 after a battle with cancer, was an accomplished broadcaster for CBS and NBC before joining ESPN and ABC in 2002 as an NBA game analyst. Some of his most memorable moments as a broadcaster, though, came when he shifted to college hoops broadcasts in 2012, and a supercut of amusing soundbites was posted to social media Monday after Walton’s death. The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg It features Pasch telling Walton to take a bit out of a cupcake while the candle in it was still lit — and Walton proceeding to do just that. One time the two were joined by Jay Bilas, who was wearing a tie-dye shirt that Walton praised, saying he has one. “This is your shirt,” Bilas replied. Walton once brought dirt from Temecula and rubbed it on his arms and face, saying afterward, “Now I’m ready to go.” During one Oregon game, Walton was enjoying National Popcorn Day by pouring some on Pasch’s head and putting some in the Ducks mascot’s mouth. “Please, party on,” Walton said. “It’s a wonderful day, it’s Oregon, the sun was out.” In the middle of an Oregon-Arizona game in 2020, Walton was holding a large stone and said to Pasch, “I was just carrying it around. I was wondering if you’ve ever been stoned before,” and handed the stone over. Bill Walton asks Dave Pasch \"Have you ever been stoned?\" and \"Where are your stones?\" amongst other things pic.twitter.com/Q85ZBneqC7 Other memorable moments included him briefly going shirtless to change shirts, playing a Glockenspiel, and saying he “found that mushrooms only help you.” He once called a White Sox-Angels came with Jason Benetti and said, “I’m not a very good catcher. I’m much better at getting high than getting low.” And one time with a Hawaiian lei around his neck, Walton said, “It doesn’t get any better than this.

Ecuador’s only representative at the Olympics in the road cycling race and individual time trial will be Jhonatan Narváez, the national cycling federation said in a statement on Monday. Carapaz said on his social media he wished “the best of luck to Jhonatan,” and added he will keep reaching for new goals. The two cyclists had a tough battle for Ecuador’s spot in Paris. Carapaz was the first Ecuadorian to win a grand tour, the 2019 Giro d’Italia. He also made the podium at the Tour de France and Spanish Vuelta, but hasn’t finished any grand tour since 2022. This year, he won a stage and finished seventh in the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland in April. The Olympic champion claimed in various interviews that the process to earn Ecuador’s only road cycling spot in Paris favored Narváez. The federation rejected the accusation. Carapaz urged the country’s sports ministry to intervene in the decision but that hasn’t happened so far. Narváez, winner of the road cycling race in the Pan American Games in Santiago last year, has yet to comment on the decision.

While they are few and far between, luckily, we still do get decent discounts from time to time. Such is the case with Sabrent's recently released Rocket 5 PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD, as its 1TB variant has dropped to the lowest-ever price of just $171 (buying link below). Sabrent Rocket 5 4TBPCIe 5.0-based NVMe SSDs are very fast, and the Sabrent Rocket 5 is no exception. Sabrent claims the 1TB Rocket 5 is capable of delivering 13,000 MB/s of sequential reads and 9,500 MB/s of sequential write speeds. In terms of random throughput, Sabrent says read IOPS (input-output per second) can hit 1300K while write IOPS can hit 1400K. Image via AnandTechAs you can see in the spec table above, the 2TB and 4TB drives are even faster when it comes to writes, so if you want even better write performance, you can opt for those higher-capacity variants. However, irrespective of what you get, make sure you grab a heatsink, as PCIe Gen5 SSDs are known to run dangerously hot as they are very fast.

        "content": "PREPARATION In this photo taken on May 24, fishermen in Masinloc, Zambales, are making the most of the remaining days before the onset of the rainy season, which may come in the next few days, according to Pagasa. —Joanna Rose Aglibot SAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines — Aside from the continuing presence of Chinese coast guard vessels in their traditional fishing grounds in the West Philippine Sea, small-scale fishermen in this province are also bracing for the impact of the northeast monsoon on their source of livelihood and other economic activities. Also known in coastal communities as “sigwada,” the northeast monsoon forces fishermen from various municipalities in the province to suspend their operations due to large waves and strong winds. This phenomenon occurs from the last week of May to August. READ: Zambales fishers lament China Coast Guard’s bullying in Scarborough According to fishermen, it would be unsafe to venture into the sea because of the danger of strong waves and wind. “This meant more than three months of famine among the fishermen and other poor people along the coast,” Joey Marabe, provincial coordinator of fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, told the Inquirer in an interview on Monday. He noted that in recent years, fishermen have been left without a livelihood and received little support from the government during the rainy season. A small fishing boat with two to four fishermen spends at least P500 for gas and other expenses every fishing trip within the municipal waters and could earn from P1,000 to P1,500, depending on the market price of their freshly caught fish. “While no one wants to suffer from the effects of sigwada, it is criminal negligence for the government to do nothing during this period of calamity,” Marabe said. He said that despite the disaster and emergency funds available to the relevant government agencies, the most vulnerable sectors, such as the fishermen, were not receiving sufficient support. Ronnel Arambulo, Pamalakaya vice chair, said a P1-billion fund from the Department of Agriculture’s quick-response fund is available annually to mitigate the effects of disasters on the agrifisheries sector. He said they have already started to coordinate with coastal communities across the country to monitor the potential impacts of sigwada and ultimately mobilize the fisherfolk to seek sufficient economic support and other forms of aid from the government. “We are starting to conduct consultations with the fishing communities with the aim of insisting on the economic and livelihood support they deserve not only in the province of Zambales but also in different parts of the country where the disaster of the monsoon is expected,” said Arambulo in a separate interview.

Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. said the provincial government has short- and long-term programs in place to address the needs of local fishermen and has set the stage for sustainable fishing by putting up millions of pesos in funds for fisherfolk to go into “payao” fishing, a system that uses fish aggregating devices in open sea.",

        "content": "Inquirer photo/Noy Morcoso MANILA, Philippines — A woman selling her 8-day-old baby and a government employee who served as her broker have been charged in court for qualified trafficking and child exploitation. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Monday that the baby’s mother, 29-year-old Ma. Chariza Dizon, and her broker, Arjay Malabanan, have been charged in the Manila Regional Trial Court. The pair may face life imprisonment if found guilty for qualified trafficking under the 2003 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act No. 9208) as amended by RA 10364. READ: 2 arrested as police foil baby’s sale on FB In a resolution dated May 17, Deputy State Prosecutor Olivia Laroza-Torevillas and Assistant State Prosecutor Claire Pagayanan of the DOJ’s task force against human trafficking recommended no bail for the trafficking charge. But on the child exploitation charge, they recommended a bail of P80,000. The DOJ prosecutors said the evidence given by the Philippine National Police’s Women and Children Protection Center was “uncontroverted” and “sufficiently established” the crime of qualified trafficking of the newborn. Dizon and Malabanan were arrested in a police entrapment operation on May 15 in Dasmariñas City, Cavite. According to the DOJ, the PNP acted on the request of the National Authority for Child Care in February to investigate the “proliferation” of illegal adoption and child trafficking through Facebook. A police operative pretended to want to adopt a child and wrote on her Facebook account: “I’m hoping for a blessing ... baby,” which drew several offers. The operative reportedly received a message on Feb. 29 from an account named Kuy’s Jay, who later turned out to be Malabanan, offering to sell a newborn for P90,000, excluding his commission. On May 13, Malabanan reportedly made several follow-up calls to the operative, including a video call where he showed his ID as a computer operator for the Dasmariñas City local government. On May 15, the police operative and a companion who pretended to be the spouse met Malabanan and Dizon who brought her baby, at a church in Dasmariñas City, where the two were arrested.

        "content": "History has seen leaders whose thinking have been influenced by geography—who after gaining power usually felt the need for their territorially deficient or confined countries to expand as an expression of national power and prestige. Today, this is the case of Chinese President Xi Jinping who thinks of his country as being boxed in and which therefore feels the need to expand geographically toward the sea. However, when one goes back to most of China’s history, the focus of its economic and political activities has been geographically inward with the end in view of enhancing economic productivity and instituting peace and harmony. Thus, when one looks at China’s vast topography, the land is sloping down to the east, with the lowland area being well-watered by the large Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The tilling of China’s fertile lands has been an important influence in its landward focus of socioeconomic development efforts. Its conflicts with its inland neighbors who live in porous borders have also contributed to the development of this inward focus in its efforts at building a militarily and economically strong state. Thus, we see the territorial expansion even of the powerful Han, Tang, and Yuan dynasties as being focused only within the confines of the continent.After the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the subsequent regimes of Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao were also characterized by inwardly focused administrations. But when Xi assumed China’s leadership, he strengthened mass surveillance, advocated for “wolf warrior diplomacy” and changed “China’s passivity” into an assertive strategy to defend China’s dubious claims over border and marine territories. The two major reasons why Beijing might undertake military action particularly against Taiwan are promoting China’s territorial and national identity aspirations and, more importantly, Xi’s own personal ambitions and sense of legacy. However, going back again to China’s geography, Xi must be made to realize the blunt geographic truth for China that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would occur directly off the shore of its most economically and militarily important and populated coastal provinces. A war would have an immediate impact on the three provinces nearest to Taiwan, namely, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, which together account for 22 percent of China’s GDP and 17 percent of its population. And China has no geographic “defense-in-depth” endowment, i.e., no easily traversed space to which it can retreat. Moreover, the damage will not be limited to coastal provinces but will still spread to interior ones which are part of an intricate network of domestic supply chains. Ballistic missiles may even find their way to the Three Gorges Dam—the world’s largest capacity hydroelectric power station which if destroyed could cause widespread inundation of China’s great plains. Thus, while China’s heartland suffers from the curse of proximity to enemy lines, its adversaries—particularly the United States—enjoy the blessing of “defense-in-depth” through the existence of what are called the three Pacific island chains. These island chains include the fortified areas of the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, Mariana Islands that include Guam, Caroline Islands, Australia, and Hawaiian Islands, among others. The geomilitary capacities of these island chains provide strategic multiple encirclement by US and allied forces. Indeed, any invasion, especially on Taiwan, could entail major economic, financial, diplomatic, and reputational costs for China. Simply put, even if China gains Taiwan, it will have sacrificed its larger ambition of becoming a global superpower. This is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory! Aside from the need for the international community to advise Xi against his risky territorial ambitions, there is also a need for policymaking circles in Beijing to persuade him to abandon his costly plans and to just focus on enhancing China’s already robust economy. And they can remind him to just observe this sound advice of Deng Xiaoping: “Hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead.” Meliton B.

        "content": "Photo from the Alliance of Concerned Teachers MANILA, Philippines — The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) has said it plans to make full use of the recent Supreme Court decision declaring Red-tagging as a threat to one’s life by citing it in a complaint it will file with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). ACT Chair Vladimer Quetua said the group was still gathering information about last month’s distribution by the military and Department of Education (DepEd) personnel of leaflets referring to students who belong to youth groups as terrorists during a seminar at Taytay Senior High School in Rizal province. READ: Supreme Court: Red-tagging threatens one’s right to life, security For ACT Teachers party list Rep. France Castro, the incident was a “clear case of harassment and intimidation” and a “blatant disregard” of the recent Supreme Court ruling. She said the leaflets were distributed by the Philippine Army’s 80th Infantry Battalion and DepEd Rizal. Using comic strips, it showed how students could avoid “recruiters of the CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army)” who may be spotted in rallies “teaching us to be angry at the government.” “After that Supreme Court decision, we anticipated that the government would finally, finally end this kind of practice, but they are still doing it and it’s just disappointing,” Quetua added. He said they would soon file a complaint with the CHR, adding that they would also check if the distribution of such leaflets was also happening elsewhere. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac), however, denied the group’s accusation, saying “a careful perusal and review of the said pamphlets [would] easily prove that there [was] no ‘Red tagging’ in the said materials.” It added that it did not target any organization, adding that “it merely informed the students of the modus operandi of recruiters of the New People’s Army, which is factual and based on evidence.” According to NTF-Elcac, the 80th Infantry Battalion held the seminar as part of a civic education program to raise awareness on national security threats and promote patriotism among the youth, in line with a memorandum of agreement between it and DepEd. “[These] seminars provided factual information that allows the youth to make informed decisions affecting their lives. The seminars were conducted transparently with the consent and cooperation of the Division of Rizal and attendance was voluntary. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Much has been written in the Philippines about the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, where more than a thousand Filipinos were displayed, put on exhibit, and made to perform rituals, including one which was faked—slaughtering and eating dogs—and probably one of the most remembered by Americans who went to the exposition, stereotyping Filipinos as dog-eaters. The exposition opened on April 30 so we just had its 120th anniversary, one which is being commemorated by the Missouri History Museum, which recognizes that the exposition was both “grand and shameful.” But first, a point of clarification about the name. Many people, including myself, call it the 1904 St. Louis Exposition but that name was used for a fair that was held almost every year for several decades in the 19th century and meant more as an agricultural county fair. The 1904, although held in St. Louis, Missouri, took a different direction. It was actually meant to be the United States’ first world fair, a grand affair to commemorate the Louisiana Purchase a century earlier that greatly expanded the US territory. The event in 1904 was meant not just to commemorate the Louisiana purchase but also to proclaim American might, and what better way to do this than to include an exhibit of Filipinos, natives of its new territory across the Pacific. The exhibit was meant to project the US’ belief in Manifest Destiny, expressed by US Sen. Alfred Jeremiah Beveridge, in a speech delivered at the fair: “We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of the world ... He has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world.” William Taft, the Philippine governor general, praised the fair for helping in the US’ pacification of the Philippine Islands, for opening new markets for American goods, and opening access to the archipelago’s natural resources. It’s not surprising there was more than a display of Filipinos. The human exhibits moved and performed. A schoolhouse was built with real classes daily, to show how America was educating the natives. There were three categories of Filipinos with “Visayans,” all dressed up singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the morning to represent the fruits of America’s civilizing mission. This was not the first time Filipinos, or people of color, were put on exhibit by the colonial powers. During the Spanish colonial period, Filipinos were put on display in international fairs in London (1851), Paris (1855, 1867), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), Amsterdam (1883), Madrid (1887), Chicago (1893). After the St. Louis fair, some of the Filipinos were practically kidnapped by entrepreneurs and moved to other places in the US, still for display. Jose Rizal and other Filipino members of the Propaganda Movement in Spain were furious about Madrid, writing in La Solidaridad, “Let the Philippines not forget that her sons have been treated like this, to be exhibited and ridiculed.” In 2023, The Washington Post ran a series of exposés about the Smithsonian Museum’s “racial brain collections” put up by Ales Hrdlička, sometimes called “the father of physical anthropology.” Hrdlička was a racist and collected brains to use for his pseudoscientific research trying to prove racial differences in the brains. Among the brains were at least four obtained from Filipinos who had been part of the 1904 exposition. One young woman, given the name “Maura,” had died of pneumonia on her way to St. Louis. Her skull was found but not her brain. All of these “research” activities were done without the permission of the Filipinos and their families. We need to include this exhibition in our social science and history textbooks, including its broader context of racism and imperialism. The racism included the maltreatment of African-American visitors to the exposition, who received such shabby treatment that the National Association of Colored Women declared a boycott of the exposition. The discussions in our schools should be broadened to discuss the other human zoos where Filipinos were displayed, together with other people from the colonies of other Western countries. We have to remember, too, that the young country that was the US also preached Social Darwinism, an imaginary world where whites were believed to be at the pinnacle of evolution. This is why the exposition in St. Louis included exhibits of impressive technologies still new even to the American public, including a wireless telephone, an improved x-ray machine, personal automobiles ... and incubators for infants born premature. The incubators were disastrous, using live infants put on display inside the incubators for the public to watch. Of the 43 babies used for the exhibits, 39 died. The fair had many other exhibits to show the world what America had achieved in science and technology. —————– Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "The practice of “othering” or looking at those who hold social, economic, and overall cultural values that are quite different from ours is a result of social exclusion. This is usually done by the ruling majority population in a geographical area, leading to another oppressive practice of sidelining (or in popular Filipino slang, “pag-itsa puera”) of the voices of minority populations. Provinces in the country that are ruled by the majority of lowland-based Christian Filipinos are most likely to disregard the belief systems of minority groups, among them Mindanao Muslim migrants, and do not consider these in local development planning and decision-making. The opposite is also true for some local government units in the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao that are dominated by Bangsamoro Muslims. Some localities in the mainland areas are not only populated by Bangsamoro Muslims (Magindanawn, in the two Magindanao provinces; and Meranaw in Lanao del Sur province), but also by indigenous communities of Teduray, Teduray-Lambangian, Blaan, Manobo, and Higaonon, among others. In addition, a substantial number of residents or those born in several localities in the region, like Cotabato City, are considered legal constituents there. They are referred to as the “settler communities” of the autonomous region. Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro organic law (BOL), created the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), an integral offshoot of the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed in March 2014 during the administration of President Benigno Aquino III or P-Noy. It was the result of a long and tedious peace process spanning the terms of five Philippine presidents—Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and P-Noy. The BOL provides for the legal guarantees of basic rights of not only its majority Muslim (Bangsamoro) populations but also of the indigenous and settler communities in it. The BARMM government has created the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs and the Office for Settler Communities as part of the regional autonomous bureaucracy. However, in a few localities in Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, some indigenous communities of the Teduray and Teduray-Lambangian have expressed how the phenomenon of social exclusion reared its ugly head after the destructive Tropical Storm “Paeng” (international name: Nalgae). Several Teduray and Teduray-Lambangian houses were buried under huge rocks, mud, and floodwaters as a result of Paeng. Consequently, 27 people were killed (some Teduray regional leaders claim there were more)—they were buried alive when their houses collapsed in the onslaught of the eroding soil and boulders from nearby Mount Minandar. Their houses, built through a municipal relocation project of the municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat in Maguindanao del Norte, were located near the foot of Mount Minandar, which is just across the coastal barangay of Kusiong. It is called Sitio Tinabon, in reference to the concave nature of the area. According to a fact-finding report of one Teduray-Lambangian member of the current Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the Teduray community in the area initially opposed the relocation site in consideration of their traditional belief that the area in Sitio Tinabon was considered “sacred.” For them, the area was a transition site for the souls of the departed among them, before they are brought to their final destination through the sea that is just across the sacred site. But the local government leadership there considered this as just a superstitious belief; it ignored several appeals from the Teduray community there and decided to go ahead with the relocation project. As a generally peace-loving people, the indigenous Teduray community beneficiaries of the relocation site assented to the local government leadership decision. A few years after, Paeng struck, hitting the relocation houses first, among others, since these were right at the foot of the mountain whose soil had loosened as a result of long years of intensive logging (since the martial law years of the elder Marcos), and of mining it of gravel for local construction needs. Social exclusionary practices of local government units have exacerbated the effects of “natural” storms that happen frequently among the impoverished, marginalized, and sidelined indigenous communities in the region. There is a need to revert such practices toward more social inclusion—engaging indigenous communities at every step in the planning and decision-making processes, even during the conception stages of any development project, until its implementation. —————– Comments to [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Is this the worst Senate in Philippine history? One is tempted to agree. Just look at the “hearing” led by Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, which made a mockery out of the august chamber. The senator, who attained his status largely on the coattails of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s tenure, was a picture of embarrassing incompetence and performative antics. For some critics, the whole “PDEA leaks” hearings under Duterte’s former police chief—arbitrarily dragging in even actress Maricel Soriano—were nothing short of a clown show, which only exposed the troubling deterioration in the quality of membership in the country’s highest legislative office. Sure, the whole back-and-forth between former PDEA agent Jonathan Morales and Sen. Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada Jr. was entertaining. Arguably, the shadowy former drug enforcement agent pulled off one of the most memorable “UNO reverse card” moves, when he reminded everyone that it was Estrada, not him, who was actually convicted of a crime. The preposterous charade ultimately cost Sen. Juan “Migz” Zubiri his Senate presidency. Coupled with the “footgate” of Sen. Ramon “Bong” Revilla (another senator who remained in office despite facing serious criminal charges), this was the final straw. Zubiri was already facing backlash from his colleagues for lack of decisive leadership, which contributed to, inter alia, delays in the legislative process and the prolonged Quiboloy drama. Nevertheless, there are rays of hope. Over the past two weeks, Senators Risa Hontiveros and Sherwin Gatchalian provided us with a masterclass in legislative scrutiny. The curious case of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo has rightly raised alarm bells across the country and beyond since it has clear national security implications. The controversial mayor’s case came to the limelight after as many as 875 people were rounded up at the Bamban-based Chinese online casino, Zuan Yuan Technology Inc. amid accusations of kidnapping by a former alleged detainee. As if allegations of human trafficking and gangster-level crimes weren’t enough, the Philippine National Police has also revealed that they are examining whether the Chinese online casino was also involved in surveillance and hacking of government websites. In short, there is considerable evidence to suggest a toxic cocktail of criminal syndicates and espionage-influence operations at play. Things turned even more surreal when Guo, who allegedly owned the aforementioned Chinese online casino, failed to provide any proper documentation or narrative on her true origins. Efforts to “humanize” her story, thanks to a lengthy interview with a celebrated journalist, only backfired after her extremely lavish lifestyle was exposed—including the ownership of a helicopter and more than a dozen vehicles, all purchased in the final years of the pro-China Duterte administration. The intervention of Gatchalian was particularly crucial because it exposed the paucity of any accusation of “Sinophobia” by pro-Beijing proxies. As a patriotic Chinoy, Gatchalian is not only deeply knowledgeable about the lives of the Chinese-Filipino community but also in a position of moral authority to expose the perilous national security implications of not only Guo’s case but also the proliferation and persistent presence of Chinese online casinos. The newly crowned Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero was quick to share his own two cents by seemingly ignoring all the national security concerns in favor of placing the burden of proof on his fellow senators and government agencies. While I do agree with him that due process is a kernel of our legal system, I find the genealogy of his intervention quite curious: What did the good senator say about the brazen violation of human rights, our constitutional, and thousands of extrajudicial killings during the Duterte administration, again? But did we really need such sensational Senate hearings to expose Guo’s stupendously suspicious case? In any robust democracy or self-respecting nation, her case would have been dealt with de rigueur by authorities without much fanfare. And what happens when news fatigue sets in, and the nation moves to the next controversy? Ours is not yet a mature democracy since we are, to use the terminology by philosopher Guy Debord, a society of the spectacle (“La société du spectacle”). Instead of instituting the foundations of rule of law, and proactively guarding our national security, we simply move from one “separate pseudo-world” and fragmented yet sensational representation to another at the risk of turning into a banana republic. —————– [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Every year, Menstrual Hygiene Day is a reminder of the critical need to address one of the most pervasive, yet least discussed aspects of girls’ health and empowerment: menstrual health and hygiene. For too long, the topic of menstruation has been shrouded in stigma and misconceptions, leaving girls feeling ashamed and uninformed about their bodies. In 2016, we published a study and found that girls learn about menstruation through a patchwork of myths and misconceptions from family and friends. Teachers often feel ill-equipped to discuss menstrual health, and the topic is frequently omitted or glossed over in school instruction. This lack of reliable information leaves girls unprepared and vulnerable to the physical and emotional challenges of menstruation. The lack of awareness among boys and men about menstruation often perpetuates teasing and stigma, creating an environment where girls feel unsupported and embarrassed. Education plays a pivotal role in ending this cycle. Understanding menstruation is essential for girls to grasp their body changes, maintain overall well-being, and empower them with knowledge about fertility and reproductive health. Educating adolescent girls about menstruation ensures they can manage their periods confidently, enabling them to make informed choices about their bodies and fostering a healthy transition into womanhood. Unicef is dedicated to empowering girls with the knowledge and confidence they need to manage their menstrual health with dignity and pride. We are supporting the #MeronAko campaign, an initiative led by the Department of Education (DepEd) in collaboration with the Center for Health Solutions and Innovations to reduce the stigma around menstruation through a series of workshops and colorful, adolescent-friendly materials. Last year, we introduced Oky, a period tracker application designed and created for and with girls in the Philippines. Oky more than tracks menstrual cycles, it delivers accessible, reliable, and engaging information about menstruation and other critical topics for young people, including relationships, mental health, family planning, and child protection. Through fun and creative content, Oky helps demystify menstruation and empowers girls to take control of their health and bodies. As of May 2024, Oky has reached 74,000 girls aged 10-19. Support from the DepEd, the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education in BARMM, the Department of Health, the National Youth Commission (NYC), and the Commission on Population facilitated roll-outs and integration into services. We want to help every girl in the Philippines access this application. Providing adolescent-friendly tools is a foundational step toward creating a world where girls and boys can talk about menstruation without shame. I remember girls proudly waving copies of the information booklet on menstruation that Unicef produced, saying that they now have the knowledge that they should have learned prior to their menarche. A couple of boys soon joined us and expressed that the booklets have enabled them to engage in healthy conversation with girls on menstruation and learned that it is normal and need not be a trigger for teasing and bullying. Normalizing menstruation and ensuring effective menstrual hygiene management entails that boys understand menstruation and its physiological, psychological, relational, and socioeconomic dimensions. It is critical for fathers like me to be part of, even facilitate, the conversation on menstrual health and hygiene with their children, girls, and boys. Menstruation signifies the beginning of the reproductive journey of girls. In effect, so, too, for boys. Without the involvement of fathers in promoting proper information and practice on menstrual health and hygiene, menstruation will not fully shed the stigma and shame for girls. On the other hand, men and boys’ proper knowledge can create the optimal environment for effective menstrual health and hygiene management. Through initiatives like these, we have seen significant advancement in policies and plans, with approximately 60 percent of schools now equipped with menstrual health information, education, and communication materials for both teachers and learners as of 2021. There has also been a substantial increase in the provision of emergency sanitary pads and information on proper disposal, with 82.5 percent of schools reporting such provisions in 2021. In the Philippines, Unicef is calling for more data and evidence on menstrual health to understand the realities of adolescent girls, increasing engagement of the government and the private sector, making manufacturers accountable for plastic materials recovery in sanitary pads, promoting alternative, affordable, and environmentally sustainable menstrual materials, and building the capacity of teachers for creative and interactive approaches to learning delivery on menstrual hygiene. —————– Jon Michael Villasenor is a water, sanitation, and hygiene officer in Unicef Philippines.

        "content": "It has been a recurring theme in my articles over the years how our government and the bureaucrats who run it at all levels seem to have turned obstructionism into an art. And while one feels this wherever government front-line services are involved, it’s in the process of starting an enterprise where this seeming obstructionist mindset probably inflicts the worst harm. True, laws have been passed to make it easier to start, operate, and sustain a business. Yet little seems to have changed in how things work in actual practice. The Barangay Micro Business Enterprises Law of 2002 (Republic Act No. 9178) provided incentives and credit facilities to encourage small businesses. The Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 (RA 9485) mandated greater transparency and imposed maximum processing times for government transactions. Congress later saw the need to amend it in 2018 with the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act (RA 11032). But it has become clear that while rules can be legislated, good governance can’t. For all their good intentions, these laws appear to have had little effect on realities on the front lines. Stories still abound on the travails of small entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs who find the hurdles that government bureaucrats throw in their way so intimidating and exasperating, that many just choose to give up and forget it. The active online chat group of the Management Association of the Philippines has lately seen members share stories on their dealings with government. Someone told of his city government’s requirement for his firm to install a multimillion-peso sewage treatment system, supposedly based on a Department of Environment and Natural Resources regulation. “We decided to bite the bullet and had a system installed ... One year after installing, it still isn’t running because of delays in issuing permits from City Hall! Note that this same City Hall requires my staff to annually attend a food safety seminar and pass physical exams, even if we are an IT company. Talk about ease of doing business!” Another member shared their difficulties with a small nursery-kindergarten school started 44 years ago by his mother, and taken over by his wife when the mother passed away. “She had been okay for more than 13 years until the pandemic forced us to close the school ... After we re-opened in (a neighboring city) in 2022, the red tape it takes to formally close the school in (the old location) and open in the new location is still ongoing! Despite the stellar performance of the school with a 99.9 percent acceptance rate of its students to big schools that have accredited it, DepEd still insists on ‘protocol’ ... Very sad not only for entrepreneurs but educators as well!” Another member chimed in: “It took my friend and me three months to register a nongovernment organization for her, and a social enterprise for me ... Now that our documents have been finally approved, I don’t know if I still have any energy left to start operating, because we still have to go to other offices to complete the approval process, including opening a corporate bank account. I approached a bank that promotes itself as the best digital bank, but it asks for a list of 15 documents to submit! I have not returned to it. We will still have to go to the local government unit, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, etc. My friend and I now have first-hand experience on why we can’t attract more investors ... Why do we self-flagellate?” she asked. A veteran banker responded with what he described as “the tyranny of business registration.” He noted that of those who want to register a business, 95 percent probably have good intentions, while some 5 percent don’t.“ To prevent the 5 percent from registering, government makes it hell for everyone to register, including the 95 percent. And yet the 5 percent are still likely to be able to register because they know all the shortcuts, while many of the 95 percent will get fed up and give up. When finally the ‘registered’ bad guys mess up big time, government asks ‘how did these guys even get registered?’—and its ‘solution’ is to add more registration requirements, making it even more difficult for the 95 percent. But the additional requirements do not keep the bad guys away. And each new mess by the 5 percent gives birth to an additional registration requirement for everyone. The bigger the mess, the more cruel the new requirement becomes for the 95 percent. The hapless entrepreneur, who only meant to invest in his country, provide employment to his fellowmen, create value for his customers, and contribute to his country’s GDP, is punished. In the meantime, his government goes on expensive roadshows to invite foreign investors to join the 95 percent.” And that could well sum up how we keep punishing ourselves needlessly, year after year. —————– [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Reyes MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has again protested China’s annual imposition of a fishing moratorium in the South China Sea, including areas within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). This was the Philippines’ 25th diplomatic protest against China this year and the 158th during the Marcos administration, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). In a statement on Monday, the DFA said that China’s unilateral fishing ban within the Philippines’ EEZ violated the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). China’s fishing ban also “raises tension” in the West Philippine Sea and South China Sea, which contravenes the understanding between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate the maritime dispute, the DFA said. “The Philippines [calls] on China to cease and desist from the conduct of illegal actions that violates the Philippines’ sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its maritime zones,” it added. China imposed the fishing ban in the South China Sea from May 1 to Sept. 16. Earlier, it announced that its coast guard would start detaining for 60 days without trial foreigners who trespass into areas in the waterway supposedly under its jurisdiction beginning June 15. The Philippines has opposed China’s new policy, which the DFA had said would be “in direct violation of international law.” It instead urged Beijing to “comply with its obligations under international law,” particularly the 1982 Unclos and the final and binding 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA also asked China to “adhere to its commitments” under the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.” It cited Paragraph 716 of the 2016 arbitral award, which states that any Chinese fishing moratorium in the South China Sea that includes the Philippines’ EEZ is considered a breach of Article 56 of the Unclos “with respect to the Philippines’ sovereign rights over the living resources of its exclusive economic zone.” The arbitral award handed down by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration declared without legal basis China’s claims over most of the South China Sea, including the Philippines’ EEZ. “The unilateral imposition of the fishing moratorium raises tensions in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea, and directly contravenes the understanding between [Marcos] and Chinese President Xi Jinping to manage differences through diplomacy and dialogue and to de-escalate the situation at sea,” the DFA said.

        "content": "Two blockbuster Senate hearings have gone by; local and national politicians have jumped into the fray; the President has weighed in on the fiasco, and government bureaucrats have sprung into action—all to untangle the puzzle that is this small-town mayor. Yet, in the weeks since she grabbed headlines and became a household name, the mystery has only deepened: Who is Alice Guo? The true identity of the young mayor of the second-class municipality of Bamban in Tarlac province continues to confuse and confound, as Guo has given conflicting, perplexing, and nonsensical answers to simple questions about her background. At the May 22 inquiry of the Senate women, children, and family relations committee, the woman at the center of an investigation into an offshore gaming hub in her alleged hometown and her purported connections to China spent several riveting minutes digging herself into a hole, as her questioners poked hole after hole in her story. Soap-operatic tale Appearing to be on the brink of tears, Guo, who wore a luxurious ensemble and toted a Goyard handbag, spun a soap-operatic tale of her humble roots as a pig farmer, the unwanted love child of a Chinese national, Jian Zhong Guo, or Angelito Guo, and his Filipino housekeeper, Amelia Leal, who, she claimed, had gone missing since giving birth to her on July 12, 1986. Right off the bat, the committee chair, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, presented birth records that put the lie to the mayor’s claim, as the documents indicated that her parents were in fact married and bore two other children. Confronted with this, Guo resorted to her usual excuse: “As much as possible, I don’t want to tell you that ‘I do not know.’ But I really don’t know the answer.” As it turns out, the true answer may be that Guo’s Filipino mother was just a figment of her imagination. At the same hearing, Philippine Statistics Authority legal director Eliezer Ambatali told senators that there was no official record of Guo’s supposed birth mother. “For now ... the possibility is high that [Amelia Leal] doesn’t exist,” he said. An irate Sen. Loren Legarda scolded Guo: “If you’re really Chinese and fronting for other people, go back to your country. But if you are a Filipino and you were born here, convince us because we want to be convinced.” But after the five-hour hearing, an unrepentant Guo faced reporters and insisted: “I’m a Filipino. I’m not a spy.” Association with Pogos Even President Marcos is skeptical, however. He noted last week that no one among Tarlac’s political elite had heard of Guo prior to her victory in the 2022 elections: “I know all the politicians in Tarlac, and no one knows her. We’re wondering where she came from. How did this happen?” Since then, the solicitor general has launched an investigation into whether Guo should face disqualification via quo warranto petition, while the interior secretary has endorsed the mayor’s preventive suspension to the Ombudsman. Over the weekend, Senate President Francis Escudero, a stalwart of the Nationalist People’s Coalition, which claims Guo as its own, rightly said the burden of proving her guilt should fall on her accusers. But he would be blind not to see how that is an impossible task when an accused person counters facts with half-truths and lies. It’s obvious to anyone with an iota of common sense that Guo has gamed our system, whether in regard to her origins and citizenship or to her election and ties to Pogos or the Philippine offshore gaming operators. At the very least, Guo’s prevarications tell us she has something to hide. But her identity is secondary to a more crucial question: Who does Guo serve? If she is indeed Filipino, then she must explain the source of her apparent wealth, her father’s alleged links to China, and her association with Pogos. National security crisis And if she is Chinese, the government must uncover the people behind her—the Chinese government, money launderers, the triad, or a gaming syndicate? The authorities must find out how she won a mayoral election as a charlatan, and which officials, local and national, aided her in her charade. Were they fooled or let themselves be fooled by the lure of laundered cash? Appallingly, the Commission on Elections has washed its hands by blaming the public for not challenging Guo’s credentials and credibility at the outset. Never mind that it is vested with the power to investigate candidates on its own initiative. What about immigration officers who have permitted the entry of countless foreigners as tourists, only for them to wind up as students, Pogo workers or trafficking victims? Or the Department of Foreign Affairs literally being fast and loose in issuing visas? Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . All these point to the disturbing conclusion that the Philippines has a national security crisis on its hands, and the mysterious Guo is just the tip of the iceberg. The bigger enigma, however, is this: How many other public officers elected to serve the Filipino people are serving other masters in secret?",

        "content": "If there is one person in the country on whom 12 million senior citizens are greatly indebted, it is none other than Albay 2 nd District congressman Joey Sarte Salceda, chairman of the present House Committee on Ways and Means. Senior citizens are oftentimes shortchanged by unscrupulous businessmen including famous fast-food establishments who limit their discounts to P40 per purchase, P5 discount for cakes and one leading coffee chain’s “one food item and one beverage per visit” policy. Hotels, restaurants, thru their “promo rates” directly dishonor senior discounts and 12 percent Value added tax (VAT) exemptions and this includes even our airlines. Even in the purchase of maintenance medicines, seniors encounter differing policies on discounts and vat exemptions. Estimated VAT leakages for Senior citizens alone in 2022 was pegged at P14.77-B. And sadly, even government’s National Commission on Senior Citizens (NCSC) is greatly remiss on their mandate and has only registered 4 million out of our estimated 12 million seniors, thereby abandoning the remaining 8 million seniors, who are either unaccounted for or inexistent. But Rep. Joey Salceda together with Senior citizens Affairs chair Rep. Rodolfo Ordanes and PWD affairs committee chair Rep. Alfred Bascug conducted 60-day marathon joint panel hearings on these problems, met with affected sectors and agreed on significant aspects to resolve them. As a result, three bills were filed to clarify and enhance the benefits for both Seniors and PWDs, namely House bills 10312, 10313 and 10314. The first, HB 10312 will clarify discounts and exemption rules if the establishments have their own discounts and promos. (The rule is that restaurant promos should be authorized by the DTI, and if they are not registered, the 20 percent discount and vat exemption apply). The second, HB1031, will do away with the massive booklets handed out to seniors and eliminate fake cards by electronic alternatives such as enrolling them on the EGovPH Super App launched by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), This digital app streamlines access to government documents, permits, identifications and clearances, thereby enhancing the ease of doing business for the public. And the third , House Bill 10314 grants additional benefits for seniors and PWDs namely, 15 percent discount on electricity and water, 20 percent discount and VAT exemption on parking fees and skyways nationwide, Expanded basic necessities (groceries) discount for senior citizens from P260 a month to P500 a month, ease of access in online hailing and delivery platforms such as Grab, Angkas or Foodpanda or other deliveries. Rep. Salceda is the main architect of today’s immense health-related benefits enjoyed by senior citizens that were all included by him in the new tax reform landmark measures corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) and Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN). As a result , millions of senior citizens are enjoying cheaper VAT free maintenance medicines today . Today, there are more than 2,000 VAT-exempt drugs prescribed for cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol , TB, mental health and other ailments. This March, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) added 20 more medicines for hypertension, cancer and mental illness. Their much lowered drug prices make them affordable to many senior citizens and other poor citizens. In 2022, discounts on medicines of 2.3 million seniors amounted to P113.7-B. Salceda explains, “The core of the Senior citizen’s welfare issue is how to address increasing needs for specialized services and reduced personal incomes due to retirement”. This naturally produces a gap in personal capacity to finance not just health care but even basic necessities and the little pleasures that come with dignified old age”. “The average senior , he says, makes around P3,000 per month which makes 47 percent of them below the poverty line. Rep.Salceda is determined to establish a separate insurance fund to cover projected P1.6 Trillion in health care for all senior citizens.. This is expected to address today’s “acute and catastrophic health care” for sick senior citizens and especially their burdened ordinary families. Salceda reiterates, “ The fiscal resources for health are not yet exhausted”. “The absorptive capacity of the DOH to spend its budget in full, typically falls short”. “There’s usually around P40-B in excess funds that can be used to support an aggressive seniors health insurance system”. “We are on our way there”, he says. So being a senior citizen myself, I would like to thank Rep. Joey Salceda for protecting, standing up for the rights, not only for us the 12 million senior citizens, but also the 1.5 million PWDs and 15 million solo parents , who for the past have been disadvantaged and neglected. And in order to prod him on, here are two of my favorite political quotes. First: Take care of families, and you take care of neighborhoods. Take care of neighborhoods, and you take care of communities. Take care of communities, and you take care of a nation. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Port Moresby: More than 2,000 people are feared buried in a Papua New Guinea landslide that destroyed a remote highland village, the government said on Monday, as it pleaded for international help in the rescue effort. The once-bustling hillside community in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed early Friday morning, smothering scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them. \"The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,\" Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations obtained by AFP. The main highway to the large Porgera gold mine was \"completely blocked\", it told the UN resident coordinator's office in the capital Port Moresby. The landslip was continuing to \"shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike\", the letter said. The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. The centre also called on the UN to inform Papua New Guinea's development partners \"and other international friends\" of the crisis. The UN is scheduled to hold an online emergency meeting with foreign governments early Tuesday. They will try to coordinate a relief effort that has been complicated by the remoteness of the site -- which is situated in Papua New Guinea's rugged highlands -- as well as the severed road link and ongoing tribal fighting nearby. Locals and rescue teams have been using shovels and pieces of wood to find bodies under the landslide -- a mix of car-sized boulders, uprooted trees and churned-up earth that is thought to be up to eight metres (26 feet) deep. \"Nobody escaped. We don't know who died because records are buried,\" Jacob Sowai, a schoolteacher from a neighbouring village, told AFP. UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told AFP that the danger was ongoing: \"The landmass is still sliding, rocks are falling from the mountain.\" Streams of water were flowing between the soil and debris, while cracks were appearing in land adjacent to the landslip, he added. \"This might trigger a further sliding,\" the UN official warned, posing a \"serious risk\" both to rescuers and people living in the area. Australia said on Monday that it would provide emergency relief supplies, such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolences saying he was \"deeply sorry\" to learn of the disaster and offering assistance. US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and the World Health Organization have also offered support. The Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis, who is due to visit Papua New Guinea in September, \"was deeply saddened to learn of the devastation... and he assures everyone affected by the disaster of his spiritual closeness\". Britain's King Charles III offered \"heartfelt condolences\" in a message expressing \"great admiration for the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands\". Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The death toll has been climbing since the disaster struck as officials reassess the size of the population lying beneath mud and rubble spanning almost four football fields in length. Estimating the toll is difficult because many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years, said UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth. Five bodies and the leg of a sixth had been pulled from the debris by Saturday night. More than 1,000 people have been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. An outbreak of tribal fighting unrelated to the disaster was blocking attempts to bring in humanitarian aid from the provincial capital Wabag, the UN official Aktoprak said. \"Many houses are burning with others emitting smoke. Women and children have been displaced while all the youth and men in the area were carrying bush knives,\" he said, quoting from a report from an aid convoy attempting to reach the disaster site. The tribal battles had also delayed the delivery of heavy machinery and diggers. The area is located about 600 kilometres (370 miles) from Port Moresby. People from adjoining villages were helping to unearth bodies, said Nickson Pakea, president of the nearby Porgera Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"Because of the hard rock and the clay, the stone, and the rocks that came in, it is quite messy. It needs excavators to remove the debris,\" Pakea told AFP. A nearby mining joint venture, New Porgera Limited, had agreed to provide mechanical diggers to help the rescuers and clear roads, he said. Located on the side of densely forested Mount Mungalo, the village was home to a transient population that could swell to more than 4,000 people. It served as a trading post for miners who panned for gold in the highlands. Since the start of the year, the country has experienced multiple earthquakes, floods and landslides, stretching the resources of emergency services.",

        "content": "Ecuador's only representative at the Olympics in the road cycling race and individual time trial will be Jhonatan Narváez, the national cycling federation said in a statement on Monday. Carapaz said on his social media he wished “the best of luck to Jhonatan,” and added he will keep reaching for new goals. The two cyclists had a tough battle for Ecuador's spot in Paris. Carapaz was the first Ecuadorian to win a grand tour, the 2019 Giro d'Italia. He also made the podium at the Tour de France and Spanish Vuelta, but hasn't finished any grand tour since 2022. This year, he won a stage and finished seventh in the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland in April. The Olympic champion claimed in various interviews that the process to earn Ecuador's only road cycling spot in Paris favored Narváez. The federation rejected the accusation. Carapaz urged the country's sports ministry to intervene in the decision but that hasn't happened so far. Narváez, winner of the road cycling race in the Pan American Games in Santiago last year, has yet to comment on the decision. AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games",

Britain's Got Talent's biggest 'fix' rows Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight. She almost missed him, but was able to attach herself to his neck. He then launched them both into the air and they flung around at high speed.

        "description": "Cision engines are designed for use in RC cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles. We explain what they are, who makes them, and how much they cost.",
        "content": "Whether you're a full-fledged gearhead with a penchant for working with miniatures or a specialty RC car fan who prefers a gas-powered engine over a battery, there's a good chance you've done a little tinkering with one of the many custom-built tiny engines available on the consumer market . But even if you're more of a casual engine enthusiast who doesn't fit into either of those categories, you may be interested to know that there are currently several companies throughout the world that specialize in crafting pint-sized versions of real, fuel-burning internal combustion engines (ICE) that not only work, but have been used to power everything from RC vehicles to some small power tools. Among the most notable of the companies that specialize in making miniature internal combustion engines is Cison Engine, whose line of miniature engine packages includes everything from a powerful inline water-cooled model to a 4-stroke small-block V8 44 cubic inch that pushes 4.8 horsepower and up to 10,000 rpm. Those models are essentially exact 1⁄6-scaled versions of actual ICEs, with the power, precision, and engineering of Cison engines continuing to dazzle mini-engine enthusiasts the world over. As each of those miniatures bares some version of the Cison insignia, it should come as no surprise that the China-based engineering outfit makes its engines themselves. Yes, Cison has been manufacturing its celebrated miniatures in a Chinese facility since its 2000 founding, attributing the quality and precision of its engines, in part, to a state-of-the-art Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining setup. If the idea of building a functional miniature internal combustion engine, or merely outfitting your RC hot rod with one is intriguing to you, we have some good news and some bad news. First for the good news, which is that Cison engines are currently available for purchase to any human being who wants one, and they are being shipped from China to all parts of the globe thanks to the company's partnerships with online retailers like EngineDIY and StirlingKit. In more good news, Cison guarantees that its engines will work as advertised, ensuring you can invest in its miniatures with a certain degree of confidence. Now for the bad news, which is that Cison's miniature engines are not exactly cheap. In fact, one of the company's precision-tooled model V8 engines can set you back as much as $2,000 or more, and that isn't far from what you might pay for a full-size second-hand V8 for your car or truck. Cison's V8 miniatures are, of course, the priciest of its engine lineup, with the company offering various other models with differing power outputs at prices in the $600 to $1,000 range. Most of those engines are built to power RC cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles, and can be ordered fully assembled or in build-it-yourself packages. If you'd prefer to pick up a working miniature engine to jazz up your desktop or display in your home office, you can even pick up a model for as little as $449 that's fit with a wooden base and an on-off toggle switch.",

        "description": "It was the first time Nadal has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament, which he has won 14 times.",
        "content": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev . Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” Advertisement He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,” said the Spaniard. While Nadal said it’s doubtful he’ll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympic tennis will be at the French Open site. Monday’s match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 11⁄2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I [felt like I had] a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. Advertisement That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics, and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. The 6-foot-6-inch Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. Monday’s other winners included Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Marketa Vondrousova, Danielle Collins, Jannik Sinner, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Eighth-seeded Maria Sakkari, a semifinalist at Roland Garros in 2021, lost in the first round for the second year in a row, eliminated 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 by Varvara Gracheva.",

        "content": "KITA sering mendengar istilah . Bahkan, dalam sila ke-4 , tercatat kata musyawarah. Artinya, musyawarah menjadi nilai dan haluan dalam kehidupan bangsa. Dalam perjalanan kehidupan, baik dalam masyarakat dan bangsa bernegara, penting menerapkan musyawarah sebagai tanda bahwa negara kita selalu mengedepankan komunikasi dalam mengambil kebijakan. Berikut uraian lengkapnya. Menurut KBBI, musyawarah adalah pembahasan bersama dengan maksud mencapai keputusan atas penyelesaian masalah; perundingan; perembukan. Dalam kehidupan sehari-hari, sebagai negara yang memutuskan kebijakan secara bersama-sama, penting bagi kita untuk melakukan musyawarah atau perundingan untuk mencapai kemufakatan. Jadi, musyawarah ialah upaya bersama dalam suatu kelompok atau tingkatan untuk memecahkan persoalan dengan berkomunikasi dan mengutarakan pendapat serta opsi yang dimiliki. Dengan demikian, kebijakan atau keputusan dapat diambil. Musyawarah memiliki tujuan untuk mengambil keputusan secara bersama. Dengan melakukan proses musyawarah atau perundingan sebelum mengambil kebijakan, dapat membuat masalah lebih mudah diatasi. Ketika bersama-sama mengambil peran dan mengutarakan pendapat atas suatu masalah, akan membuat masalah dapat lebih dipetakan dan dipikirkan solusinya dengan lebih mudah. Selain itu, dengan musyawarah dalam suatu kelompok, membuat persepsi bahwa kebijakan tidak diambil secara otoriter tanpa meminta pendapat dari orang lain. Hasilnya, musyawarah dapat mempererat kerukunan dan kerja sama. Terlebih lagi, dengan melakukan musyawarah sebelum mengambil kebijakan berarti menganggap semua orang setara dan perlu dihormati haknya untuk menyampaikan pendapat. a. Berdiskusi mengenai kebutuhan yang harus dibeli. b. Membicarakan kegiatan yang dapat dilakukan. c. Berpendapat mengenai uang yang diterima dari orangtua. a. Melakukan diskusi kelompok untuk menyelesaikan tugas sekolah. b. Melakukan pemungutan suara memilih ketua OSIS dan ketua kelas. c. Berdiskusi mengenai tugas kebersihan di dalam kelas. a. Membicarakan rencana kerja bersama dengan atasan dan rekan. b. Berdiskusi mengenai tugas dan upah bersama HR. c. Mengutarakan pendapat pada saat rapat mengenai pekerjaan. (Z-2)",

        "content": "Virgil van Dijk has pledged his future to Liverpool and says he is enthusiastic about working with new head coach Arne Slot next season as he awaits clarity on his contract situation at . The 32-year-old defender has just over 12 months remaining on his current deal with the Reds and earlier this month revealed that he is yet to be offered fresh terms from the club. However, captain , who featured in 36 out of 38 games this season, has revealed that he has held positive talks with countryman Slot after he was appointed as Liverpool's new head coach and is confident the can build on their third-place finish in the Premier League. \"I still have a year left on my contract,\" said Van Dijk over the weekend as Holland began their preparations for this summer's European Championships. \"I am club captain and I have made it clear I am there for the new coach and enthusiastic over the next season. \"Obviously, there will be a lot of changes but I am confident we will make a big success of it. \"I congratulated him of course and I'm really pleased for him and his family.

        "content": "Michael Thorbjornsen of Stanford finished No. 1 in the PGA Tour University standings and secured his PGA Tour card as soon as he turns professional. Thorbjornsen, a 22-year-old from Massachusetts, was one of the top players in college golf this season and has capitalized on the tour's relatively new pathway for amateurs to qualify for the tour directly through college. Thorbjornsen accrued a high enough points average over the past two years to finish the 2023-24 NCAA season atop the rankings. Points are awarded for playing college tournaments as well as getting into professional events. Thorbjornsen has made the cut in four professional tournaments already, most recently the 2023 John Deere Classic. He placed fourth at the 2022 Travelers Championship, where he was playing on an exemption. Thorbjornsen, whose four-year Stanford career concluded when he missed the 54-hole cut at the NCAA Championship, would be eligible for the remainder of the 2024 PGA Tour season and the entire 2025 season whenever he turns pro. \"PGA Tour U is, I think, one of the best programs in all of sports,\" Thorbjornsen said in a news release from the tour. \"What they've done, creating a pathway to the PGA Tour and to these different tours underneath it, it's huge. It gives students and us golfers reasons to stay for four years, and you can't really pass up on the opportunities that they present to you.\" The PGA Tour University pathway has been tweaked and modified, and last year was the first time a player who finished No. 1 in a given season received immediate access to the PGA Tour. That player was , a Swede who parlayed his career at Texas Tech into a white-hot start to his pro career. He won one tournament apiece on the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour, played for the victorious Team Europe at the Ryder Cup, finished second to at last month's Masters and is currently ranked No. 6 in the world. \"Ludvig, even though he's been on tour for say a year now, he's top 10 in the world, he's done unbelievable things recently,\" Thorbjornsen said. \"We're good friends, we competed a lot last year, so he's someone I look up to but I'm also trying to beat him as well.\"",

        "content": "LETHBRIDGE, AB – It’s property tax season, as the City of Lethbridge says notices will be mailed out starting Wednesday, May 29, 2024. Taxes are due by June 28, and a seven per cent penalty will be applied to all unpaid 2024 balances as of June 29.

        "description": "Jay Bilas grew up idolizing Bill Walton, who was larger than life on and off the court and he was about finding the joy in others.",
        "content": "Heartbroken. That was the overwhelming feeling that washed over me when I received the call that Bill Walton had died at the age of 71. The man who was always bigger than life had passed from this one, and he left a legacy of basketball greatness and of a wonderful human being. Bill Walton was a one-of-a-kind person who left everyone he came in contact with feeling special and among his inner circle. He was a generous, giving soul who always put others before himself. As a kid growing up in Southern California, my idol was Bill Walton. He was, without argument, one of the two greatest players in college basketball history -- along with Kareem Abdul Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his college days -- and remains so to this day. Walton was the most complete center in the game: scoring, rebounding, blocking shots, passing, outlet passing and running the floor. No center was as complete, and only Kareem could match Walton's record as a winner and champion. In three seasons at playing for the legendary John Wooden, Walton's teams were undefeated national champions twice, reached the Final Four three times and compiled an 86-4 record. Walton was a three-time national player of the year and first-team All-American and was recognized as the top amateur athlete in the nation. I remember my coaches telling me that Walton was the greatest center to play the game. His NBA career was interrupted by injury. But when healthy, Walton was just as dominant as he was at UCLA. In 1976-77, he played in 65 games, leading the to the NBA championship, and he made the All-NBA and All-Defensive teams and was Finals MVP. Injuries would limit his dominance. He finished his career with the in 1985-86, helping Larry Bird, and win the title while being named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year. Walton not only overcame an injury-plagued pro career; he overcame a speech impediment to become one of the most entertaining, fun and beloved broadcasters of all time. He was amazingly intelligent, ridiculously funny and quick to poke fun at you and himself. When all would be thrilled to hear Bill talk about himself and his rich life in the game, he would never fail to ask questions about you and put the spotlight on others. He was genuinely interested in . I had the pleasure -- no, the joy -- of working with Walton at ESPN. From Maui to Pac-12 games, or the MegaCast of the college football title game (where he was dressed as Uncle Sam), not only did Bill never disappoint, he always brought a smile to your face, just thinking about spending time with him. I quickly realized that Walton was a better person than he was a basketball player -- and he was a Naismith Hall of Fame player. Before we went on the air, if I tried to discuss what we may encounter during a broadcast, Bill would put up one of his huge hands and say, \"Save it all for the air, Jake.\" He loved calling me Jake, pretending to get my name wrong, and nobody loved it more than I did -- that Bill Walton would include me in his wild sense of humor. On one broadcast with Bill and Dave Pasch, Walton was waxing poetic about former Kansas coach Ted Owens when he paused his soliloquy to say, \"Jake, you're too young to know who Ted Owens is!\" \"Of course I know Ted Owens,\" I replied. \"He recruited me.\" Walton quickly retorted, \"For what?!\" I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. Get your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. and start streaming something for everyone today! Walton made everything fun. Whether he was detailing the history of the saguaro cactus or the mystical powers of the desert, or quoting the Grateful Dead as if it were scripture, Walton was about enjoying every minute of his existence, and making your existence around him meaningful and unforgettable. He was a free spirit, with endearing eccentricity. But deep down, he was about finding joy in others. Man, was Bill Walton fun. For his greatness on the floor, Walton carved out a special place in the game's history that will never be forgotten. As a friend and colleague, Walton had a spirit that was bigger than life. He was a showman. I will always love Bill Walton -- he was a national treasure, and there will never be another like him. Rest in peace, Bill. Love, Jake",

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The head of the Social Security Administration is responding to Sen. Rick Scott. It comes after an 8 On Your Side investigation found millions of dollars missing from a St. Petersburg trust fund meant to help disabled people. Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O’Malley said his agency does not provide oversight to special needs trusts, adding a trust is a legal arrangement generally regulated by state law. Back in April, investigative reporter Brittany Muller brought the story of the missing millions to Sen. Scott . “I’ll look at it first,” he said. “That would surprise me that if there’s no oversight, but I’ll find out and if so, I’ll propose something.” Between 2009 and 2020, court records show that Leo Govoni, the founder of the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration, loaned $100M from the Center to his own company, Boston Finance Group. The Center has said Govoni has not paid that money back. It’s affected more than 1,000 vulnerable families, including 41-year-old Sarah Hall of Fort Myers . “This is the most the most disabled you can be there isn’t a degree beyond this,” said Theresa Schlosser, Sarah’s mom. “How in your conscience, do you decide to take what is helping her to live every day the best that she can live and take it away from where do you find that in your soul?” Schlosser said her daughter, Sarah, was 18 when she was in a car crash. Sarah was awarded money and monthly annuity payments so her family could take care of her for the rest of her life. “My lawyers advised me to put the money with the center which I did in 2003,” she said. “I didn’t think twice about it. I trusted these people.” She said that money has vanished. Sen. Scott wrote a letter to SSA Commissioner O’Malley demanding answers. Now, O’Malley is responding. He wrote, “The Social Security Act provides the agency with limited authority regarding financial trusts.” He also said his agency does not regulate trusts; state laws do. SSA said it does not investigate trusts, unless there investigating the misuse of someone’s benefits and that it remains focused on how the trust is treated for social security income.",

        "content": "NAC Foundation, Inc. (NACFI), the philanthropic arm of listed natural resource development company Nickel Asia Corp. (NAC) and the St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc. (SLMCFI) held an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialty medical mission at Borongan, Province of Eastern Samar from May 13-17, 2024. The mission fulfills the Memorandum of Understanding between the NACFI, SLMCFI, and the Provincial Government of Eastern Samar for the province-wide surgical-medical mission. A total of 18 major surgeries and 8 minor surgeries were carried out by the St. Luke’s team and 473 patients received medical consultations for ENT cases. Additionally, a total of 158 nurses and ancillary medical staff attended specialized lectures through the St. Luke’s Healthcare Academy. “For me, the more special portion of this aside from doing the surgery was actually doing the lectures, because if you just go to one place do the surgeries, the consultations and leave, it feels like it’s just a one-time thing that you’re able to do, but if you help the ones that are left behind, make them equipped medically with knowledge of the specialty, then they will be able to carry on the treatment necessary for the specialty,” said Head of St. Luke’s Medical Center’s ENT Department Dr. Allan Carpela. “When the Office of the Governor asked the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, we received a notification last week to ask an authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NAC and the St. Luke’s Team, agad-agad binigay namin, dahil sobrang galak kami na andito kayo na tutulong sa amin para sa mabuting kalusugan ng mga tao sa Eastern Samar,” said Eastern Samar Vice Governor Maria Caridad S. Goteesan. The goal of the partnership between NACFI and SLMCFI is to bring St. Luke’s Medical Center’s culture of care and expertise to those underserved by the public healthcare system. “Isa sa mga mahahalagang nakita namin ay ang pakikipagugnayan sa kalusugan na napakaimportante sa aming mga stakeholders, ang kalusugan sa mga pamayanan kung nasaan may operations ang Nickel Asia at ang mga programang ito ay nagpatunay na isa ito sa ugnayan ng industriya at pamayanan,” said NAC AVP for Community Relations Reynaldo Dela Rosa. This mission is one of NAC’s ways of contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 which is the promotion of good health and well-being for all. “Mula rito, umaasa po kami ng patuloy na pakikipagtulungan upang makapaghatid ng serbisyong medical kasama ang aming partner, ang St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc.,” said NAC AVP for Health Dr. Bimbo S. Almonte.",

        "description": "On Memorial Day morning families and community gathered to dedicate a new life ring at Bracken Beach. The life ring is part of a new bill going into affect in June.",
        "content": "The event included a dedication for a new bill that will go into effect in June. SB 253, or the Lake Michigan Rescue Equipment Act, will require beaches to have water safety gear like life rings at the beach. People talked and enjoyed coffee and donuts even though it was cold and windy at the beach pavilion. After coffee there were speeches and the names of drowning victims were read. 13 different families, each wearing a flower on their name tag, came to the dedication to remember their loved ones. During the ceremony state Sen. Rodney Pol, who worked on the bill, gave each of them a certificate and a flower. Evelyn Hernandez survived a drowning incident on that very beach. Unfortunately her boyfriend, Lionell Dominguez, died. She played an important part in organizing the event and getting the bill. After the incident she became a water safety advocate with the Chicago Alliance for Water Safety. The conditions on the water can change very quickly and 66% of drowning victims are strong swimmers, Hernandez said. \"It is likely that if rescue equipment had been available those drownings would have been prevented,\" Hernandez said. Dave Benjamin also nearly drowned on Dec. 26, 2010 when he went surfing on Lake Michigan. Even though he had 40 years of experience swimming he said it went \"out the window\" as the panic set in. \"Water safety is not common sense,\" Benjamin said. \"We need to elevate water safety to these standards of these other safety protocols.\" After his near drowning experience Benjamin co-started The Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project. The group tracks drowning statistics and raises awareness about water safety. The group, founded in 2011, has done 1,150 presentations in elementary through high schools. These presentations go over many different aspects of water safety. \"More school age children are going to die drowning each year than in fires, tornadoes, active shooters, earthquakes and lightning combined,\" Benjamin said. The group also advocates for more support at beaches and does lifeguard and first responder training for water rescue. Their goal is to get all eight Great Lake states to adopt water safety regulation. So far Illinois and Indiana require water safety equipment at beaches. In Michigan they are working on implementing safety programs in schools. Lifeguards are not required but Illinois has most of their beaches staffed with lifeguards. Indiana has about half of the public beaches staffed by lifeguards. \"Michigan is horrible for not having lifeguards. There's three beaches, and one's a private beach,\" Benjamin said. \"Other than that, you got to go about 230 or 250 miles to get to the next lifeguarded beach.\" Benjamin said that drowning is a public health issue that is treated as a recreational issue. According to Benjamin there have been 567 drownings in Lake Michigan since 2010 as of the end of 2023. The Great Lakes are unique because the currents and waves are caused by the weather in the area. This makes conditions in the water change quickly. Now that the bill has passed Benjamin said their next goal is to legislation that requires water safety education in school passed. \"We have come together to help raise awareness on water safety and doing it together so that our loved ones lives are not lost in vain but future lives may be preserved,\" Hernandez said.",

Gómez was attacked by gunmen when he returned home after a campaign rally, the outlet . Kidnapped Mexican mayoral candidate found alive — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) Gómez’s campaign manager was killed in the attack and two others were wounded, the BBC noted, citing local media. The mayor of a nearby town urged Mexican authorities to “take the necessary action to safeguard the life of our colleague and those of his team,” the outlet reported. Mexico’s national elections coming up June 2 have been the most violent in the country’s recent history, with dozens of candidates killed and hundreds threatened, according to the BBC. Nine people — including a child — died and 50 were injured after a stage last week at a rally for Jorge Alvarez Maynez, one of Mexico’s presidential candidates. Maynez is in third place in the polls for president, according to The Guardian. The odds-on favorite in the polls to win the presidential race is the former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, to Americas Society Council of the Americas’. Sheinbaum comes from the same party as Mexico’s current president, the left-wing Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the outlet noted. The BBC blamed criminal as the source of these threats and murders of political candidates. At present, it is not known who seized Gómez and why, the BBC reported.",

Vandalism and break-ins were the top two concerns of members. 1:54 Saskatoon police and fire report turns into call to report crimes “The NSBA recognizes the efforts being made tackling root causes, such as homelessness and addictions, but those are long-term and complex challenges, and we firmly believe that immediate actions are necessary to address the pressing issues businesses are facing,” the NSBA said. Story continues below advertisement A report from the Saskatoon Police Service (SPS) and fire department in April pointed to an increase in property crime as well as violent crimes like assaults and robberies. “Property crime in Confederation SC has also increased significantly. The most significant increase was due to Shoplifting Under $5,000 specifically at one commercial business,” the report said. Global News received a statement from SPS pointing to those same stats, adding that police will be doubling their capacity to engage in community-focused policing initiatives. “The SPS will also have five additional Alternative Response Officers trained and deployed to the street. On top of that, four new uniformed patrol officers have already been added,” SPS said.",

        "content": "WORTHINGTON — This spring, three teams from Instructor Heidi Tarus’ Principles of Biology I course participated in the Plant the Moon Challenge. With funding from NASA’s Minnesota Space Grant Consortium, they aimed to find the best way to grow nutritious food on the Moon. Two of three Minnesota West Bluejay teams earned Best in Show awards in the undergrad/professional category for their contributions to experimental design and plant growth. Six students from the Bluejays A Team focused on the effects of urea and bone meal on the growth of collard greens (Brassica oleracea). Team members were Don Huynh, Autumn Luinenburg, Jocelyn Matias, Bailey Ponto, Amarilyz Vega Hernandez, Hermela Yisak and Instructor Heidi Tarus. In their preliminary research, the team uncovered that collard greens need more than just nitrogen to grow well. They also need phosphorus and calcium. Through their experimentation, the team discovered urea might be the sole additive necessary for promoting collard green growth in lunar regolith. Through careful planning and insightful hypotheses, the Bluejays A Team made progress in finding ways to grow food on the Moon. The Bluejays C Team investigated how to grow mung beans under moon-like conditions. They looked at the effects of bone meal and endomycorrhizal fungi on growth. Eight students participated: Elijah Alexander, DaShawn Clark, Olivia Hensch, Diego Montoya, Terrence Pierre, Elijah Robinson, Adrian Sanchez, Fanuel Wolday and Instructor Heidi Tarus. ADVERTISEMENT Plants need nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium to make proteins, DNA and cell walls. The team added peat moss to the soil to help the plants grow better. They tested two things: Bone meal and fungi additives, to see how they affected plant growth. Plants in pots with bone meal and fungi grew tallest, had the most leaves, and had bigger roots. They also noticed these plants had darker green leaves. The team wants to try adjusting the soil’s acidity, adding more nutrients like potassium, and studying how fungi and plant roots work together. Through their research and innovative approaches, the experiments opened doors to a multitude of future investigations. The teams have taken significant steps toward realizing the vision of sustainable food production in space. With NASA planning missions to explore the Moon, learning how to farm there is crucial.",

But the team, especially Rick Carlisle, their front office, they want to err on the side of caution with him.\" Reporting on Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on NBA Today ahead of Game 4 pic.twitter.com/jmj2xwxp76 Haliburton, who suffered a hamstring injury in January, aggravated the injury against the Celtics in Game 2 and was sidelined for Game 3. Boston leads the series 3-0 and can close things out with a win on Monday night. Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists in Game 1 before recording 10 points and eight assists in limited action in Game 2. The fourth-year player is averaging 18.6 points and 8.2 assists per game in his first postseason. Though Haliburton has been a bit inconsistent throughout the playoffs, he has stepped up in a handful of big moments. He notched back-to-back 30+ point performances in the semifinals as well as a 26-point showing in Game 7 to close out the New York Knicks. As Wojnarowski reported, though, Haliburton's first playoff run could be over. With Boston holding a 3-0 lead, the Pacers would need a historic comeback to win the series. Game 4 tips off at 8 p.m. ET Monday night and the Celtics are looking to advance to the Finals for the second time in the last three seasons. The Pacers will look to extend their season by at least one game, but they might have to do so with their star on the bench.",

Walton played for the Celtics for two seasons in the 1980s and was a key part of their 1985-86 championship team, considered by some the greatest team in NBA history. “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. A Hall of Famer, Most Valuable Player, and two-time NBA Champion, Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals, and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history. He derived great joy from basketball and music, and deeply cherished his moments with teammates and friends. “As a Celtic, Bill overcame years of debilitating injuries, regained his zest for the game, and helped guide the 1986 Boston Celtics championship with both his play and his spirit. “The Boston Celtics celebrate Bill’s wonderful life and legacy, and send their deepest sympathies to the Walton family.” Be civil.

        "content": "CHICAGO — Many U.S. dairy farms have not yet increased health protections against bird flu for employees during an outbreak in cows, according to workers, activists and farmers, worrying health experts about the risk for more human infections of a virus with pandemic potential. Epidemiologists are concerned the virus could potentially spread and cause serious illnesses as farmers downplay the risk to workers while employees are not widely aware of cases in U.S. cattle. The U.S. government said last week that a second dairy worker contracted bird flu since cattle first tested positive in late March and that investigators are looking into whether the person was wearing or offered protective equipment. Nearly 24,000 farms sell milk around the country, and they offer varying protections to staff. Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections. Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-to-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures. ADVERTISEMENT The workers — all based in New York, a major dairy producer — said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual. \"They're not doing anything,\" he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers. CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week. New York state said it is assessing CDC's recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it. Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more. Dairies became more aware of bird flu's risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development. Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing. Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes. Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance. \"When you're milking, splashes can't be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented. Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows. In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added. ADVERTISEMENT \"We're rather isolated and I don't think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers. The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said. Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system. Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required. New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said. Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation. \"I don't want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we're doing,\" he said.

        "content": "Jeopardy! viewers are scratching their heads after an apparent change of the rules that is letting four-day winner Grant DeYoung potentially take part in the show’s next Tournament of Champions. The quiz show has caused fans to raise eyebrows in the past and raised ire recently, specifically with the announcement of a new pop culture version of the show fans feel will ruin the original. The show has suffered from losses in viewership as well over the ways that fans have felt alienated, but in the end, it is still going strong. Jeopardy prodcuer exposes little-known show rule after contestants' rare move Chris pratt's surprise Jepardy cameo slammed by fans as star plugs new movie However, DeYoung, who has also left fans confused over other rules he seemingly has broken , has proven to be the most puzzling contestant yet. After noticing a special accommodation he had during gameplay, fans also took note of a hint that he could be in the Tournament of Champions. DeYoung impressively racked up a total prize total of $81,203 after a four-day winning streak that ended on May 21. His impressive play saw Ken Jennings tell him that his four wins could make it likely he would appear in Tournament of Champions–which led fans to be confused, as the the usual requirement for participation in the tournament is five consecutive wins. However, others quickly clarified on an Instagram post that he actually could qualify. “All 4 game champions were eventually qualified at TOC in the last 3 editions,” one fan wrote. “With a shorter eligibility window and the expansion of TOC field in the last 2 editions. I think Grant might get in the 32nd TOC. Since 2021 TOC where al 4 game champions competed, some o them made it to the semifinals like: Veronica, Ryan B, Ryan H, Maureen, John & David,” they added.

The current bracket for the next tournament sees DeYoung at the bottom of the pack. It includes Celebrity Jeopardy Season 2 winner Lisa Ann Walter, who has so far won $1,000,000 for Charity. The other participants are two five-game winners. They are Alison Betts of San Jose, California, who won $121, 500, and Amy Hummel of Milwaukee, Wisconsin , who won $100,994.",

        "content": "CHICAGO — Many U.S. dairy farms have not yet increased health protections against bird flu for employees during an outbreak in cows, according to workers, activists and farmers, worrying health experts about the risk for more human infections of a virus with pandemic potential. Epidemiologists are concerned the virus could potentially spread and cause serious illnesses as farmers downplay the risk to workers while employees are not widely aware of cases in U.S. cattle. The U.S. government said last week that a second dairy worker contracted bird flu since cattle first tested positive in late March and that investigators are looking into whether the person was wearing or offered protective equipment. Nearly 24,000 farms sell milk around the country, and they offer varying protections to staff. Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections. Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-to-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures. ADVERTISEMENT The workers — all based in New York, a major dairy producer — said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual. \"They're not doing anything,\" he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers. CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week. New York state said it is assessing CDC's recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it. Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more. Dairies became more aware of bird flu's risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development. Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing. Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes. Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance. \"When you're milking, splashes can't be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented. Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows. In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added. ADVERTISEMENT \"We're rather isolated and I don't think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers. The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said. Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system. Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required. New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said. Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation. \"I don't want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we're doing,\" he said.

        "content": "Every rumor that we hear about upcoming Spider-Man movies needs to be taken with a grain of salt. As Spider-Man fans, we too often get treated to waves of speculation about what might happen in potential Spidey films, be it a Tom Holland-led Spider-Man 4 , or the presence of Spider-Man in a Sony spinoff movie such as Madame Web or Venom: The Last Dance . We’ve heard so many, however, it’s nearly impossible for us to know what’s true. The most recent rumor involves former Spidey actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield , who returned to the big screen for Spider-Man: No Way Home and might have more going on in the future... which, to me, is the only way forward for Sony. The new scoops come to us via industry “insider” DanielRPK (via FandomWire ), who claims that Sony wants Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire to return as Spider-Man in the series of films the studio is creating in its live-action Spider-Man universe . This means that Maguire and Garfield would appear opposite Morbius ( Jared Leto ), Vulture ( Michael Keaton ), Venom ( Tom Hardy ), Kraven the Hunter ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson ) and more. The reason why Sony allegedly wants Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield for its multiversal adventures is because Kevin Feige reportedly wants Tom Holland ’s Spider-Man 4 to help flesh out the street-level storytelling that has been teased in recent Marvel Studios efforts such as Echo and the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again . In the closing moments of Echo , Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) announces his plans to run for Mayor of New York City, a popular comic book storyline known as “Mayor Kingpin.” This powerful move could lead to narrative ramifications for Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Spider-Man (Holland), Moon Knight (Oscar Isaac), the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) and several other NY-based Marvel characters. If Marvel Studios truly wants to build out this corner of the universe, you can see why Feige doesn’t want Holland caught up in the Sony universe – especially after he read the Madame Web reviews . Using Tom Holland’s Spider-Man for this street-level story is another reason why I don’t want Spider-Man 4 to use the small dollop of symbiote that was left behind by Eddie Brock in Spider-Man: No Way Home . Listen to me rant about that right here. A post shared by CinemaBlend (@cinemablend) A photo posted by on The trick, however, probably lies in convincing Garfield and/or Maguire to return in something that isn’t being shepherded by Marvel. Sony’s track record in the Spider-Man spinoff universe has been suspect. The studio canceled by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 4 , and Garfield’s The Amazing Spider-Man 3 . The actors reportedly are wanted for Avengers: Secret Wars , though that’s years from now. And I’ve long argued that Sony using one of the existing Spider-Men – specifically Garfield – is the best way forward for this currently disconnected universe. Because all of these movies need a Spider-Man if Sony wants the audience to care. So why not use one of the ones who has been re-introduced in Spider-Man: No Way Home ? We’ll continue to track the progress of all the Spider-Man developments, from Tom Holland’s Spider-Man 4 to the future of Sony’s Spider universe. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News",

        "content": "A new leak reveals Apple’s most exciting iPhone in years. The iPhone 16 series launch is still a few months away. But, tech gurus are already talking about a groundbreaking iPhone for 2025. A recent report says Apple is working on a much thinner iPhone model. We had earlier talked about a slim model in the iPhone 17 lineup, but the latest report suggests something more exciting. This ultra-thin iPhone, known as D23, could be a completely new product like the iPhone X was. The iPhone X, launched in 2017, was a big change from all previous iPhones. It started a new design trend for iPhones, with a full-screen OLED display and Face ID facial recognition. iPhone designs haven’t changed much since the iPhone 11 series five years ago. But the D23 could introduce a new design trend for all future iPhones. Apple recently unveiled the new iPad Pro as its thinnest product yet, only 5.1 mm thick. The report says Apple is still exploring designs for the slimmer iPhone. One idea is an aluminium body with a smaller front camera and sensor cutout. Another idea is moving the rear cameras to the top centre of the phone’s back. The screen size will likely be between the 6.1-inch iPhone and the 6.7-inch iPhone Pro Max. The iPhone X also introduced a big price increase to $999. With the potential for another big design change, this new slimmer iPhone will likely be much more expensive than other models in the iPhone 17 lineup. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple positions this model. Will it just be a more expensive, slimmed-down version of the Pro Max, or will it have new features that make it unique? Will it be called the iPhone 17 Slim, or could it start a new “iPhone Ultra” series? While 2025 may seem far away, the idea of a major iPhone redesign is exciting.",

        "content": "Reaction from the basketball world to the death Monday of Bill Walton : “My very close friend, fellow Bruin and NBA rival Bill Walton died today. And the world feels so much heavier now. On the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn’t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy. He was the best of us.” — fellow UCLA center, NBA star and Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. “Bill was a special, kind, and genuine person. I’m incredibly grateful for our close friendship, and the time we spent together on the air, out to dinner after the game, or in his teepee in his backyard. An iconic athlete and broadcaster, but more important, a legendary person who always made me smile.” — ESPN broadcaster Dave Pasch, a longtime on-air partner of Walton. “Bill Walton was a brilliant, interesting, thoughtful, humorous and genuine soul who loved life and cared about everyone he encountered. He will be dearly missed by all of us who were fortunate enough to share his friendship.” — Dan Gavitt, the NCAA’s senior vice president of basketball. “Bill’s list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit. In the words of our friend and hero — Thank you, Bill, for our life.” — statement from the Pac-12 Conference. “From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed.” — Magic Johnson. “What a privilege to know him.” — longtime Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan. “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Walton, a basketball legend and an incredible human being. ... You will be deeply missed.” — Pau Gasol. “We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd.” — statement from the Los Angeles Clippers. “Bill Walton was a legendary player, a hilarious, colorful broadcaster and most of all a wonderful person. I fell in love with basketball watching Bill dominate at UCLA in front of packed crowds at Pauley Pavilion, and I was blessed to get to know him later in our lives when he covered the NBA as an analyst on TV. .... His incredible energy, passion, love and zest for life was never turned off. Our hearts are broken today as we mourn Bill’s passing and grieve with his family.” — Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “It's a legend lost.” — Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd.

        "description": "The basketball world is mourning the death of Hall of Famer Bill Walton. Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, according to the NBA.",
        "content": "“My very close friend, fellow Bruin and NBA rival Bill Walton died today. And the world feels so much heavier now. On the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn’t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy. He was the best of us.” — fellow UCLA center, NBA star and Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. “Bill was a special, kind, and genuine person. I’m incredibly grateful for our close friendship, and the time we spent together on the air, out to dinner after the game, or in his teepee in his backyard. An iconic athlete and broadcaster, but more important, a legendary person who always made me smile.” — ESPN broadcaster Dave Pasch, a longtime on-air partner of Walton. “Bill Walton was a brilliant, interesting, thoughtful, humorous and genuine soul who loved life and cared about everyone he encountered. He will be dearly missed by all of us who were fortunate enough to share his friendship.” — Dan Gavitt, the NCAA’s senior vice president of basketball. “Bill’s list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit. In the words of our friend and hero — Thank you, Bill, for our life.” — statement from the Pac-12 Conference. “From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed.” — Magic Johnson. “What a privilege to know him.” — longtime Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan. “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Walton, a basketball legend and an incredible human being. ... You will be deeply missed.” — Pau Gasol. “We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd.” — statement from the Los Angeles Clippers. “Bill Walton was a legendary player, a hilarious, colorful broadcaster and most of all a wonderful person. I fell in love with basketball watching Bill dominate at UCLA in front of packed crowds at Pauley Pavilion, and I was blessed to get to know him later in our lives when he covered the NBA as an analyst on TV. .... His incredible energy, passion, love and zest for life was never turned off. Our hearts are broken today as we mourn Bill’s passing and grieve with his family.” — Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “It's a legend lost.” — Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd.

        "content": "Wouldn't it be neat to see a drone using flashing blue and red lights and a siren to chase down crooks? Well, the Responder quadcopter comes equipped with both, along with other gear designed to help quicken response times when crimes or other emergencies occur. Manufactured by Seattle-based startup Brinc, the Responder is intended for use by police forces, fire departments, ambulance services and other first response agencies. Along with its lights and siren, the autonomous drone is also equipped with a 40x-zoom HD optical camera array; a thermal imaging camera; a spotlight; a two-way communications system including a speaker and microphone; plus a payload system that allows the aircraft to carry and drop life-saving items such as EpiPens, automated external defibrillators, personal floatation devices, and naloxone (for treating opioid overdoses). The idea is that multiple Responders will be stationed throughout the city, each one protected inside its own robotic Responder Station \"charging nest\" when not in use. When a 911 call is relayed to the appropriate dispatcher, that person may decide to send the closest available Responder to the location of the emergency – the aircraft can reportedly take off from its Responder Station in less than five seconds. Depending on the scenario, a slower-traveling human response team may also be dispatched. As the drone is en route, a live feed from its cameras will be relayed to the relevant emergency service via 4G, and viewed on the system-specific LiveOps browser. Once the aircraft arrives at the location – which ideally will take no longer than 70 seconds – someone from the service will be able to have a real-time conversation with the affected individual(s) using the drone's two-way communications system. This conversation may involve providing instructions on the use of a provided EpiPen, etc, or it could entail de-escalating a potentially violent situation. It is estimated that for approximately 25% of incidents, it won't be necessary to send an actual human team. The quadcopter itself can reportedly fly for up to 42 minutes at a time, with one full charge of its battery taking 40 minutes. It can fly autonomously (with help from a forward collision-avoidance system) or be remotely controlled. In the latter case, it can be piloted either onsite using a handheld remote, or from the dispatch center. Brinc is now accepting inquiries from prospective commercial or municipal clients. You can see the Responder in action, in the following video. Source:",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday. The post Nadal says Olympics is main goal after early defeat at Roland-Garros appeared first on Daily Maverick.",
        "content": "Rafa Nadal likened his struggles with injury in the past 18 months to being in a jungle as the 14-times French Open champion hoped to return to Stade Roland Garros for the Olympic Games after making a premature exit from the Grand Slam on Monday. Never far from physical issues in his glittering career, the 37-year-old missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the clay court major. Rafa Nadal of Spain reacts during his defeat to Alexander Zverev of Germany in the first round of Roland-Garros in Paris on 27 May 2024. (Photo: Ian MacNicol / Getty Images) Nadal crashed to a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris and although there were positives, he said he could not predict how his battered body would respond to the demands of the Games in July and August. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland-Garros. “I’ve been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I’ll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. “So that’s the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what’s the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can’t say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.” Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio. He had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what was probably his final French Open.

(Photo: Ian MacNicol / Getty Images) “Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,” Nadal said. “I had my chances... I mean, I wasn’t that far. That’s my feeling. That’s probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. “Of course, disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I’m happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.” Nadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grass court season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics. “It looks difficult, honestly. For me now, I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” Nadal said. “I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I’m booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Fans were left wondering if the 14-times champion would return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers’ Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier, but he ultimately went down fighting. “I’m not 100% sure if it’s the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd were amazing during the whole week of preparation and today,” Nadal said. “The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it’s special to feel the love in the place I love the most. “I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. But it’s something I don’t feel yet.” Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland-Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semifinals. “I don’t know what to say ... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it’s such a great honour,” Zverev said. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.” Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland-Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched by his great rival Novak Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on, but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

        "description": "Race attracted nearly 200 runners.",
        "content": "A field of close to 200 runners and walkers came out on Monday to take part in the annual Memorial Day 5K Flag Run with Brooklyn’s Geoffrey Scott taking the men’s portion and Melissa Kraker repeating in the women’s division. The race, run over a double loop in Brookfield Park in humid conditions, was organized by the Staten Island Running Association. In the men’s race, a duel between longtime local stalwart Chris Calimano and Scott took place over the course with Scott pulling away to victory in a time of 16 minutes, 44 seconds. Calimano (17:08) finished in second place with two-time defending champ Jose Davila (18:14) finishing third. “It was so much fun to just be a part of the race today -- winning was just the cherry on top of a good event,” said Scott. “This was my first time running the race, and I loved it. I love these small unpretentious races where folks know each other and just have a good time with each other.” Scott said he had never Calimano before but that the latter had approached him because he had recognized him from other events, but Scott said Calimano had mistaken him for someone else. They chatted for a bit and the two wound up warming up together. “We went out together at the same pace, which was great because it’s always way more fun to be able to race someone, instead of just running by yourself,” said Scott. “At the 2 mile mark, I felt like I could tell I had a bit more energy in my legs. So I started to pull away and then I just tried not to look back.” “Geoff is a strong runner and we went head-to-head until mile 2 then he dropped me,” said Calimano, Staten Island’s top ultra-marathoner. “It was great see a Brooklyn runner joining our local events.” Meanwhile, Kraker (19:57), a longtime top runner, led from the start for the women’s win, followed by Marci Kleisch (20:26) with Pamela Ricker (22:46) finishing up in third place. “I usually have the same racing strategy that I may begin to tweak and revisit,” said Kraker. “Sometimes during a shorter distance, I catch myself losing my comfortable pace by the 2.5-mile mark and slow down to the finish. “That rhythm happened today too...until my SIAC Running Captain Doug Auer shouted out, ‘she’s catching up to you’ at the final turn on the course. Then I turned from jet lagged running to full blown jet and sprinted as fast as I could towards the finish line. And I thanked Doug, too.” *** BELL LAP: Proceeds from the race went to the Merrell/Capodanno American Legion Post for the second year and The Global Academy for Community-Based Education ...

        "description": "‘These cuts underscore a failure to support the essential needs of students and educators...’",
        "content": "Staffing cuts proposed to meet the provincial requirement of a balanced budget aren’t sitting well with School District 83 trustees or the teachers’ union. At its May 21 meeting, SD83 secretary-treasurer Dale Culler reviewed the 2024-25 budget which includes significant proposed reductions to staffing, services and supplies. Tennile Lachmuth called the budget, up for first reading, the most difficult she’s faced in her six years of being a trustee (Armstrong, Spallumcheen, CSRD Area D). “Even during COVID, we thought that was tough. But this is absolutely the worst budget,” said Lachmuth, noting letters would be written to B.C.’s education ministry regarding insufficient funding from the province – a challenge faced by other school districts. “We’re all on the same page. It’s not that we’re mismanaging the money at all – we’re all roughly around the same deficit amount... we’re not being funded for this we’re not being funded for that.” Trustee Corryn Grayston (CSRD areas C, F and G) noted 88 per cent of proposed cuts affect teachers and certified education assistants (CEAs). “That is a dramatic percentage of overall reductions...,” said Grayston. “My feeling is that you know, we continue to hear from our teachers how challenging classes are, how supports are so instrumental for them to be successful...” Grayston suggested leadership go back and “see where some trimming can be done to lessen this impact.” Similarly, school board chair, trustee Amanda Krebs (Salmon Arm) advised “We look to see if there’s anything we can do on the management side to – I would even say to even it up.” “We need to find a solution,” said Krebs. “And I know there’s no magic solution out there, but we need to find something that balances a bit more. So I too believe that in this round of very difficult decisions and cuts, I would look to leadership to revisit management positions and other areas...” North Okanagan Shuswap Teachers Association president Graham Gomme shared a number of the trustees’ reactions to the proposed budget, from it being one of the worst he’s seen, to concerns about the impacts of the proposed cuts. “There’s $3 million in cuts to basically employees of School District 83 and of that, 88 per cent of that are educators and front line workers and the other 12 per cent are people working in facilities support – there’s nothing in management,” said Gomme. NOSTA provided the Observer with the following breakdown of cuts suggested in the budget. The proposed reduction in the classroom and priority learner supports: • 10 classroom teaching positions removed; • 2.6 A=alternate classroom teaching positions removed; • 2 O=online learning teaching positions removed (entire school closed and outsourced); • 1 Indigenous helping teacher position removed’ • 43 education assistants laid off; • 2 educational support workers laid off; • 4 education assistants with decreased hours; • Indigenous education worker position laid off; • 3 Indigenous education workers with decreased hours; • and 1 (of only 2) school psychologist removed. “We have education psychologists who are the ones that categorize students,” commented Gomme. “They’re the only ones qualified to do so... we have two of them and they’re actually a couple out of Kamloops and they come here to do the job and they’re cutting one of them.” Proposed cuts to facility support staff include: • 14 custodians laid off; • 3 custodians with decreased hours; •1 bus driver position laid off; • 4 ground support staff removed; • 1 payroll clerk removed. On the administration side, Gomme said one person is being added (school principal). In a public statement, NOSTA said with the various proposed cuts, “our most vulnerable students will face reduced support and resources.” “The layoffs of 43 education assistants, 2 educational support workers, and the reduction in hours for four education assistants will further strain classroom dynamics and individualized learning support,” said NOSTA. “Additionally, the elimination of one school psychologist and cuts to Indigenous Education Workers will severely impact the mental health and cultural support systems critical to many students... “These cuts underscore a failure to support the essential needs of students and educators, perpetuating a system that prioritizes management over direct educational support.” Gomme anticipates the budget will be up for a second reading at the June 18 school board meeting. He hopes anyone concerned with the proposed cuts will speak to their schools and be heard. “I didn’t see this coming, I knew they were going to make cuts but this is way beyond what I ever imagined,” said Gomme.",

        "content": "David Lynch Teases New Project Coming Next Month By Acclaimed filmmaker (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive) shared a cryptic video on social media, announcing that there will be a secret project set to be unveiled this coming Wednesday, June 5, 2024. “Ladies and gentleman, something is coming along.... for you to see and hear,” Lynch said in the . “And it will be coming along on June 5.” It has already been nearly a two decades since Lynch went on a hiatus from directing feature-length movies. His last feature directorial project was 2006’s Inland Empire, which was a psychological thriller starring Laura Dern. In addition, Lynch recently expressed his hopes of making his long-delayed animated film in the future, even though the project already got rejected by Netflix. David Lynch’s Reaction to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Movie In 1984, Lynch directed a film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel, which was led by Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides. Despite the novel’s critical success, the film failed to impressed fans during its initial theatrical run. However, as the time went by, it eventually gained a cult following. When the first installment to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune reboot was released, Lynch admitted that he in watching the Timothee Chalamet-led adaptation. “Because it was a heartache for me,” Lynch explained. “It was a failure and I didn’t have final cut. I’ve told this story a billion times. It’s not the film I wanted to make. I like certain parts of it very much — but it was a total failure for me.” Maggie Dela Paz has been writing about the movie and TV industry for more than four years now. Besides being a fan of coming-of-age films and shows, she also enjoys watching K-Dramas and listening to her favorite K-Pop groups. Her current TV obsessions right now are FX’s The Bear and the popular anime My Hero Academia. Share article Related",

        "description": "Dalit man witness in relative's killing beaten to death in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar",
        "content": "Listen to Story In a tragic turn of events in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district, a Dalit man on Sunday died in the Khurai vilage after some miscreants thrashed him for not complying with their demands of reaching a reconciliation in connection with a brawl that resulted in the death of one of his relatives, Nitin Ahirwar nine months ago, police said. The accused had called Rajendra Ahirwar (24), who was a witness of the months-old incident, to one Pappu Rajak's home to talk over the matter and get done with it. But they allegedly attacked him after he refused to give in to their demands. Both Rajendra Ahirwar and Pappu Rajak got injured in the scuffle and were admitted to the hospital where the former died during treatment. The police reached the spot and registered a case against five accused, Aashiq, Bablu, Israil, Faheem and Tantu on the basis of the statement recorded by Rajendra Ahirwar's father. Tragedy struck twice as what further shocked everyone was the death of Rajinder Ahirwar's niece Anjana, who fell off the hearse van, when it was ferrying Rajinder's body after his postmortem before it could reach Badodia village. Notably, Ranjana was the one who narrated the whole story of the attack on Rajinder Ahirwar a day before and was at the Bundelkhand Medical College during his treatment and the postmortem as well. Additional SP Sanjeev Kumar said that the investigation is underway in the entire series of events that have transpired in the last two days. Meanwhile, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh reached the residence of the deceased girl to pay his condolences and demanded proper action in the matter. The senior Congress leader demanded the district collector and superintendent of police of Sagar be sacked and said \"The administration promised to give Anjana a government job, did they give her one? They made some other promises too like demolishing houses (of the accused), did they demolish? I am not in favour of bulldozing someone's house, but you demolish many persons' houses in the name of action\". Also, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to X (formerly Twitter) and alleged that the BJP was going to change the Constitution as they didn't want women and the deprived section of society to live with dignity. Nitin Ahirwar was allegedly beaten to death by a group of people in a matter of an old enmity in Sagar last August.",

        "content": "A RUSTY 1979 Chevrolet truck has been rescued after being abandoned in woods for 30 years. A dad and son team brought chainsaws to hack away branches that were trapping the classic vehicle . \"It looks to be in awful shape but don't let looks deceive you,\" the men told other car enthusiasts on YouTube . In their 45-minute-long YouTube video, motoring gurus Patrick and his son Jacob, filming as DontbeWily ( @DontbeWily ) and DBW4shorts ( @DBW4shorts ) explained how they found the abandoned 1979 C 20 Chevy truck rusting away. \"We are going to try to start it,\" said Patrick as they carefully picked their way through the woodland on a large farm. \"This thing has been sitting here forever, and it's got a great anti-theft device on it,\" he added, referring to the branches twisting through the vehicle. The rats have been there a while, that's not good. The men found several rats' nests, an empty tank and \"no beauty mirror.\" \"They've (the rats) been there a while, that's not good,\" Patrick told his sons. While birds tweeted in the background in the isolated rural setting, the men noted that the classic vehicle had been there for so long that an oak tree had grown right around - and even through - it. \"So we have a '79 model custom deluxe Chevrolet truck that we're pretty sure has been sitting in this very spot for 35 years,\" viewers were told. When the men lifted the bonnet, Patrick was dismayed to see damage to the wires. \"I see the rats have chewed a plug... see where the rat's been in there?\" The men looked at the dipstick, and checked the vehicle's air con system. There was confusion over some of the wiring - with it possibly being tampered with in the past few decades, Patrick added. The keys were still in the ignition, but the engine didn't immediately start. Minutes later, with Patrick working his magic on the abandoned vehicle , he told his son he was going to \"put the transmission in gear and just see if it moves.\" Incredibly, the men managed to get the truck started. \"I think the next thing is driving it out of here, sounds pretty good!\" Patrick added. He then introduced viewers to the farmer whose late father owned the abandoned vehicle - one of several on the property. \"I got the privilege of meeting him (the man's dad),\" he said. Martell's Salvage yard in Wishek, North Dakota, has been run by a single family for four generations, with cars, trucks, and tractors spanning over 70 years. Sitting on over 100 acres, the yard claims to have thousands of vehicles available for restoration selling for only a few thousand dollars. The 38-acre Colorado Auto & Parts wrecking yard was established in 1959, and features jaw-dropping muscle cars from the 1960s and 1970s. In Kansas a junkyard is filled with vehicles from the 1960s to the 1980s, all in varying conditions. Included in the mix is a vintage variety of third and fourth-generation Chevrolet Impalas, a 1961 Buick LeSabre, a 1958 Chevrolet Delray, and a smattering of Ford and Mopar models. Dozens of American classics - like a 1968 Chevy Chevelle SS, a 1980 Pontiac Trans Am, and a 1970 Chevy Nova SS, were filmed by drone in the US ahead of a huge sell-off. Hundreds of decaying cars have also been discovered in a New Jersey forest. A 40-year-old collection of cars went under the hammer after its owner decided to part ways with nearly 300 rusting relics . There was a lengthy discussion about using chainsaws to chop away thick oak branches piercing parts of the Chevy truck. The clip was applauded by fellow classic car enthusiasts, who enjoyed watching the difficult - but ultimately successful - mission. \"For it to have sat so long, it fired right up. It might need some transmission fluid and the brakes freed up. Great job guys! Thanks for sharing!\" posted one man. \"That old Chevy fired right up - l am glad that you and Jacob got it all freed up and ready to move out of its spot, good video,\" wrote another. \"Nice to see old trucks like that, and it still starts. Hard to find trucks like that, they almost don't exist. Love the content keep it coming,\" asked one viewer. The dad and son also recently shared an inside look at an old chicken farm that was turned into a vintage car graveyard . Some of the damaged vehicles had been sitting there for decades, with many covered in rust. One of the main highlights of this particular barn was a 1959 Chevrolet Corvette that was last on the road in 1984. Also in the U.S, a family has been busy buying and selling junk cars for nearly 70 years, establishing itself as more than just a yard in the community.",

        "content": "Canada’s main stock index posted a small gain Monday, helped by strength in energy and industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 52.51 points at 22,373.38. With U.S. stock markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, things were relatively quiet north of the border since Wall Street has a lot of sway over Bay Street, said Les Stelmach, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. In Canada, this week will bring earnings from major banks after TD kicked off the group last week. The bank reported lower profits for the quarter as it booked costs related to U.S. investigations into its anti-money laundering program. Investors will be looking for how much money the banks are setting aside for bad loans, said Stelmach. “I think bank earnings have been resilient through most economic cycles, but there’s just a continuing theme about stress on the consumer, higher mortgage rates, rollover of mortgages, as we persist in this higher interest rate environment,” said Stelmach. Story continues below advertisement “I don’t think you’ll see anything earth-shattering in the quarterly results,” he added. The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. As has been the case in recent months, markets will be eyeing the banks’ outlooks for the rest of the year, said Stelmach, reflecting ongoing uncertainty after expectations for interest rate cuts have been rapidly dwindling as the year progresses.

What changes could the retailer make off public markets? Canadian MPs vote to ban replacement workers with ‘anti-scab’ bill “Inflation is still a concern in the U.S. particularly, and so that might keep (the U.S. Federal Reserve) on the sidelines longer than people think,” he said. Heading into 2024, markets were pricing in about six rate cuts by the Fed this year, said Stelmach, but that’s been pared back significantly. Now, many market watchers think it’s possible that the central bank could cut just once in 2024, after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data has dampened hopes for lower rates. Trending Now Thousands of NÜTRL tumblers recalled after dozens report illness 369 stolen vehicles from Ontario worth $33M recovered, many at Port of Montreal In Canada, the economic data is much more supportive of a rate cut, said Stelmach, but the Bank of Canada is in a tough spot because it doesn’t want to diverge too much from the Fed. Diverging too much could affect the Canadian dollar, he said, and put Canada in a difficult position if any economic surprises change the trajectory of rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. This week will also bring economic reports in the U.S. on consumer confidence, GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which Stelmach said is another important indicator of inflation. Story continues below advertisement “The U.S. economy more broadly has been stronger than people have expected it to be,” he said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.34 cents US compared with 73.14 cents US on Friday. Commodity markets were also closed for the U.S. holiday.",

        "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that she would not be able to attend the meeting of the INDIA alliance on June 1 as the last phase of voting in West Bengal will be held that day. Addressing an election rally in Kolkata , Banerjee said, “The INDIA bloc earlier said they would hold a meeting on June 1. I told them I wouldn’t come as we will still have polls here like a few other states. How can I go when there is a cyclone and relief operations going on the one hand and elections on the other?” Earlier, Banerjee had that the TMC would support the INDIA alliance from outside but later she changed her stand saying the coalition is her brainchild and she is very much part of it. Advertisement Pointing out that the party has so far attended all meetings of the Opposition bloc, sources in the TMC said Banerjee, party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and other top leaders would be voting on June 1. The TMC had conveyed this to the alliance organisers, they added. Voting will take place in nine seats in West Bengal on June 1. Citing relief work in the cyclone-affected area as her priority , Banerjee on Monday said, “My focus is ensuring relief for people. I am holding a meeting here but my heart lies with the affected people.” “This time too, there has been a lot of damage in our state due to the Cyclone Remal. The loss of lives is above everything else. Fortunately due to the action of the state administration, the loss of life this time is comparatively less,” Banerjee said.",

        "description": "A new university program brings in Indigenous business owners to engage with students — and it's having positive results for those involved.",
        "content": "Whadjuk Ballardong woman Rebecca Barlow has learned a fair bit in the six years since she began her fashion label Deadly Denim. She's a creative person — and there are some more mundane aspects to running a business she simply doesn't have the time or the skills to cover. But when she was asked by a Perth university to take part in a course bringing together students and Indigenous business owners like herself, she was in. The Edith Cowan University unit, Retail Marketing, sees students use First Nations owned enterprises as their real-world case-study for assignments like developing a marketing strategy or redesigning their website. Ms Barlow, whose work has been shown at fashion shows across Australia, and , said it was about creating a safe space for the students to learn in an inclusive and diverse workforce. \"I often get asked, because I'm very fair [skinned], if I'm allowed to do what I do, and I've never been offended by that. I think that's really great that people ask,\" she said. Opportunities for reconciliation Lecturer Melissa Fong-Emmerson said the unit had input from Indigenous colleagues, mentors, friends and communities. \"[We are] including their views of the world in a strength-based way, and in a way to decolonise the marketing industry and higher education,\" she said. \"It's a transition from a culture of exclusion to one of inclusion. \"As educators, we are well positioned to prepare our students for multicultural, diverse workforces, while also promoting reconciliation and better outcomes by recognising the importance of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. \"We want to be able to use the power of education as a force for growth and good.\" Space for 'mob to be seen and heard' Nyikina woman and artist Molly West took part in the course last year with her small business, Bilya Djinda. \"Aboriginal people, like all First Nations people, have been educators for tens of thousands of years, with each generation responsible for passing on that knowledge to the next,\" the 18-year-old from Northam said. \"Over the last few centuries Aboriginal people's voices have been oppressed, and this really important cycle of knowledge sharing was interrupted, which meant that our stories weren't being shared and our culture not understood. \"So what we need to do now is create the new cycles of First Nation knowledge, which is exactly what's happening when we create that space for us mob to be seen and heard.\" Marketing student Jessie Barnes worked with Ms Barlow and Deadly Denim two years ago, picking up some design work for the company after completing the unit. \"It was really important to learn about the cultural differences and the backgrounds so that we could respectfully represent her business,\" she said. Another student, Olivia Warner, worked with Ms West more recently and said the opportunity had provided her with so much more than simply learning aspects related to her degree. \"I am very conscious of the fact that I don't have a network of people around me with any Indigenous culture at all,\" she said. \"I think the beauty of [this] unit, and the message behind it, is that this is the place to have those kinds of conversations. \"Teaching university students to have these kinds of conversations, empowers them to have these kinds of conversations once they leave uni and challenge that in institutions.\" As a passionate educator, Ms West – a descendant of the Stolen Generation – couldn't agree more. \"Education of our culture should be incorporated across as many fields as possible as it impacts so much whether we're discussing land management, art, history, teaching, storytelling, etc,\" she said. \"And who better to learn all this from than Aboriginal people. \"There's a saying that I really, really love: 'nothing about us, without us'. \"It's a really important concept to keep in mind that if First Nations people are being discussed, we should be included in that discussion.\" And Ms West said decolonising universities and other Western practices and institutions provided a safe space for Aboriginal people to be themselves. \"And by being ourselves, we get to excel and do some really incredible things,\" she said.

        "content": "By IAN NICHOLAS QUILLEN, Associated Press BALTIMORE (AP) — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston’s Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as the Red Sox lost their third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles’ six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez of the Red Sox hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore’s Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell’s 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn’t retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore’s lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox’s Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O’Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston’s 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April. Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during baseball season.

        "description": "What happened to Trista Sutter? Isi she still married or sick? Here's a timeline of her husband's posts about her being missing , where she went and where she is now.",
        "content": "Trista Sutter confirmed she's “happy and healthy” following time away from her husband, Ryan Sutter, and their two kids . The first bachelorette's whereabouts, relationship status and health were questioned after her firefighter husband posted a message about missing her and not being able to contact her. In a lengthy post on May 25, the former reality star explained her absence, writing that “an opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself” and she took it.However, she did not further clarify what happened and where she went. The original couple met and got engaged during the first season of \"The Bachelorette,\" the spinoff \"Bachelor\" series, in 2003. They are parents to son Maxwell, 16, and daughter Blakesley, 15. Married over 20 years, the couple previously told TODAY in 2015 that they credit their successful marriage to making time to develop their relationship. “It’s just like your job,” Trista Sutter said. “You have to put in the time and effort and energy that you do into everything else in your life. And I feel like (Ryan and I) do that. We’ve had our bumps in the road, just like anyone else, but it’s really about staying focused on each other and dedicating time to each other.” Read on for more on what happened to Trista Sutter and what Ryan Sutter posted about his wife. What happened to Trista Sutter? Trista Sutter and her husband Ryan Sutter both said she took some time away from her family. It's unclear where she went, what she did or for how long she was gone. In a May 17 post, Ryan Sutter wrote , “Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit.” He explained that “an opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family’s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us.” Additionally, the former dancer also shared similar sentiments when she broke her silence, writing in part, “An opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself and with the unconditional support of my family and friends, I chose myself and betterment, knowing that my stay-at-home-mom job and my kids end-of-the-school-year needs were in the best, most capable hands.” She said she would share “the rest of the story” in due time. What did Ryan Sutter post about Trista Sutter? In mid-May, Ryan Sutter began sharing seemingly cryptic posts on Instagram about how much he missed his wife, Trista Sutter, and how he wished that he could talk to her. At the time, he didn't share her whereabouts or if something had happened to her. May 11: Ryan shares first post about missing Trista On May 11, 2024, Ryan Sutter posted a black-and-white photo of the former physical therapist looking out at the ocean. “They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder. I can think of only a handful of days I have not, at minimum, spoken to this incredible woman. She is the love of my life and my best friend,” he wrote. “I cannot imagine loving her any more or any more fondly.” He concluded the post, “But I guess we’re gonna find out.... I miss her already.” May 12: Ryan says he wishes Trista was with them for Mother's Day Ryan Sutter continued to post about his wife’s absence in a Mother’s Day post on May 12 . In it, he wrote, “I know you wish you were here for Mother’s Day. We wish you were too. But sometimes being a mom means letting go of their hands, granting independence and stimulating their courageous spirit.” He added in part, “Sometimes you have to go away so they know you’ll come back, that your love is not limited by distance or difficulty or time. Sometimes you have to do what you sometimes have to do.” At this point, he started to get comments asking if Trista Sutter was OK, while others praised his way with words. “What is going on here? Concerned...” one person commented, while another added, “Ryan, you have such a beautiful way with words. I love how you love and support your wife, while also allowing for the growth of your children while she’s away. Such a great husband and father. Cheers to you and Trista.” May 17: Ryan says he wishes he could talk to Trista By May 17, the father of two shared a selfie of him and Trista Sutter, along with a message dedicated to her. \"I really wish I could talk to you. Ask you how you’re doing? How was your day. I’d really like to hear your voice — just for a minute. So many times I’ve called without much to say, not realizing how lucky I was or how much I’d miss the opportunity if it were gone,” he began. “I want to know how you’re doing. I want to support and encourage and cheer you on. I want to be there for you. But I can’t. And that’s OK cause I know you need this time — time to discover yourself again,” he added. Ryan Sutter continued, writing how he would be there for her when she returns, “I’ll be here to listen to you, to smile with you, maybe cry with you — I’ll be here to love you... I’ll be here... forever.” May 17: Ryan says 'Trista is fine' As the fireman kept posting and receiving comments asking about his wife, he shared the first update about her. Ryan Sutter began by noting that he likes to write what is on his mind, with no intention of deceiving or misleading anyone. “Trista is fine. We are fine. We’re great. Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit,” he then shared . “An opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family’s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us.” He concluded, “I miss her. We miss her.” May 21: Ryan explains his messages about Trista After the posts began to get media attention, Ryan Sutter attempted to explain why he was posting messages for Trista Sutter in a May 21 caption. He said he “chose to post a message\" for his wife \"for a time when she could eventually read it.\" \"She understood the context and so did I. No one else did however, and that’s where things went sideways,” he continued. He brought up rumors that she had died, that their marriage was \"in trouble\" or that she was experiencing a midlife crisis, “among many other creative ideas.” He discredited “intentionally misleading people in order to somehow benefit from it,” but decided to speak out after friends and the media started speculating about their lives. “All because I missed my wife and chose to share how that felt,\" he said. Sutter, who works as a firefighter and says he drives “a pickup to a blue collar job,” feels “pretty normal” and wasn’t expecting his posts to get pickup. But he acknowledged that 21 years ago, he was “pretty famous,” and this attention was a reminder of “how crazy life was” back then. “To be honest, it also felt good to know people still cared, and worried and wondered. It felt good to be noticed and inspired me to do better at paying attention to others — when they do good or when they need help,\" he said, ending with the hashtag #life. He reassured people that everything was OK. What did Trista Sutter say about her absence? May 25: Trista Sutter breaks her silence Weeks after Ryan Sutter's first post directed at her, the former Bachelorette shared an update and explained her absence. In a lengthy Instagram post, she joked, “Geez people. Can’t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?!” She then added, “In all seriousness, for those concerned, I’m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful. For those who’d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that.” At this time, the former reality star echoed her husband's words about “an opportunity for perspective and personal growth\" presenting itself and she took it. She explained that her reserved husband decided to share his love for her in messages that she would read during her travels. “We look at Instagram like a digital diary. Most of the time, the world doesn’t pay too much attention.

We found out it’s true. It also makes the heart more grateful, more sympathetic, more appreciative for what someone does for you, with you, alongside of you. It brings questions and wonder and worry and then answers and peace and celebration. It brought time for reflection, for projects, prayer and independence but mostly it brought joy at its conclusion. Real joy. And that’s really what it’s all about...\" he wrote.",

        "description": "The visit came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged Ukraine's allies to rethink their restrictions on Kyiv usng Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a key demand of the Ukrainian President.",
        "content": "Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky called on Monday on the West to \"use all means\" to force Russia to peace talks during a visit to Madrid, which pledged one billion euros in military aid as a Russian offensive gained new ground. The visit came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged Ukraine's allies to rethink their restrictions on Kyiv usng Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a key demand of the Ukrainian President. \"We need to intensify our joint work with our partners to achieve more. Security and tangible coercion of Russia to peace by all means,\" Mr. Zelensky told a joint press conference with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Also read: G-7 ministers cite ‘progress’ but no done deal on Russian assets for Ukraine Russia meanwhile announced it had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, the lastest in a series of gains in recent weeks. Ukraine said that France would soon send military instructors. On the back foot, Ukraine has been pressing its backers - especially the United States - to allow it to use longer-range weapons they supply to hit targets inside Russia. Washington and other allies have been reluctant to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow. Mr. Zelensky pressed home the point in Madrid. \"We need to work together and put pressure not only on Russia, but also on our partners to give us the opportunity to defend ourselves against Russia,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"Even those partners who are afraid to give this or that advice should understand that air defence is defence, not attack,\" reiterating his call for aerial defence systems capable of intercepting the 3,000 aerial bombs hitting Ukraine each month. There are signs of a Western rethink. Mr. Stoltenberg told NATO lawmakers in Sofia on Monday that the time had come to reconsider lifting those restrictions. \"If (Ukraine) cannot attack military targets on Russian territory then it ties one hand of the Ukrainians on their back and makes it very hard for them to conduct defence.\" On Sunday, however, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposed giving Ukraine greater flexibility on Russian targets. \"I think we have to be very careful,\" she told Italian television. Earlier this month, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine had every right to use British-donated missiles to strike inside Russian terrority. Questioned on Monday, Mr. Sanchez was evasive, saying he \"had no such desire\". \"We will be at Ukraine's side for as long as it takes,\" Mr. Sanchez said, announcing a military aid package as part of a security pact \"to enable Ukraine to strengthen its defence capabilities.\" Patriots needed Ukraine is calling for U.S. Patriot air defence systems to counter Russian bombardments, arguing that it has only a quarter of the resources it needs. In Madrid, Mr. Zelensky said he needed \"seven additional Patriot systems,\" including \"at least two for Kharkiv,\" which is close to the Russian border and is being regularly shelled. Mr. Sanchez said Spain had already sent Patriot missiles to Kyiv, and is \"working with various allied countries to see exactly\" how many more launchers can be sent. In a separate effort, French military instructors would soon arrive in the war-battered country, Kyiv's army chief Oleksandr Syrsky said Monday \"I have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres soon and get acquainted with their infrastructure and personnel,\" Mr. Syrsky said on social media. Russians take two more villages Less than three weeks before a Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland, Zelensky ruled out proposals by China and Brazil to invite Russia \"because Russia will block everything.\" Mr. Zelensky had been due to visit Madrid on May 17, but postponed his trip after Russian troops began a major assault on the Kharkiv region. Russia on Monday claimed to have captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, where a strike on a hypermarket in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, killed 16 people on Saturday. A new strike on an industrial zone in the city killed a woman on Monday, authorities said. A separate Russian attack on the village of Snigurivka in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv left three dead, including two teenagers, and wounded six more, the regional governor said.

In his video, Jimmy Darts films himself asking Linda, a woman who had been living on the streets for almost a decade, for food. In response, the 76-year-old woman offers Jimmy most of her food, insisting he take it without asking for anything in return. After Linda, who lives on the streets in Costa Mesa, California , gives him a stack of food, she assures the 28-year-old that she still has something to eat 'I have $1,000 for you,' Jimmy then tells a bewildered Linda. 'I was just helping out the first person to help me.' The internet has raised more than $44,000 for homeless woman after her kind gesture for TikTok creator Jimmy Darts went viral Linda, who is seen getting emotional in the video, tearfully responds by saying she was going to use the money to sleep in a motel for the night rather than the tent she had been sleeping in - even in the stormy weather. Overwhelmed by her generosity and kindness, thousands of TikTok users donated to her cause via a GoFundMe page , initially aiming to raise more than $30,000 for her - a goal that was surpassed. Jimmy reunited with Linda to share the news, and documented her reaction in a TikTok, which has been viewed more than 7.2 million times. 'I can get a van,' she said emotionally. 'That's my next step from getting up off the street. 'I need to get a van where I can sleep, I can work, I can take care of myself, I can be mobile.' 'I know which one I'll get,' she added. 'I know which one - I've been watching one.' In a follow-up video, Jimmy added that $44,000 had been raised through the GoFundMe page in the end, which allowed Linda to move into her own place and buy a van. 'The only word I can think of - but it's not big enough - is humbled that I am in this group, that you have helped,' she gushed. Overwhelmed by her generosity and kindness, thousands of TikTok users donated to her cause via a GoFundMe page, which she said she was using to buy a new van @jimmydarts Linda is now off the streets 🥹❤️ ♬ original sound - Jimmy Darts On the GoFundMe page for Linda, Jimmy shared more of her story. 'She told me that she's been homeless since 2015 and that she became homeless so that she could help understand and help them more,' he said. 'Her mission is to help the homeless in a deeper way and help them get the real sustainable help they need.' 'I love that this is her mission and I want her to have more than enough to help the homeless,' he wrote compassionately. 'Let's make sure that she is taken care of and more and if she ever wants to stay at a hotel or get a small place of her own to go in and out of.' 'Linda is my hero,' he concluded on the GoFundMe page. According to figures from 2023's U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Homeless Assessment Report, California accounted for 49 per cent of all unsheltered people in the country, which is around 123,423 people. This is nearly eight times the number of unsheltered people in Florida, the state that has the next highest number. Additionally, at 75 per cent, California had the second-highest rate of homeless people staying in unsheltered locations.

        "description": "A judge has ruled in favour of a man for injuries caused by 'ECT torture'.",
        "content": "By Jimmy Ellingham of RNZ A former patient of the child and adolescent unit at Lake Alice psychiatric hospital has won a court appeal for ACC to cover injuries suffered during electric-shock torture. The man, whose name is suppressed, was denied cover by the corporation for cognitive impairment, mental disorder and burn injuries for when he was forced to undergo electroconvulsive therapy, known as ECT, in the mid-1970s. The man was aged in his mid-teens at the time. But after a hearing late last month, Judge Denese Henare ordered ACC to cover the man for burn injuries, a brain injury and cognitive impairment caused by “ECT torture”. “While the claim seeks cover for injuries as treatment injuries the evidence shows the ECT administered at Lake Alice was not anything like treatment, it was ECT torture,” Judge Henare said in her just-released decision. She instead classed the injuries to the man as a personal injury, and ACC must fund neuropsychological testing to find its extent. The judgment did not order any sums of money but ACC must pay the man’s costs. The ECT was administered by the unit’s lead psychiatrist Dr Selwyn Leeks on a machine he modified to make the shocks more powerful. The Lake Alice unit, in Rangitīkei, closed in the late 1970s when Leeks moved to Australia. He died two years ago, having never faced justice for his actions. Shortly before his death police said there was enough evidence to charge him but he was unfit to face trial. In 2023, ACC covered the man for physical injuries - sprains, strains, contusions and a minor head injury “relating to the unconventional ECT administered”. It also accepted cover for post-traumatic stress disorder as a mental injury. The man did not think this went far enough, saying he still was not getting help for his cognitive problems and ACC was not adequately recognising the injuries he received. He had long-standing memory problems and could not even recall properly one of his children, who had died. The judge agreed with the man. The man filed a claim with ACC for cognitive impairments in 2016. ACC initially declined claims in 2018. In 2019, a reviewer upheld its decision not the provide cover for a brain injury, as no specific personal injury could be identified, and for the burn injury, due to the absence of evidence from the time. However, the man said records from Lake Alice were not accurate. Despite this, those records were relied on by psychiatrists when assessing him. The man said he was rendered unconscious by ECT many times at Lake Alice, in either planned sessions or those administered as punishment. He was also injected with painful paralysing drug, paraldehyde. ‘The events of Lake Alice cannot be forgotten’ “[He] said the effects of the abuse, cruelty and torture that he suffered were not just confined to his time at Lake Alice. They had been lifelong,” Judge Henare said. The man and his family had suffered as a consequence of what happened to him, and he might have given up if not for the support of his wife. Dr Amanda Faulkner, a consultant psychiatrist, examined the man. She said it was often overlooked that children and young people received ECT on a machine Leeks had changed, so it was not like conventional shocks which lasted for seconds. “The shocks [the man] received, as also described by multiple other Lake Alice survivors, lasted as long as 20 minutes and with no muscle relaxant or anaesthetic,” Faulkner said. “Children from as young as 4 years old, including [the man], were given these shocks to the point of rendering them unconscious, sometimes multiple times in one day.” ACC said the man’s claim was challenging. It was difficult gathering evidence as it was filed 40 years after the events. It was hard to find experts willing to talk about the effect of ECT in general, and specifically for the man. Its lawyer Fenella Becroft said ACC did not deny what happened at Lake Alice, and the judge praised her for working to achieve solutions to the case. Judge Henare said the man deserved compassion for what he had been through. His brutal treatment at the hands of Leeks was horrifying. “The dark backdrop of this claim is incredibly significant. The grim and appalling events of Lake Alice cannot be forgotten and they cannot be swept under the carpet.” The man told RNZ he was still digesting what the decision meant. “Why should it be so hard and cost so much to get what you are entitled to after being injured, and why have so many GPs shied away from supporting my claim over the years?” he asked. “None would fill the forms I needed over the last 45 years. The system is not working for the injured. “Now I have to jump through many more hoops and form-filling to claim for injury that is made so complicated, many must just give up.” Share this article",

        "content": "Police say a man has been charged with attempted murder and other offences after he allegedly used a knife to slash cars, then attacked a motorcyclist riding in North Vancouver, B.C., over the weekend. RCMP say they received several reports Saturday afternoon about a man with a knife near an intersection south of the Deep Cove neighbourhood. A statement issued Monday by police spokesman Const. Mansoor Sahak says the man damaged a number of cars before striking the motorcyclist's helmet and causing him to fall off his bike near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road. District of North Vancouver Mayor Mike Little said Saturday that, based on his conversations with witnesses, the attacker appeared to be in \"distress\" and began assaulting a motorcyclist. He was told the situation could have been far worse if not for the motorcyclist's safety gear and quick actions of a bystander. \"When the motorcyclist retreated from the attacker, a quick-thinking individual opened his car door, allowing the motorcyclist to take refuge while the attacker continued banging on the vehicle,\" Little recounted. Sahak said in the statement that the motorcyclist suffered minor injuries. The statement says numerous officers arrived on the scene within minutes and took the suspect into custody, where the man allegedly assaulted an officer. Police say the man from North Vancouver has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assaulting a police officer, and weapon possession.",

        "content": "ANN/ THE STRAITS TIME – Factory output in Singapore continued to slide in April, but the decline rate was significantly lower than the previous month, despite being worse than analysts’ forecasts. Manufacturing production fell 1.6 per cent in April compared to the same month in 2023, a notable improvement from the 9.2 per cent drop recorded in March. The sector has experienced a turbulent period, with 12 consecutive months of decline up to October 2023 and only four months of gains since then. Excluding the biomedical cluster, output in April actually rose 1.7 per cent year on year, according to Economic Development Board data released on May 24. The biomedical cluster saw the most significant decline, shrinking 29.1 per cent in April, primarily due to the pharmaceuticals segment, which plunged 54.6 per cent because of lower output for products and a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The cluster’s decline came despite a 13.6 per cent increase in the medical technology segment on the back of higher export demand for devices. The electronics cluster slid 1.1 per cent year on year. While parts of the cluster expanded, they were unable to offset the 2.6 per cent contraction in semiconductors, which account for the bulk of Singapore’s electronics output. On the flip side, all the remaining sectors expanded, led by transport engineering, which appeared to fire on all cylinders, with output climbing 10.6 per cent. The marine and offshore engineering segment stood out in the transport engineering sector with production surging 18.8 per cent, supported by improved activity in the shipyards, as well as increased output in oil and gas field equipment. Aerospace fared well too, with output up 8.2 per cent amid higher demand from commercial airlines as travel demand worldwide continued to recover strongly. Only the land segment contracted, down three per cent. Output also expanded in general industries, which grew 7.3 per cent; chemicals, up 3.1 per cent and precision engineering, ahead 2.9 per cent. Economists told The Straits Times that the weakness in semiconductor manufacturing was unexpected.Essec Business School’s Associate Professor Jamus Lim said, “Indeed, I am a little surprised by the downturn in electronics.",

        "content": "CHICAGO — George Springer, Bo Bichette and David Schneider homered, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the lowly Chicago White Sox 5-1 on Monday. Chris Bassitt struck out seven in five scoreless innings as Toronto stopped a three-game slide. Bassitt (5-6) allowed five hits and walked none against his first major league team. Springer connected in the second inning after Daulton Varsho reached on a two-out walk against Nick Nastrini. It was Springer's fourth homer of the season. Bichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center. Nastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four. Last-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history. Gavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base. Chicago trailed 3-1 before Schneider hit a two-run shot off John Brebbia with two out in the ninth. Schneider's drive to left drove in Springer, who led off with a single. Andrew Benintendi had three of Chicago's 10 hits. Sheets and Corey Julks each had two hits. The White Sox loaded the bases in the first but failed to score. Paul DeJong flied to right for the final out. TRAINER'S ROOM Blue Jays: RHP Chad Green (right teres major strain) joined the team in Chicago on Monday following his rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo. Manager John Schneider said he could be activated as early as Tuesday. ... RHP Bowden Francis (right forearm) will pitch Tuesday for Buffalo in what likely will be his final rehab appearance before he is activated from the injured list. UP NEXT Toronto's Kevin Gausman (3-3, 4.47 ERA) will face fellow right-hander Mike Clevinger (0-3, 6.75 ERA) on Tuesday. Gausman struck out 10 in six innings in a 9-1 win at Detroit on Thursday. Clevinger has lost each of his last two starts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston's Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles' six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore's Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell's 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn't retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore's lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox's Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. TRAINER'S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O'Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston's 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April.",

        "content": "ANN/THE STAR – Malaysia has overtaken Thailand as Southeast Asia’s second-largest auto market, following Indonesia. This shift marks a significant change in the region, a crucial area for Asian automakers. Nikkei Asia analysed sales data from industry groups in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The data revealed Malaysia’s auto sales, which had long been third, surpassed Thailand’s for three consecutive quarters through January to March 2024. The Malaysian Automotive Association reported a five per cent increase in auto sales in the first quarter compared to the previous year, reaching 202,245 vehicles. This followed with an 11 per cent increase in 2023, resulting in a record 799,731 vehicles sold. Sales tax exemptions for domestically produced vehicles – part of the government’s economic stimulus package – provided a tailwind for the national car brands Perodua and Proton, which held about 60 per cent of the market share. The tax exemptions started during the pandemic year of 2020, and although they ceased in mid-2022, the fulfillment of tax-free bookings continued to boost figures in 2023, according to the association. “Many new model launches including electric vehicles (EVs) with very competitive prices helped to spur sales,” it said in a statement. Toyota sales agent Ivan Khoo told Nikkei Asia that sales in the first two months of 2024 were better than expected and that the Vios was the most popular model, as it is priced below MYR100,000. “I see both segments, for Toyota’s ICE (internal combustion engine) and hybrid cars, will continue to do well,” Khoo said.",

The 6-3, 7-6(7/5), 6-3 loss to the fourth seed was only the second time in 19 attempts that Nadal lost a match at Roland Garros before the quarterfinals.

The noise on the court was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out \"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\" whenever he found the occasional moment of brilliance to remind them of any of his 14 runs to the crown in Paris. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Nadal stepped out onto the court and continued to do so for every act thereafter, no matter how mundane or regulation. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open (he exited in the third round due to walkover in 2016). He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but . And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. \"It's difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard, whose young son, Rafael Jr, sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100 per cent sure.\" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. While Nadal said it is doubtful he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics' tennis competition will be held at the French Open's site. The 22-time grand slam champion was simply unable to play at his usual level after 18 months of hip and abdominal injuries as evidenced by the match ending, in anticlimactic fashion, with a trademark lasso forehand flying wide and long. \"I tried everything to be ready for this this tournament for almost 20 years and today,\" he said. \"The last two years I have been going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here and at least I did. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\" That has historically not been the case for Nadal in France, but on this day it was.",

        "content": "The battle over Elon Musk’s compensation package is heating up as a big advisory firm is recommending shareholders vote against it, and Musk fans are resorting to scare tactics. Over the last few weeks, Tesla shareholders have been voting on several new proposals put forward by the board. The two main proposals that the board is trying to get through are a new vote on Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package and moving Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas. The two are closely related as Tesla’s board and Musk have blamed the fact that they lost a lawsuit invalidating the 2018 compensation package on the fact that the lawsuit happened in Delware, where Tesla is incorporated. Tesla incorporated in Delaware, like many other American companies, because the states has laws extremely favorable to corporations. However, Musk believes, without any evidence, that the judge’s decision was politically motivated and believes that Tesla would have better luck in Texas. And Tesla will need better luck because the new shareholder’s vote on the compensation package doesn’t automatically invalidate the judge’s decision to rescind the package and more legal challenges are expected. Tesla’s own lawyers admit it’s basically a poll. Regardless, Tesla has been pushing hard for shareholders to revote in favor the package and the move to Texas. As we previously reported, and even started . The shareholder battle is starting to heat up. We recently reported on and encouraged other shareholders to do the same. Now Glass Lewis, a major shareholder advisory firm whose clients include a significant part of major institutional investors, announced that they are also recommending to vote against it, which they also did in 2018, and shareholders still approved the move. On the other hand, Musk’s army of fans are resorting to scare tactics to push the vote in his direction. We recently reported on Musk’s unless he has 25% control over the company. It was confirmed today that Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, has raised $6 billion a new series B round at a $24 billion valuation. Some of his biggest sycophants, like unofficial chief propagandist Omar Qazi, are now pushing the idea that if they don’t decide to give Musk everything he wants, he will go after Tesla’s AI efforts through its newly funded xAI: Tell me you have Stockholm syndrome without telling me you have Stockholm syndrome: This is basically suggesting that shareholders should fold to Musk’s threat. During the litigation over the compensation package, Musk was directly asked if the package being voted down by shareholders would make him leave Tesla and he said no. However, things could have changed since, but the CEO is conveniently not commenting on this now – seemingly preferring to let his sycophants spread the fear that he would leave Tesla if they don’t vote for his pay package again. I have a hard time believing that Elon would leave Tesla if the package doesn’t go through. That would be giving up and that’s not his type. Also, I haven’t seen many Tesla shareholders argue that he shouldn’t get paid. I think the vast majority of shareholders agree that Elon should get paid, but they want Tesla to address the clear governance issues that led the package to be revoked in the first place and that re now more evident than ever as the board is letting the CEO openly making threats to shareholders. In my opinion, Tesla needs stronger governance because Elon simply doesn’t have the right temperament to lead a public company. Like Leo Koguan, Tesla’s largest retail investor, said, . We are now seeing the repercussions with the threats, the way he fired the entire Supercharger teams to set an example to other execs, and this pay package being rescinded. and subscribe to the .

        "description": "Nurses are better off after a pay equity settlement.",
        "content": "By Susan Edmunds of RNZ Police and teachers are being paid their lowest rates compared with the minimum or average wage in at least 20 years. Infometrics economists crunched the numbers on pay for teachers, nurses and police. Chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan this year had noted MPs were being paid their lowest salary compared with the average wage since the 1970s, before their latest pay increase. The data shows all three sectors’ pay was comparatively lower on a range of measures too. “Compared to historical norms, police pay looks particularly poor, and teachers don’t look that good either,” Kiernan said. “Nurses don’t appear to be quite so bad, although the recent figures are inflated by the pay equity settlement. If you exclude that from the figures, on the basis that nurses were previously being underpaid because it was a female-dominated profession, then their pay isn’t great either.” For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 — the lowest level since 2007, compared with CPI. Compared with average wages, it was at the lowest point of any time since 2003, and possibly since 1969. It was 41 per cent lower than the high point in 1981. Compared with the minimum wage, it was lower than at any time since 2003, and possibly since 1967. It was 63 per cent lower than in 1981. Police officers are involved in a pay dispute, but were expected to have a new pay offer confirmed by the end of August. Kiernan said secondary school teachers’ income relative to the CPI was the lowest in June last year — shortly before their latest pay increase — since 2006. The Post-Primary Teachers’ Association (PPTA) said most of its members were paid at the top of the pay scale, which was $99,216 a year, going up to $103,085 in December. “Over the longer term, teachers’ pay has been reasonably stable compared to the CPI, and the pay increase set to come into effect from December this year should push inflation-adjusted pay up to a level that is higher than was seen at any time between December 1986 and June 2020,” Kiernan said. “That outcome sounds great for teachers, but if we compare teachers’ pay to either the average wage or the minimum wage, it’s a different story. In June 2023, teachers’ pay relative to either of these variables was at its lowest on record, since 1980. Even with the subsequent pay increases that have occurred and/or will occur in December this year, teachers’ pay relative to the average wage or the minimum wage will still be lower than at any time before June 2019.” He said the teacher pay situation could be leading to wider problems. “New Zealand’s poor educational outcomes and persistently poor productivity results, in combination with pay rates that are continuing to decline relative to other wages and salary, potentially become something of a chicken-and-egg problem. “One can’t expect good educational outcomes without good teachers, but good people won’t be attracted to the profession or retained as teachers without good pay either — and primary and secondary education doesn’t seem to be an area where investment in capital equipment, automation, or economies of scale are going to make a significant positive impact. Of course, there are other big issues as well such as the curriculum, assessment methods, and the incentives to teach to the median student’s ability rather than taking a more tailored approach to student needs.” Kiernan said before the pay equity boost that started in 2021, nurses’ pay was at its lowest level compared with the minimum wage in all the available data. “The pay equity boost pushed nurses’ pay in 2022 up to its highest level, relative to the average wage, on record. However, relative to the minimum wage, it was only at its highest level since 2016.” The nurse pay cited was $75,773. “I wonder whether one of the key aspects of each of these professions is that there is limited scope for improved labour productivity and/or greater capital intensiveness,” Kiernan said. “At its simplest, a teacher can only achieve significant ‘productivity’ improvements by having more students per class; a nurse by having more patients under their care; a police officer by covering a wider area. I can think of how technological advances might have made some of these changes possible — electronic monitoring of patients would require less human supervision of patients in hospital, for example. “But my impression is that the advances will have been more constrained than across many other occupations where computers have had a significant effect on people’s output over the last 40 years,” he said. “As a result, average wages at an economy-wide level might have been able to lift faster because people have been more productive, and the mix of jobs in the economy has also changed towards higher-skilled and higher-paid ones. This trend might have meant that specific occupations with a high human element to them have been left behind a bit, relatively speaking, in terms of their pay rates. “It’s a difficult situation because, as we saw during Covid-19 , people seem to implicitly value the human nature of those roles when the going gets tough — but the pay rates don’t necessarily reflect that.” Share this article",

California lawmakers voted to approve two identical bills which would restrict grocery stores from offering thicker, \"reusable\" bags made out of plastic film to customers. (Jeff Greenberg / Contributor) BLUE STATE’S BAG BAN MEANT TO PROTECT ENVIRONMENT BACKFIRES AT STAGGERING RATE: STUDY SB 1053 and AB 2236 would permit grocery stores to sell other types of reusable bags made of cloth, woven textile or other washable textile that can carry at least 22 pounds for at least 300 uses. It also allows for paper bags with at least 50% recycled paper content to be sold for at least 10 cents apiece to customers. California implemented a ban on single-use plastic bags in 2016, but the law included an exception that allowed retailers to use plastic bags with a slightly thicker film coating, able to have more than 125 uses and carry a weight of up to 22 pounds over a distance of 175 feet. However, the move to reduce plastic pollution failed, as customers treated the thicker \"reusable\" plastic bags as disposable. California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) reported a roughly 47% jump in plastic bag waste tonnage since 2014, despite the ban on single-use shopping bags. CalRecycle has observed a roughly 47% jump in plastic bag waste tonnage since 2014, despite the ban on single-use shopping bags. (Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"California’s current bag ban law, which allows businesses to replace thin plastic bags with supposedly reusable ones at checkout, clearly is not working,\" Jenn Engstrom, state director of CALPIRG, said in a statement on Tuesday . \"Plastic companies mass-producing thicker bags circumvent the law’s intent,\" she continued. \"Then, inevitably, discarded bags pollute our communities and environment. We’re thankful the state legislature is taking action to finally ban plastic grocery bags once and for all.\" The bills will be reconciled between the houses and then sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. If signed, the reusable plastic bag ban would go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Teny Sahakian is an Associate Producer/Writer for Fox News. Follow Teny on Twitter at @tenysahakian.",

It was Springer's fourth homer of the season. Bichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center. Nastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four. Last-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history. Gavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base.",

We know that not everything goes quite to plan as, later, the Captain is in prison, having been captured by his own side – his real side, not his fake side, though the boundaries do become increasingly blurred. In captivity, he is repeatedly told to report everything that has happened to him. As he writes it all down, again and again, details and memories and decisions shape-shift and are reinforced or remade. A draft is rejected for having a Hollywood ending. What story is he supposed to tell? The unreliable narrator isn’t so much introduced as sprinkled all over the series with a flamboyant flourish. Early on, a scene is rewound and replayed, with Downey Jr delivering the same line in a slightly different register. Memory is unreliable, and we cannot fully trust what we are seeing. This is stuffed with stylistic tics and the visual flair you’d expect from a director who is known for it. Images repeat themselves, becoming bookmarks in memories. A man’s head turns into an egg wearing glasses, which foreshadows a gruesome death. Scenes are cut abruptly and aggressively between locations and time periods. You might not want to know what happens to the squid until you’re right there in the moment, hearing all about it. It begins in Vietnam, where, before Saigon falls, we see the duality of the Captain’s life there, as he tracks and interrogates spies with whom he is also collaborating. After an off-the-books flight out, set up by the CIA in order to allow the General to flee the country, the action moves to Los Angeles, while darting back and forth and all over the place, in time and location. The old-fashioned spycraft provides lots of old-fashioned fun. There are miniature cameras, there’s invisible ink made from household items, a secret code used to send messages back home. There are elements of war, particularly in the harrowing escape from the airfields near Saigon, and this is all perked up with moments of wit and levity. In the US, the Captain, who had been a postgraduate in the US 10 years earlier, returns to university and meets Sandra Oh’s Sofia, who rivals Downey Jr for big-star charisma, and with whom he has a steamy affair. It expands into postcolonial theory and academia, dips into a parodic take on an Apocalypse Now-style Hollywood blockbuster, and generally feels like big and ambitious storytelling that is able to balance its tonal lurches well. It is often darkly funny, often gravely serious, violent, emotional and even silly, and it poses grand questions and leaves them to linger, uncomfortably, without serving you the answers on a plate. The only downside to all this is that, on occasion, it feels like it has blown all of its emotional budget on style rather than substance. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that – it’s a good-looking show, performed brilliantly, and it is fantastically ambitious – but sometimes that leaves it having to explain what’s happening with a poetic voiceover, rather than letting it play out seamlessly, for example. You can see this in the Robert Downey Jr conceit, which I admit I found distracting, as good as he is in the roles. For the most part, though, The Sympathizer is exciting, meaty and a reminder that drama that demands your full and complete attention can be well worth the effort. The Sympathizer is on Sky Atlantic and Now.",

BEIRUT (AP) — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world’s attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and most recently Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. At last year’s conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion, just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria, killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year’s amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year’s pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have struggled with shrinking budgets, and humanitarian officials have decried the budget cuts that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged “safe zones” in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don’t exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have called for the reassessment of conditions in Syria to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. “The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,” Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. “If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,” he added. “Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.” Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "BEIRUT (AP) — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world’s attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the and Sudan, and most recently in Gaza. At last year’s conference, , just months after a 7.8 magnitude , killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year’s amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year’s pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have , and humanitarian that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged “safe zones” in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don’t exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. “The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,” Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. “If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,” he added. “Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.” Kareem Chehayeb, The Associated Press",

The water rate hike includes a 20 percent increase the second year, then the hike drops to 13 percent in year three. Wastewater rates will increase 18 percent in the first two years and 15 percent by year three.

Officials are concerned about the looming elimination of the Potter Valley Project's dams, which would impact flow along the Russian River, the second-largest river in the nine-county Greater San Francisco Bay Area. \"We would see more often the curtailment of our water rights along the Russian River,\" Crowley said to the City Council during a meeting on March 28, as reported by the . With the increased revenue, the city will also aim to fix existing wells and increase the amount of water it can secure via purchase from the Sonoma Water transmission system.

He said that as Lagos rises, a future filled with abundant opportunities is unfolding and children should continue to dream big, strive for their goals, and they will surpass their imagination. “As Lagos rises, a future filled with abundant opportunities is unfolding. Continue to dream big, strive for your goals, and you will surpass your imagination. We will always advocate for your growth and ensure no child is left behind.” The Governor pointed out that the government is committed to helping the children develop skills for their future and providing paths to success based on what they are good at. According to him, “Our work is ongoing, and we are committed to giving you the tools and knowledge you need to succeed.” Sanwo-Olu, while acknowledging the roles of the private sector in his administration, stressed that these partnerships have helped the state ensure that the children get the best. He specifically acknowledged companies like Nigerdock and Port and Terminal Multiservices Limited who have generously donated classrooms and other resources to schools in the state. Speaking further, he noted that to help more children go to school, the government has added nine new schools in busy and remote areas. These new schools, according to the him, now have 4,588 students, with 2,310 girls and 2,278 boys, with additional improvement in many existing schools, where over 1,500 projects that include building, renovating, and providing new furniture.

While commending the teachers for mentoring the children, he stated that they are indeed nation builders and salute their commitment, diligence, and dedication. He, also, commended the parents/guardians for always being a good role model to their children.

        "content": "Training a dog requires consistency and patience. But even with endless dedication to training, one owner recently showed in a TikTok video that it doesn't always work out the way you hoped. shared in an April 8 video the results of his six months of \"intense training\" with his dog. All seemed fine to start. His black Labrador retriever sat in front of him while they were on a walk, listening and looking at him intensely. The owner slowly backed away from his dog and asked it to \"wait\"—a common owners often teach their canines to stay in a designated spot—and showed how six months of training can go down the drain. Instead of listening and staying in one spot, the pup was off as soon as its owner stepped back. The dog didn't just move from the spot—it bolted. When the owner realized what was happening, he flipped the camera to show his dog running off. The dog was clearly done with trying to please his owner and instead wanted to continue on his adventure in the great outdoors. One can't blame the dog for losing focus. The American Kennel Club states that dogs will have problems executing tricks that they do not enjoy or if they see no purpose. Since owners cannot make \"stay\" exciting for a dog, they can instead stress the importance of the trick. reached out to @kevinpickles81 via TikTok for comment. The video left viewers in stitches, as plenty have been put in the same position, hoping the training worked only to be let down. As of Monday, the clip had amassed over 487,900 views, 46,400 likes, and 863 comments since being posted early last month. One TikTok user commented: \"My black Lab only listens when nobody else is around. I'm fully convinced he loves making a fool of me.\" \"I have a brown Lab. I swear he can flip me the finger when I tell him to do something,\" said another viewer. \"Me: watching this hoping for some tips. Also me: oh we're in the same boat,\" one comment reads, with a TikToker joking, \"Ahh you've been to the same training school as us.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "description": "A developer has proposed a 56-apartment complex at 519 Fourth St. that would include 28 dwellings for formerly homeless residents.",
        "content": "An affordable-housing developer is proposing to construct a six-story complex with 56 apartments on a city-owned lot in downtown San Rafael. Half of the dwellings would be reserved as supportive housing for formerly homeless residents, according to the preliminary application from Abode Housing Development. The quarter-acre site at 519 Fourth St. between Irwin Street and Grand Avenue is developed with an L-shaped building that is used for storage by the city’s police and fire departments. City officials want to declare the property as surplus, and by law must prioritize its use for affordable housing development before seeking to sell or lease the land for another purpose. Abode’s application was submitted in response to the city’s solicitation. Last week, the City Council authorized staffers to begin negotiating an agreement with the developer and to declare the property as surplus, enabling the potential development to proceed. Mayor Kate Colin said it is a unique opportunity for the city. “With few sites available, transforming this city-owned warehouse into affordable housing aligns with the City Council’s ambitious affordable housing goals,” Colin said. “We look forward to partnering with Abode, whose experience and commitment to community engagement make them the right partner to bring this project to fruition.” Abode is a nonprofit organization in Fremont that has completed affordable housing complexes with portions of residences reserved for formerly homeless people in Fremont, Santa Clara and Hayward. The developer was selected from a pool of three applicants. The others were Satellite Affordable Housing Associates in Berkeley and the Urban Coalition in Desert Hot Springs. “This project utilizes a key city property near our future transit center and demonstrates the City’s commitment to creating homes for low-income residents in the City,” Chris Hess, assistant director of community development, said in an email. “Partnering with Abode, with its vast experience working with neighborhoods and communities, ensures we’ll deliver significant public value and create a lasting community resource.” The city began soliciting plans in December. In its request for proposals, officials stated that the site is being evaluated as a possible location for a temporary shelter for people experiencing homelessness. “If development timelines permit, the City may seek an interim use as a temporary shelter for unhoused residents,” the document states. The city recently received nearly $6 million in grant funding to assist in its effort to house homeless residents. In an email, John Stefanski, assistant city manager, said staffers are still considering sites for a temporary shelter, a project that would be supporting by the grant. The city has not asked Abode to commit to any interim use, he said. Any such interim use would be negotiated as part of the disposition and development agreement, or DDA, he said. “Whether the land is sold, donated, or leased to the developer will be negotiated as a part of the DDA,” Stefanski said. In its preliminary application, Abode states that the project would provide 55 households. One apartment would be reserved for an on-site manager. Abode proposes on-site supportive services with a full-time equivalent resident services coordinator and a part-time program manager. Although not all homes will be reserved for formerly homeless people, the services will be available to all residents, Abode says in its application. As for the affordability of the homes, 29 apartments will be restricted for households with 20% to 30% of the area-median income. Fourteen will be reserved at 50% AMI, and 12 at 60% AMI. Given the affordability levels, the project would be exempt from provisions of the state of California’s Surplus Land Act, relieving some of the procedural requirements and making it easier to build. Bronwyn Hogan, spokesperson for Abode, said the organization is excited about the opportunity to expand its presence into Marin County. “We prefer to partner with cities that recognize the need for homes that are affordable to low-income households, and who want to work creatively with Abode Housing Development to deliver high-quality homes that meet the needs of the community,” Hogan said. “We believe that the city of San Rafael is such a partner, and we look forward to working closely with city representatives over the next few years as we develop this city-owned property on Fourth Street.” Predevelopment expenses related to the housing project are estimated to be approximately $70,000 in legal fees, title and transaction expenses, background documentation and consultants, according to the city.

        "content": "XINHUA – Thailand’s employment edged down in the first quarter of this year due to a drop in agricultural jobs, the country’s economic planning agency said yesterday. The Southeast Asian country’s labour force amounted to 39.6 million individuals in the January-March period, representing a 0.1 per cent year-on-year decrease, easing from 1.7-per-cent growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). The slight decline was attributed to a contraction of more than 5.7 per cent year-on-year in agricultural employment during the off-season, while non-farm jobs grew 2.2 per cent, driven by a rebound in tourism, the NESDC said in a statement. Employment in the hotel and restaurant sector expanded 10.6 per cent from a year earlier, thanks to over 9.3 million foreign tourist arrivals in the first three months of 2024, the agency said. The country’s unemployment rate was registered at 1.01 per cent in the March quarter, up from 0.81 per cent in the previous three months, according to the NESDC.",

        "content": "BEIRUT — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world's attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and most recently Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. At last year's conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion, just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria, killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year's amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year's pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have struggled with shrinking budgets, and humanitarian officials have decried the budget cuts that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country's pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged ''safe zones'' in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don't exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have called for the reassessment of conditions in Syria to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. ''The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,\" Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. ''If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,\" he added. \"Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.''",

        "content": "JUMP down the rabbit hole of brainteasers with this rabbit-themed illusion. Put your observation skills to the test and see if you can find the odd one out in this bunny -filled puzzle . But here is the catch, you have just 20 seconds to spot the unique rabbit in the crowd. At first, you might feel overwhelmed, but take a closer look and you’ll notice one rabbit that stands out from the rest. The brainteaser features 29 cheerful bunnies, all with similar ears, faces, and bellies. Some bunnies are wearing top hats, others are holding things like apples and carrots, and a few even have distinctive fur patterns. However, there’s one rabbit that doesn’t match any other in the picture. Many social media users were left stumped trying to figure out which one of the rabbits was different, while others were simply too distracted by their cuteness to play. But out of the 14 pairs, one lonely rabbit just slightly separates itself from the rest, creating a tough challenge for this illusion. If you couldn't figure it out, here is some help. The rabbit that is not like the others is towards the bottom right of the picture. Still can't get it? the bunny you're looking for is in the fourth row, the fifth one from the left, or second to last in that row. It may be hard to tell, but this bunny rocks a darker yellow pattern on its ears and around its nose, making it difficult to spot. If you're looking for more challenging brainteasers, check out this one where you have to find the differences between the two photos of crowded parking lots. You have a little under one minute to put your attention skills to the test, and spot all ten differences. Another one , created by Bingo company, PlayOJO , tests a player's IQ and vision with an airport-themed brainteaser. Players are looking at a picture of a bustling airport, where you can easily see taxis, buses, planes, and vehicles all around. However, within the crowd of people, there is an important person missing from the plane - the pilot. With the hustle and bustle of the airport present on the scene, it's almost impossible to find him in the chaos. In fact, 76% of people were not able to solve this puzzle, according to PlayOJO. However, if you can crack this challenging puzzle within 10 seconds or less, as well as the others, it could prove that your IQ is much higher than the average person's. Researchers have developed many tests to show how various brain regions react to brainteasers and optical illusions. There are many benefits.",

        "content": "Bob Dylan guitarist Robbie Robertson's kids sue his widow for 'elder abuse' in ugly spat over inheritance The adult kids of Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, It names Janet Zuccarini, Robertson's 58-year-old widow, as the sole defendant She wed Robertson months before his August death, making him sign a prenup By Alex Hammer For Dailymail.Com Published: 17:08 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:12 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The children of a late guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s have sued his widow over allegations of alleged elder abuse. The adult offspring of the renowned Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Janet Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant. She wed Robertson months before his death this past August at age 80, and now the late musician's kid claims she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, especially when it came to the ownership of a Beverly Hills 'trophy home'. That residence once belonged to the producer of Little Shop of Horrors David Geffen, and was purchased by the pair based on an agreement that they would share ownership of the home equally However, the lawsuit claims Robertson - one the founding members of famed Americana group The Band - covered the $1.8 million down payment in full, and cites how within two years, Xuccarini allegedly convinced him to elope. The children of Robbie Robertson, a renowned guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s before dying last year, have sued his widow - 58-year-old Janet Zuccarini (seen with the guitarist in 2019) over allegations of 'elder abuse' Delphine, Alexandra and Sebastian Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant This, the suit states, happened in a private ceremony 'kept secret' from the artist's kids, while Robertson's health and mental capacity was in decline. Prior to the 2023 wedding, Zuccarini, 58, allegedly had Robertson sign a prenup, as well an amended Tenant In Common agreement that stated if one of them died, the estate of the deceased would continue to pay half of the mortgage. This left the guitarist's estate and trust, Adriane Hibbert and David Jackel, on the hook, and led them to wage the current case against Zuccarini. Robertson's three kids, fellow musician Sebastian, Delphine, and Alexandra, are now part of the suit, which alleges Zuccarini financially abused their father to inherit part of his estate. 'A great time for marriage,' the suit states of Zuccarini's alleged mindset at the time, arranging a private wedding away from the musician's family in March 2023 She then had Robertson, who played with The Band from their inception until 1978, sign the prenuptial agreement, knowing he 'was no longer able to read and would not comprehend the true import of what he was signing.' She then saw an 'opportunity to embark on a marriage with a sick and dying man,' before getting Robinson to spend some $175,957 on renovations and $3,381.31 on 'furniture and furnishings' on the Beverly Hills three-bedroom. A five-time Grammy nominee who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Robbie is seen here shredding with Dylan back in 1972, before he went on to become one of the founding members of The Band The suit centers around the pair's purchase of this Beverly Hills home, which they said was Zuccarini's handiwork. The home was bought less than two years before Zuccarini wed Robertson in March 2023, a ceremony held months before his death this past August The late musician's kids claim she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, unbeknownst to them, old friends like Dylan, and the guitarist's ex-wife Dominique Bourgeois. The trio are seen together in 2022 The suit slams this as 'financial elder abuse' and 'tortious interference with inheritance', citing how Zuccarini pursued the prenup and wedding in secret so that neither they nor his ex-wife, Dominique Bourgeois, would 'be able to review' it. They claim they only learned about the marriage - allegedly only attended by Zuccarini's sister and brother-in-law - hours after it happened, showing up to the new house for what they assumed was an anniversary party. The trio went on to discern it was a wedding party, after which Robertson’s children said they were told, straight from their father, that 'nothing in his estate plan had changed'. They were further told that they would 'receive all of his property upon death' - a promise that did not pan out following the five-time Grammy nominee's death. The suit, which seeks to cancel the amended Tenancy In Common agreement while also seeking unspecified damages, is currently grinding its way through the California courts. Robertson, who had a professional and personal bond with Dylan that stretched back more than half a century, died of complications created by pancreatic cancer on August 9. When Dylan controversially went electric in the mid-1960s , it was his The Band that provided his onstage backing. Two days after Robertson's death, Dylan told Billboard : ' This is shocking news. Robbie was a lifelong friend. His passing leaves a vacancy in the world.'

(AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday, a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia.

        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players' parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers' practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything's good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It's not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn't matter; the Rangers' Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers' Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we're trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It's not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final.

        "description": "The new bike and ski shop is located on Grand Avenue in Duluth, near the paved Willard Munger State Trail and nearby Spirit Mountain.",
        "content": "DULUTH — Ski Hut Adventure Center was bustling with activity throughout its grand opening weekend, which began with a ribbon-cutting event on Friday. The new ski and bike shop is located directly across from the Spirit Mountain Grand Avenue Chalet. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays through Mondays, and until 7 p.m. through Fridays. According to general manager Logan Nelson, the Adventure Center aims to provide patrons with an elevated experience of Duluth’s outdoor recreational opportunities within close proximity to the trails and slopes. “We have the Munger trail right behind us that goes down to Hinckley,” Nelson said. “Eventually, we’ll have a paved trail (not on the highway) connecting Hinckley to Grand Marais — right through our backyard.” Ski Hut has been owned and operated by the Neustel family since 1955. Three generations of the company began with Wes Neustel, followed by Scott Neustel and now, Dave Neustel has taken the reins. ADVERTISEMENT The flagship store, Ski Hut East at 1032 E. Fourth St., offers more room for backstop items, while the new Grand Avenue location is focused on bike rentals, bike service and retail until winter. Ski Hut’s Spirit Valley location closed in 2020 due to difficulty stocking enough inventory for both stores. It’s where Nelson got his start with the company in 2013. With the new Grand Avenue shop already under construction, the company decided to end its lease for the empty Spirit Valley location. “A lot of people are happy to have us back on this side of town,” Nelson said. The estimated 4,500-square-foot space occupied by the Adventure Center features an open layout with three service kiosks. The shop is operated by a team of eight. It offers various bike gear, clothing, shoes, sunglasses, accessories and equipment. Types of rentals offered at the shop include fat tire bikes, e-bikes, full suspension mountain bikes, electric mountain bikes, kids' bikes and hybrid bikes, as well as skis, snowshoes and snowboards in the winter. “Most of our rental fleets currently are Trek. We also have some Santa Cruz bikes,” Nelson said. “The best-renting bike has been the e-hybrids for the Munger Trail. That’s by far and away the most popular. That’s the largest portion of our fleet right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Pending the installation of nearby kayak launches, the Adventure Center may also get into renting out paddlesports equipment in the future. “If you don't own paddlesports equipment, you probably don't have the roof racks, the cradles, or the carriers that mount all these things to the roof,” Nelson said. “We're looking for that turnkey experience where we can haul it down to the water for you, get you acclimated, put you in a boat and just send you off for the fun part, not the loading and unloading,” he continued. On the opposite end of the building, Burnett Dairy Cheese Store is anticipated to open by late summer, Nelson said. Burnett Dairy Cooperative is based near Grantsburg, Wisconsin. Its cheese products are sold wholesale, online and at two Wisconsin locations. The new Duluth cheese store is roughly 6,000 square feet and will feature seating in a small cafe area. It will also include a liquor store. The two businesses will buy out their respective spaces while sharing an entry and restroom area. There are also several ideas to collaborate in the works, such as picnic baskets as an add-on option to bike rentals. “We’re obviously very excited to get Burnett’s in here,” Nelson said.

        "content": "AFP – German business sentiment stagnated in May after several months of improvement, a survey showed yesterday, denting hopes that Europe’s biggest economy is on course for a strong recovery. The Ifo institute’s closely-watched confidence barometer, based on a survey of around 9,000 companies, came in at 89.3 points. It was the same reading as in April, and lower than a forecast of 90.3 from analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. Prior to May, the survey had risen for three consecutive months, fuelling hopes the economy would stage a strong rebound after shrinking last year as it faced myriad headwinds. Despite the unchanged reading, Ifo president Clemens Fuest struck an upbeat note. “Germany’s economy is working its way out of the crisis step by step,” he said in a statement. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation but expectations improved, the survey showed. It pointed to improvements in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors but the picture in the service sector worsened. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the latest reading represented a “cold shower to optimists”. “It suggests that the bottoming out of the German economy is not yet being followed by a strong recovery,” he said. But Chief Economist at public lender KfW Fritzi Koehler-Geib said there was still a “little more confidence” in German companies than just a few months earlier. “Although the business climate stagnated in May, it remains at a significantly higher level than at the beginning of the year. All in all, the economic trough should be largely over.” The German economy was hit hard after Ukraine’s invasion in 2022 sent energy costs soaring, with the crisis compounded by a manufacturing slowdown and weakness in key trading partners. Recovery hopes had been driven in recent months by a string of improving indicators. The German government also nudged up its 2024 growth forecast last month to 0.3 per cent, from 0.2 per cent previously.",

        "content": "KARIER sebagai pemegang rekor di kemungkinan besar berakhir, Senin (27/5), ketika juara 14 kali itu tersingkir di putaran pertama usai kalah dari . Nadal, yang akan berusia 38 tahun pada 3 Juni, kalah 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), dan 6-3 dari Zverev, yang berperingkat empat dunia. Kekalahan tersebut adalah yang keempat dalam 116 pertandingan yang ia jalani di Roland Garros sejak meraih gelar dalam debutnya pada 2005. Ini adalah pertama kalinya Nadal dikalahkan di Paris di putaran pertama dan akan kembali menimbulkan pertanyaan mengenai masa depannya dalam . -- \"Saya tidak tahu apakah ini terakhir kalinya saya berada di sini, saya tidak yakin 100%, tetapi jika ini yang terakhir maka saya menikmatinya,\" kata Nadal. \"Saat ini perasaan saya sulit digambarkan dengan kata-kata,\" lanjutnya. Terhalang oleh cedera, yang membuatnya hanya tampil empat kali sejak Januari tahun lalu, mantan peringkat satu dunia itu kini berada di peringkat 275 dan menjadi non-unggulan di Paris. Namun, menjelang turnamen Grand Slam itu, Nadal bersikeras untuk menjaga kemungkinan 100% tentang masa depannya dalam olahraga yang telah memberinya 22 gelar Grand Slam itu. Dalam ulangan semifinal 2022, yang dimenangi Nadal ketika Zverev mundur karena cedera ligamen pergelangan kaki, petenis Spanyol itu punya peluang. Ia mematahkan servis pada set kedua dan ketiga, namun pada kedua kesempatan tersebut ia ditepis oleh lawannya yang berusia 27 tahun. Teriakan 'Rafa, Rafa' bergema keras di bawah atap Lapangan Philippe Chatrier yang ditutup rapat karena hujan deras yang menyapu lapangan. Keramaian mereda ketika servis Nadal dipatahkan pada gim pembuka, dan dia menyesali ketidakmampuannya mengonversi dua break point pada gim keempat. Nadal menyelamatkan dua set point pada gim kesembilan namun menyerah pada set pembuka pada menit ke-50 ketika ia melepaskan pukulan forehand yang mengenai net. Nadal melakukan break untuk pertama kalinya dalam pertandingan tersebut untuk memimpin 3-2 pada set kedua tetapi tidak dapat mempertahankan keunggulan, dan menyerahkan break tersebut kembali kepada semifinalis tiga kali Zverev. Sebuah tie-break yang menegangkan mampu ditaklukkan petenis Jerman itu untuk akhirnya mengklaim set kedua. Nadal berusaha keras dengan mematahkan servis dan bertahan untuk kedudukan 2-0 pada set ketiga. Namun, Zverev kembali bangkit untuk menyamakan kedudukan menjadi 2-2 sebelum Nadal yang terus mendapatkan tekanan harus menyelamatkan empat break point pada gim kelima yang berlangsung selama 13 menit agar tetap dapat bersaing. Zverev, yang tenang, segera unggul 4-3, dan pertandingan usai ketika Nadal melepaskan pukulan forehand yang panjang dan melebar. (Ant/Z-1)",

        "description": "Less than one in three schools around the world provide bins for menstrual waste in girls’ bathrooms, a new report from the UN has revealed.The post Less than a third of schools worldwide have sanitary bins in girls’ toilets, new report shows appeared first on Women's Agenda.",
        "content": "Less than one in three schools around the world provide bins for menstrual waste in girls’ bathrooms, a new report from the UN has revealed. Today is Menstrual Hygiene Day, and to underscore the importance of menstrual health and hygiene, the United Nations Children’s Fund ( ) and the World Health Organisation ( ) released their report, . The report highlights some major gaps that exist in menstrual health, especially for school-aged girls in developing countries; there is significantly limited education, information, products, services and facilities that exacerbate the menstrual health gaps. Globally, just two out of five schools (39 per cent) provide education on menstrual health, while less than a third (31 per cent) have menstrual waste bins in bathrooms. In less developed countries, this goes down to just one in five schools providing menstrual waste bins; meanwhile, that figure sits at one in 10 in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions of adolescent girls cannot access adequate water and soap, with girls who attend private and girls-only schools, as well as those living in urban areas, more likely to have access to a private space with water and soap to change menstrual products at school. Studies have also identified the prevalence of widespread stigmas associated with menstruation, with many young people feeling ashamed about it. This shame can impact their attendance at school, and their mental health. Workalem, a 16-year-old student in Ethiopia, said her education was significantly affected not only because of the difficulty in accessing water and a functioning bathroom, but also because of the shame around menstruation she felt. “I used to stay home for up to 7 days and miss classes and exams because of menstruation and the culture of not mentioning menstruation in public,” Workalem said. “The lack of access to menstrual products and school bathrooms with no water were the reasons I missed school.” Education is one of the best ways to improve menstrual health and hygiene, and teachers in schools are the key to this. It is unclear how many teachers are properly trained to educate young people about menstrual hygiene, as there are no national datasets on this. UNICEF and WHO say this highlights a major gap in educational support for menstruation. When Workalem joined her school’s gender club, she developed a much better understanding and awareness of menstruation. Sixteen-year-old Bilen shares a similar confidence about menstruation, thanks to the education she received from her mother, her teacher and herself, reading about it independently. Her school in the Gambella region also provides its students with period products. “I think (menstrual health) is very important for women,” Bilen said. “My friends also use pads, and we see it as a natural thing. I’m not afraid of it, especially knowing I can get pads in school.” UNICEF and WHO’s report also highlights broader gaps in children accessing water, sanitation and hygiene across the globe. There are 447 million children – one in five children globally – who still do not have basic drinking water services at school. About one in five children (427 million) also lack basic sanitation services, while one in three children (646 million) lack basic hygiene services.",

        "content": "Notre Dame (16-1), which won its second title in program history, became the first program to win back-to-back championships in consecutive seasons since Duke repeated in 2014. Only nine teams in history have accomplished the feat. Virginia won in 2019 and again in 2021 after the 2020 season was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Maryland (11-6) was playing in the championship game for the 17th time in program history, trailing only Johns Hopkins with 18. Maryland scored the opening two goals before the Irish answered with five of the last six of the first quarter. The five Irish goals came from five different players — with two assists from Pat Kavanagh. The Irish scored the first five goals of the second quarter to go up 10-3 before Maryland scored an extra-man goal to make it 10-4 at the half. Chris Kavanagh, who was named the most outstanding player, scored three straight in the second quarter for a hat trick in a span of six minutes. Notre Dame had six goals from midfielders in the first half — to help reach double-digit scoring in every game this season. The Irish continued their dominance in the second half, scoring the first four goals to push it to 14-4 when Fisher Finley became the 10th different Notre Dame goal scorer. Grad student Liam Entenmann finished with 16 saves, his 11th double-digit save count of the season. The five goals allowed tied a program record for fewest in an NCAA Tournament game, while the 10-goal margin ranks second for Notre Dame. AP college sports: https://apnews.com/hub/college-sports",

        "description": "Singer, who was friends with the late actor, has previously claimed Fisher’s daughter Billie Lourd partly blames him for her mother’s death",
        "content": "James Blunt has claimed that Carrie Fisher was “mistreating her body” before her death in 2016, due to Star Wars bosses putting “pressure on her to be thin”. The “You’re Beautiful” singer , 50, was discussing his memoir Loosely Based on a Made-Up Story at Hay Festival , when he reminisced about his late friend Fisher, who died suddenly aged 60 in 2016. Blunt and Fisher met through mutual friends in the Noughties and struck up an unlikely bond. He ended up moving into her Los Angeles home – where she and her mother, the actor and singer Debbie Reynolds, also lived – and he recorded his first album, 2004’s Back to Bedlam , while staying there. Blunt has previously revealed he was with the Princess Leia actor the night before she was found unresponsive on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She died days later, and a toxicology report found she had cocaine, heroin, MDMA and methadone in her system. “I was with her the day before she died, when she came down to my house,” he told audiences at Hay. “And she’d been really mistreating her body, and she’d just got the job again of being Princess Leia in a new Star Wars movie. “So she was really on a high and a positive, but they had applied a lot of pressure on her to be thin. She spoke about the difficulties that women have in the industry, how men are allowed to grow old, and women are certainly not in film and TV.\" He added: “And she really put a lot of pressure on herself, started using drugs again and by the time she got on the plane, she had effectively killed herself. “They say it was heart failure of some kind, but she had taken enough drugs to have a really good party.” The Independent has contacted Rian Johnson, who directed the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi , for comment. Lucasfilm has also been contacted. Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in the The Last Jedi shortly before her death. In Blunt’s memoir, he previously wrote about how Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd , “blames” him, in part, for her mother’s death. “Charlie, her best friend, confronted her more directly and told her she needed to quit drugs,” he wrote. “I took a different approach and did them with her, pretending to myself that I would guide her to redemption one day – just not today. As a result, her daughter Billie blames me in part for her death, and no longer speaks to me.” During the talk, Blunt also discussed his treatment by the tabloid press, his phone being hacked, his experience of being a British soldier in Kosovo, and the backlash to his 2004 song “You’re Beautiful”. Fisher was the daughter of a Hollywood power couple, movie star Reynolds and entertainer Eddie Fisher, but achieved her own fame portraying Princess Leia in the cinematic space saga from 1977. Apart from the Star Wars movies, she also appeared in When Harry Met Sally, Drop Dead Fred, and the TV comedy Catastrophe , to name just a few of her screen credits. When Fisher died, Star Wars director Lucas said that he and the actor had been “friends most of our adult lives”. “She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colourful personality that everyone loved,” he said in a statement. “In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess – feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think.” Hay Festival runs from 23 May to 2 June in Hay-on-Wye; hayfestival.com If you or someone you know is suffering from drug addiction, you can seek confidential help and support 24-7 from Frank, by calling 0300 123 6600, texting 82111, sending an email or visiting their website here .

The country’s tra fish export has roared back to growth after a significant drop recorded earlier this year as countries have scaled up their imports, the agency cited insiders. The United States remained the largest buyer, followed by China, Europe and several South American markets, according to the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers. It is forecast that Vietnam’s tra fish export will expand 10 per cent in Q3 with fuel and logistics costs as well as interest rates cooling down.",

        "description": "Bill Walton, the legendary basketball player and sportscaster, has died after a prolonged battle with cancer.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won two NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful career as a colorful sports broadcaster, has died , the NBA announced on Monday . He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer , the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to its only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. That season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988, according to CBS Sports . Before his pro career, Walton earned a legendary status at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for iconic coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a pronounced stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful language, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walton sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his tangent-filled commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. Dave Pasch, who handled play-by-play duties alongside Walton for ESPN and ABC and was often the butt of Walton's jokes, said Monday that the two of them had a \"special friendship.\" \"He used to tell me a lot, he'd take the headset off during a commercial break and just say to me, 'I love you, but don't tell anybody,'\" Pasch said on ESPN. \"Because he just enjoyed the fact that I was a sparring partner and that he could have fun with me and just take shots at me. I knew that it was all part of the game and that, off the air, we had a great friendship.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" He is survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. -- Originally published by CBS News, written by Stephen Smith .

The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk , had previously announced a vague £2billion defensive line to make NATO's eastern flank “impassable to a potential enemy”. However, on Monday, released visualisations show a 434-mile network of concrete anti-tank “hedgehogs” (metal angle beams which lodge under the vehicle), palisades and steel barriers. This would be integrated with earthworks including bunkers, trenches and tank traps along the frontier. Landmines will allegedly only be laid if war appears imminent.

The Ukrainian leader is seeking more military aid from his Western allies as his troops struggle to hold back Russia's invasion forces. On Monday, he visited Spain, which pledged military support worth 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) this year under a security pact between Zelenskiy and the government of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Ukraine has signed a series of such agreements with its Western partners, pledging long-term security assistance in the form of arms supplies and training for Kyiv's forces.

        "content": "A string of powerline thefts and tampering has police appealing for information, and warning that thieves are putting themselves and others at “extreme risk of electrocution”. Over the past 10 days reports of power line thefts have been increasing across Christchurch, including at Disraeli St in Addingto n, Hillview Rd area, Phillips Rd in Phillipstown and Brougham St. There have also been reports as far as West Melton, Halswell, and Marshlands. On multiple occasions, residents have been left without power due to the theft of copper from the lines, police said. Police have informed community control and frontline units on what to look out for. Businesses and locals in the affected neighbourhoods have also been alerted. The offenders leave the power lines dangerous and exposed once they get what they want, police said. On one occasion a set was left broken outside Phillip St preschool. “Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone, including yourself, gets hurt,” said Senior Sergeant Roy Appley. “You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return.” Police are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in identifying those involved. They are urging residents to ring 111 immediately if anyone is seen acting suspiciously around power poles or lines. “If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it,” Appley said. “We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires – do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away.” Share this article",

Mike Morgan was feeding his cattle from a trailer when he was struck. He died on the scene after emergency responders tried to resuscitate him, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said. Morgan's wife, Niki, was approximately 200 feet away from Morgan when the lightning bolt struck and it was strong enough to knock her off her horse, according to a Facebook post from His Cavvy Foundation , a nonprofit helping ranchers with serious medical issues. Morgan's father-in-law was also reportedly near the blast but survived. The strike bowled over around 100 head of cattle that had crowded around the trailer that Morgan was feeding them out of, county coroner George Crocket said. Mike Morgan was killed in a freak lightning strike over the weekend, Jackson County officials revealed Monday Morgan, 51, was a rancher in the town of Walden, Colorado, a tight-knit community outside of Denver Morgan's family was recently able to afford 300 cattle of their own, and it was their dream to own their own animals 'All but the 34 got up,' Crocket added. The lightning bolt struck a pasture outside the town of Rand, which is about 80 miles northwest of Denver, NBC reported. Morgan is survived by his wife Niki and his 17-year-old daughter, Dallas, both of whom are involved in the ranching occupation as well. The His Cavvy Foundation described Morgan and his family as 'an upstanding pillar' in the town of Walden, Colorado. The foundation's post explained that Morgan had always been working on a local ranch, which recently afforded the family the opportunity to purchase 300 pairs. Pairs refer to a cow and her calf. 'Mike’s wife, Niki, has spent all winter calving these pairs out while Mike held down a job at Silver Spur Ranches,' the post said. 'They do what we all do, whatever it takes to make a living, and they do it by doing what we are all passionate about. Ranching...' The His Cavvy Foundation wrote that Morgan's family has donated time, resources and finances to its various causes throughout the years. 'Mike was a loving father and a tender, intentional husband,' the post said. 'We will all miss that big ole smile he always carried.'

        "content": "In XDefiant, it’s not just the primary weapons that you need to pay attention to, but also the secondary options like the D50 that can provide solid damage output when you have to switch. Usually, you won’t be using your sidearm unless you run out of ammo in the middle of a fight, yet this pistol can take out enemies in a matter of seconds thanks to its low recoil and power. However, it needs to be kitted out properly, which is why we have compiled the best loadouts for the D50 in XDefiant.

        "description": "Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada's airline industry.",
        "content": "Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada's airline industry. In a release Monday, the regulator said two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Domestic fares also appear \"relatively high\" and more and more passengers are filing complaints, it said. The backlog of customer complaints about airlines has hit a record high topping 72,000, according to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The bureau's review, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, looks to pave the way for recommendations to government that would \"make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices.\" First announced on May 9, the market study is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Matthew Boswell, the competition commissioner, stressed the importance of the airline industry to residents and the economy. \"Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,\" Boswell said in the release. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines. The latter two made up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet have strengthened their grip on the domestic market over the past year, even as rival Porter Airlines rapidly expands in a bid to become the country's third major airline. Canada's two largest carriers commanded 82 per cent of domestic traffic among national carriers last month versus 74 per cent in April 2023, statistics from aviation data firm Cirium show. The diminishing set of operators coincides with a six per cent decrease in domestic flight volume between April 2023 and this month, though that may be due in part to a renewed focus on international trips. While big cities remain amply served, smaller ones have fewer options, which can also result in higher prices and, when things go awry, stranded passengers. Over the past five years, the Competition Bureau has raised concerns about the merger of Canadian North and First Air and the would-be acquisition of Transat by Air Canada, which scrapped the plan in 2021 amid regulatory hurdles in Europe. The latest study is not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing, the Competition Bureau noted Monday. \"However, if the bureau finds evidence that someone may be doing something against the law, we will investigate and take appropriate action,\" the regulator said. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the review should consider service levels to various parts of the country as well as rules around flight changes by airlines after the ticket was purchased. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada's airline industry. In a release Monday, the regulator said two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Domestic fares also appear \"relatively high\" and more and more passengers are filing complaints, it said. The backlog of customer complaints about airlines has hit a record high topping 72,000, according to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The bureau's review, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, looks to pave the way for recommendations to government that would \"make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices.\" First announced on May 9, the market study is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Matthew Boswell, the competition commissioner, stressed the importance of the airline industry to residents and the economy. \"Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,\" Boswell said in the release. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines. The latter two made up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet have strengthened their grip on the domestic market over the past year, even as rival Porter Airlines rapidly expands in a bid to become the country's third major airline. Canada's two largest carriers commanded 82 per cent of domestic traffic among national carriers last month versus 74 per cent in April 2023, statistics from aviation data firm Cirium show. The diminishing set of operators coincides with a six per cent decrease in domestic flight volume between April 2023 and this month, though that may be due in part to a renewed focus on international trips. While big cities remain amply served, smaller ones have fewer options, which can also result in higher prices and, when things go awry, stranded passengers. Over the past five years, the Competition Bureau has raised concerns about the merger of Canadian North and First Air and the would-be acquisition of Transat by Air Canada, which scrapped the plan in 2021 amid regulatory hurdles in Europe. The latest study is not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing, the Competition Bureau noted Monday. \"However, if the bureau finds evidence that someone may be doing something against the law, we will investigate and take appropriate action,\" the regulator said. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the review should consider service levels to various parts of the country as well as rules around flight changes by airlines after the ticket was purchased. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Monday night (27 May) saw the live semi-finals kick-off, with . And while there are certainly a number of talented acts taking part in this year's series, one comedy duo left fans rather unimpressed. Bikoon, a rather bizarre act that sees a moving bag complete tricks, left fans rather bored, especially when some of the tricks appeared to go wrong. A number of viewers took to X, previously known as Twitter, to share their thoughts. One wrote: \"How much longer has this show got left? They've resorted us to watching a bag attempting to jump through a hoop five times #bgt #BritainsGotTalent.\" \"WTAF have I just watched. Is this meant to be talent. A man and a bag. Was it meant to be funny? It was as appealing as cold custard. Appalling. #BGT #BritainsGotTalent #Bikoon,\" added another. While a third penned: \"Nah why hasnt the judges pressed the buzzers?! Bikoon is awful. Its just a guy in the bag. I could do it. #britainsgottalent #bgt.\" The first live semi-final also saw host return to work two weeks ago. The TV personality, , beamed from ear to ear as he returned to his Britain’s Got Talent presenting duties alongside close pal and co-host Declan Donnelly. Fans at home welcomed 48 year old Ant’s return to work with open arms and many took to X to praise the TV presenter’s appearance on the ITV show. One wrote: \"Simon congratulating Ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him #BGT #Britainsgottalent.\" \"Ant's first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he's happier than ever #BGT,\" added another. While a third penned: \"Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart #bgt.\" The semi-finals have kicked off following reports that next year's edition of the talent show could take a somewhat different format to this series, with - rumoured to be worth around £100 million. They are also reportedly planning to make the series longer. In recent years, the show has run for around six to seven weeks from mid-April to the beginning of June, but the new plan is for BGT to start in February and be on air for three months. This would fill the gap left by the , and the cash injection would be used to make the show bigger and possibly even better than their competitor .",

        "content": "This move entails chartering a new build vessel named AKTORAS, marking a significant milestone in BGT’s shipping portfolio. Established in 1989, BGT plays a pivotal role in providing shipping capacity to NLNG’s operations, cementing NLNG’s position as a key LNG supplier globally. The addition of AKTORAS, leased under a Bareboat Charter arrangement from Capital Gas Limited, signifies a crucial expansion of BGT’s fleet. AKTORAS is equipped with advanced MEGA propulsion systems designed to lower emissions and enhance efficiency. It boasts a capacity of 174,000 m3, with dimensions including a length of 299.6 meters, a breadth (moulded) of 46.40 meters, and a deadweight of 81,194 tons. During the Christening ceremony held at the Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in Mokpo, South Korea, Mrs. Olu Verheijen, Special Adviser to the Nigerian President on Energy, emphasized the vessel’s role in representing Nigeria on the global stage. Verheijen articulated, “This ceremony embodies Bonny Gas Transport Limited and Nigeria LNG Limited’s unwavering commitment to adapting and excelling in the evolving global energy landscape. Their proactive approach to futureproofing their operations underscores the importance of maintaining competitiveness in the dynamic LNG market.” She continued, “By replacing aging steamships with this newly constructed vessel, BGT and NLNG are enhancing their capacity to meet the increasing demands of the LNG market. This milestone reflects Nigeria’s ambition to emerge as a leading economic force in Africa and beyond, demonstrating our commitment to sustainable development and prosperity.” Verheijen concluded by assuring stakeholders of Nigeria’s steadfast dedication to fostering mutually beneficial partnerships and driving progress in the LNG sector.

        "content": "Nigeria’s representative at the ongoing 2024 Basketball Africa League (BAL), Rivers Hoopers BC, achieved the historic feat of reaching their first ever semi-final at the tournament after earning a tough 92-88 victory over former BAL Champions US Monastir of Tunisia in the quarter-final. Rivers Hoopers went into the quarterfinal encounter on the back of consecutive defeats; against US Monastir in the final game of the Sahara Conference, and AS Douanes (Senegal) during the classification round at the BAL Playoffs in Kigali, Rwanda. On the other hand, US Monastir were riding the wave of four straight wins. However, it was the KingsMen, Rivers Hoopers, who started brighter and looked on the front foot until late in the opening quarter, when US Monastir rallied to take a slim one-point advantage as the first quarter ended 21-20 in favour of the Tunisians. Rivers Hoopers increased the intensity in the second quarter and enjoyed a brilliant scoring run to end the quarter 25-19 for a five-point lead at halftime, with the scores at 45-40 in favour of the Hoopers. Both Rivers Hoopers and US Monastir had met on three separate occasions prior to the quarter-final encounter. US Monastir defeated Rivers Hoopers during the maiden edition of the BAL, while both teams recorded one win each from their meetings at this year’s Sahara Conference. The third quarter showed the competitive nature of both teams as they battled for every possession, with Rivers Hoopers edging their Tunisian opponents 23-22 to take a 6-point lead into the fourth quarter, with the scoreboard reading 68-62 in favour of the KingsMen. A tense fourth quarter saw US Monastir edge Rivers Hoopers by two points, with scores of 26–24 in favour of the Tunisians. But it was the Hoopers who roared loudest at the final buzzer as they held on for a nervy 4-point win, as the final result stood at 92-88 in favour of the KingsMen. Will Perry, who played every second of the contest, was named the game’s top performer as he put up a game-high 33 points along with 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 steals. Three players hit double-doubles for the Rivers Hoopers, as Kelvin Amayo finished with 18 points and 10 assists, Peter Olisemeka had 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Devine Eke put up 16 points and 12 rebounds. The result means Rivers Hoopers are the first Nigerian side to reach the last four at Africa’s biggest club basketball championship. Up next for the KingsMen is a date with Libya’s Al Ahly for a place in the championship game. The game will take place on Wednesday, May 29, 2024 at the BK Arena, Kigali, Rwanda.",

Addressing a press conference in Benin, members of the royal family including descendants of Oba Ovonramwen, Oba Eweka, Oba Akenzua II, Oba Erediauwa and others said, Professor Akenzua against all entreaties have chosen to challenge the Benin Traditional Institution through his acts “that are utterly at variance with the customs and tradition of the Benin people, and the core values of the Benin Royal Family.” When contacted for his reaction, Professor Akenzua said he was in Lagos “for an engagement” and requested time to respond. Reading from a press statement on behalf of the royal family, Prince George Eweka said “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua, has betrayed the core values of respect for the Benin Customs and Tradition, devotion and submission to the customary hierarchy of the Benin Kingdom; and respect for customary arbitration process. Instead, he has chosen the path of rebellion; “For the avoidance of doubt, the Royal Family wishes to emphasize that His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin occupies a unique position as the father of every member of the Benin Royal Family irrespective of age. “Hence the Royal family does not have an Okaegbe, like other families in Benin Kingdom but Odion Egbe who is required by tradition to defer to His Royal Majesty; “The Royal Family also notes that in utter violation of the hierarchy of succession to the Odion-Egbe position of the Benin Royal Family, Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has been parading himself as the Odion-Egbe of the Royal Family, and has held meetings to assert himself as such when he knows that he is not rightfully entitled to the position being far lower in the hierarchy of seniority in the Benin Royal Family; “The Benin Royal Family has given ample opportunities to Prof.Gregory Idurobo Akenzua to retrace his steps and return to the path of honour and dignity; “Prof. Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has snubbed and rejected the opportunities provided by the Royal Family for him to retrace his wrongful steps. “After a careful review of the facts, the Benin Royal Family has decided as follows: “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is hereby suspended from the Benin Royal Family for his acts of rebellion against the Benin Traditional Institution; “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is no longer to participate in any activity connected with the Benin Royal Family; “All members of the Benin Royal Family are strongly directed not to relate, associate, or engage with Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua for as long as he remains suspended from the Benin Royal Family.”",

        "content": "KEIR Starmer insisted he had plenty of energy for the election trail as Tories branded him “Sir Sleepy”. The Labour chief rubbished claims of weariness as “desperate” — and said he had been working flat out on election plans since January. In Lancing, West Sussex , Sir Keir said: “I’ve had a smile on my face since January 1 because I knew this was an election year. “I’ve wasted nine years in opposition. \"I’ve worked four-and-a-half years to change this Labour Party, and now I’ve got the chance to take that to the country. “So we’re doing that not only with energy, but with a smile, with positivity across our candidates as we go into this election.” Tories coined the “Sir Sleepy” nickname when Starmer, 61, who is 17 years older than PM Rishi Sunak, 44, disappeared from the campaign trail on Sunday. Conservative sources appeared to take issue with his age, adding: “It’s understandable he may be weary. On the claims, Sir Keir said: “They are just so desperate. \"They are rummaging in the toy box.” Starmer also refused to rule out raising tuition fees from £9,000 a year. He said he considered himself a “socialist” despite ditching all 10 of the pledges he made in his bid to replace Jeremy Corbyn .",

Ini merupakan Opini WTP ke-10 berturut-turut yang diperoleh Pemprov Sumut sejak 2015. Menurut Penjabat (Pj) Gubernur Sumut, Hassanudin, Opini WTP merupakan sebuah kewajiban bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk standarisasi laporan keuangan, akuntabilitas, dan kepatuhan pada undang-undang. Dia berharap, ini menjadi budaya bagi Pemprov Sumut dan menjadi motivasi untuk meningkatkan kinerja. \"Ini bukan prestasi, ini merupakan keharusan bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk tanggung jawab kita mengelola uang rakyat. Saya harap ini menjadi budaya di Pemprov Sumut dan meningkatkan motivasi kerja. \" kata Hassanudin, seusai penyerahan Laporan Hasil Pemeriksaan (LHP) RI di Ruang Rapat Paripurna DPRD Sumut, Jalan Imam Bonjol Nomor 5, Medan, Senin (27/5). Hassanudin juga menegaskan, Opini WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras Pemprov Sumut dalam pengelolaan keuangan daerah. Walau begitu, hal yang lebih penting, menurutnya, adalah kehadiran pemerintah di tengah-tengah masyarakat. “WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras kita bersama, namun yang lebih penting lagi adalah bagaimana kita bisa meningkatkan kualitas hidup masyarakat, lewat peningkatan kesehatan, pendidikan, lapangan kerja, infrastruktur dan lainnya,” kata Hassanudin. Anggota V BPK RI Ahmadi Noor Supit mengapresiasi capaian Pemprov Sumut yang berhasil meraih WTP ke-10 berturut-turut. Ahmadi mendorong agar Pemprov Sumut mengambil langkah lebih konkret untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat. “Tidak hanya fokus WTP, tetapi juga meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat terutama stunting, 18,9% masih lebih rendah dari nasional tetapi perlu dikejar hingga 14%, infrastruktur jalan, tuan rumah PON 2024 dan Pilkada serentak,” kata Ahmadi. Dia juga berharap Pemprov Sumut segera menyelesaikan rekomendasi BPK RI untuk LPKD 2023. Sampai saat ini pemprov Sumut telah menyelesaikan 81,72% rekomendasi BPK RI, melebihi target nasional yang sebesar 75%. “Sudah melebihi target nasional 75%, tetapi kita harap segera diselesaikan rekomendasi tersebut agar tidak menjadi beban pada Gubernur selanjutnya,” kata Ahmadi. Hadir pada penyerahan LHP BPK RI ini Ketua DPRD Sumut Sutarto, Auditor Utama Keuangan Negara BPK RI Slamet Kurniawan, Sekda Pemprov Sumut serta Forkopimda Sumut. Hadir juga anggota dewan DPRD Sumut dan seluruh OPD Pemprov Sumut. (S-1)",

        "content": "It’s been a while since Apple let developers provide alternative icons for their apps, so that users can change them whenever they want. However, except for Apple’s Clock and Calendar apps, the system has no animated or interactive icons – but a researcher has found an exploit that enables just that. iOS apps with animated icons that lets developers create animated app icons. More specifically, the exploit uses the system’s official API to provide alternative app icons, but bypasses the requirement for the action to be performed manually by the user. In a typical scenario, iOS requires the user to choose a custom icon in the app – and then the system displays an alert confirming the change. The action of changing an app’s icon is canceled if the system is unable to verify that it was the user who chose another icon or if the confirmation alert is not shown. As a result, there’s no way for an app to change its icon on its own in the background. But by using a private method to call the API, Bostwick was able to set custom icons without requiring confirmation from the user. The researcher also tricked the system into modifying the app’s status check, so that iOS sees the app as active even when it’s running in the background. This allows the app to change the icon automatically in the background whenever it wants. To demonstrate the possibilities, Bostwick combined multiple frames to make animated icons. Although the idea of having all the icons animated is a bit disturbing, the researcher believes it would be nice to let apps show short animations when they receive a notification, for example. Of course, the App Store Review team would probably reject any apps exploiting such a breach. You can watch the full video demonstrating the exploit in action below: iOS 18 to get revamped Home Screen Although there are no rumors about iOS getting animated icons, recent reports suggest that Apple will give the iPhone Home Screen a major overhaul with iOS 18. The company has reportedly been , as well as letting them choose a background color for app icons. iOS 18 will be announced on June 10 during the WWDC 2024 kick-off event.",

The Istanbul side are preparing a €15m bid for the 28-year-old, whose 33 goals this season have put him on the watchlist at a number of clubs.

Galatasaray won the Turkish title on Sunday for the 24th time in the club’s history, when they won 3-1 away to Konyaspor. They finished three points ahead of Fenerbahce. While they scored 92 goals in 38 games, they are eager to strengthen their options in the final third and see Szmodics, who can play in midfield and across the front-line, as a potential addition. Szmodics spoke recently of his Premier League dream, saying: “It’s about getting that opportunity and chance to (play in the top-flight). “But hopefully I’ve shown people who doubted me in the Championship what I can do and that I can make that step up and do it at that level. “We’ll have to see what the future holds.

        "content": "Biking advocacy groups held an event and ride on Saturday aimed at honoring Jonathon Hussing, who was struck and killed by a charter bus at the intersection of Scott Street and MLK Boulevard in Covington in late April. The event also aimed to draw attention to what the organizers viewed as inadequate attention to safety in the region’s road infrastructure, with many arguing that Hussing’s death could have been avoided with better road planning. The aim of the event, said Joe Humpert of Queen City Bike, was not only to help the family of Hussing feel “supported and celebrated” but also “to connect more people to our advocacy community and to build a broader coalition to bring issues of dangerous infrastructure, traffic safety, accessibility for all road users, especially vulnerable road users.” Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) An incident report from Covington Police suggests that the Cavalier Coaches charter bus that struck Hussing at the end of April ran the red light at the intersection of East MLK Boulevard and Scott Street, where the accident occurred. Hussing was later transported to UC Medical Center in Cincinnati, where he died from his injuries. The investigation into Hussing’s death is ongoing, but the initial incident report lays out the events of the accident and cites the methods the police used to determine the bus driver ran through the red light at the intersection, namely video evidence from a street-facing camera at Covington Latin School and cameras within the bus itself. “Video evidence was obtained from the bus and Covington Latin School,” the report reads. “The videos showed that Unit 1 [the bus] traveled for approximately twenty seconds on East Martin Luther King Boulevard until the point of impact. During the entire time, the eastbound traffic light for Unit 1 was red.” The police also interviewed a witness, Newport resident Michelle Gilbert-Nies. She could not attest to the color of the light, but stated that she was yielding to Hussing as he was traversing the cross walk. “It’s supposed to be the safest place in the street to cross, and it wasn’t,” said Kathy Cunningham, president of Queen City Bike. Cunningham, like many at the event, felt that the current infrastructure was set up in such a way that deaths at the intersection became not only possible but likely. “For Jonathan and for the 1000s of people who will be killed in this coming year by drivers or vehicles, we cannot accept the status quo,” Cunningham said. As evidence of this, organizers pointed to other deaths that had occurred at the same intersection, namely Gloria San Miguel , who was killed in a hit-and-run while riding her bike across the 11th Street Bridge in August of 2022. “Gloria lost her life riding safely with the right of way,” said Julia Keister, founder of the Go with Glo Collaborative, which was formed in the wake of San Miguel’s death. “Gloria lost her life on our pavement. Gloria lost her life on the same street as Jonathan. Gloria should be here. Our streets are not safe.” The event organizers proposed several solutions to this problem, including more brightly painted crosswalks, tighter corners at intersections—which they argued slowed traffic—and the installation of safety islands for pedestrians. They distributed flyers with diagrams of these proposals to the attendees. After the organizers’ statements, event attendees mounted their bikes and rode through the city, passing Hussing’s home and hangouts. Later in the ride, they occupied the intersection where Hussing was killed, observing a moment of silence. The ride concluded in Randolph Park, where the organizers held a celebration. Joe Humpert (standing center in green safety vest) speaks while occupying the intersection at Scott Street and MLK Boulevard.

There’s layers and layers of changes that we can ask for from our cities and states, and many of these they can actually accomplish.” “The city of Covington must do something,” Keister said. “The state of Kentucky must do something. Go on and paint the streets brighter. Go on and slow down the traffic. Go on and create the bike lanes. Go on and call your commissioners. Go on and write your state representatives. Go on and speak up at your city hall. Go on and keep riding your bike down your streets. Go on and make the streets a place for our people. Gloria and Jonathan should be here.” SUPPORT LOCAL NEWS DONATE Before you go.... Can you help us make a difference?

        "content": "XINHUA – Cambodia yesterday called on entrepreneurs to use e-commerce platform like China’s Alibaba to sell their products to the international market. Speaking at a seminar on ‘Beyond borders: ringing Cambodian products to the global market through Alibaba.com’, Cambodian Minister of Commerce Cham Nimul said her ministry and the Alibaba Group inked a Memorandum of Understanding to directly sell Cambodian products on the Alibaba e-commerce platform in October 2023. “To date, about 10 Cambodian enterprises have put up their products such as peppercorns, mango jam and bird nest for sale on the e-commerce platform,” she told some 320 participants. “I’d like to encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to market their products on the platform in order to help boost the exports of Cambodian products to China and the global market,” she added. Nimul said Cambodia will launch a national pavilion on the Alibaba.com in September on the sidelines of the 21st China-ASEAN Expo. The minister highlighted that under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement and the Cambodia-China Free Trade Agreement, Cambodia is able to export its products to the fellow RCEP members and China with preferential tariffs. Cambodia exported products worth USD8 billion in the first four months of 2024, up 15.2 per cent from USD6.94 billion over the same period last year, according to the General Department of Customs and Excise’s report.",

        "content": "There's good news and bad news for Helldivers 2 players, although in this case they're basically the same thing. The bad news is that 12 Super Earth scientists at a Dark Fluid Research Facility were, uh, \" spaghettified \" after the volatile material suddenly and without warning collapsed into a \"micro black hole.\" The good news is that this unfortunate incident has some players convinced that the arrival of the Illuminate, the so-far-absent third enemy faction in Helldivers 2, is imminent. We will be talking about leaks and spoilers here, for the record, so stop reading now if you want to avoid such things. We will begin with the incident: Breaking: Casualties Minimized Following \"Unfortunate\" Incident at Dark Fluid Research Facility pic.twitter.com/xpJprf2VuK May 27, 2024 The spaghettifying Dark Fluid is being weaponized by Super Earth scientists for use in the war against the Terminids, and specifically the Terminid Supercolony on the planet Meridia: The briefing for the latest major order says Helldivers will use the substance to \"conduct a targeted strike to permanently end the threat posed by the Supercolony.\" The briefing also reveals where Dark Fluid came from, and this is where things get interesting: \"Dark Fluid is a form of synthesized exotic matter liberated from the Illuminate following the First Galactic War.\" The technologically advanced Illuminate were one of the three enemy factions, along with the Terminid and Automatons, of the original Helldivers, but they've been notably absent from Helldivers 2. It's widely assumed that their return is not a matter of \"if,\" but \"when,\" as various leaks and rumors have suggested that reports of the Illuminate's annihilation at the hands of Super Earth may have been exaggerated. Some of those leaks appear to have been spot-on. One, reported in April by The Gamer , showed a planet—believed to be Meridia—exploding. The original leak has since been deleted , but the same leaker also revealed a \"Dark Fluid Containment Device\" and a \"Dark Fluid Research Station'' objective that some players theorized is connected to the creation of a black hole that results in the planet's destruction. That black hole, so the line of thought goes, is what draws the Illuminate back into the fight. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Meridia, as noted, just happens to be the target of the new Helldivers 2 Major Order: Another leak, posted to Reddit in March, contains multiple Illuminate references, most notably the presence of \"Illuminate energy readings in the area surrounding the singularity created by the Dark Fluid.\" In fine Super Earth fashion, it also seems that history is being rewritten: Rather than being exterminated by Super Earth's superior military might, text in the leak says humanity \"magnanimously allowed the Illuminate to flee the Galaxy. Now they're back. Why? Because they hate peace.\" Whether this new spaghetti incident signals the imminent return of the Illuminate remains to be seen, but it sure looks like Helldivers 2 is following that path. Even without all the supporting evidence (or weird coincidences), developer Arrowhead is clearly building up to something. And there's certainly precedent for good news becoming very, very bad news: The great April 1 victory at Malevelon Creek was immediately followed by a massive invasion of Automaton gunships and walkers , and the \"Termicide'' gas that was going to lead to final victory over the bugs actually made things a whole lot worse . Deploying a new super-weapon that attracts the attention of another implacable intergalactic foe? Yeah, that fits. We may not have to wait too long to find out. The current major order appears to be going well: Angel's Venture is under control, Fenrir III is halfway there, and in roughly an hour Turing has gone from 2.8% liberated to 6.6%—there's still a long way to go, but managed democracy appears to be advancing rapidly. Once that's completed, Meridia—and whatever it may bring—awaits.",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — An industry-first study by global ecommerce accelerator, Pattern, has shown that despite their surging popularity, Australian consumers hold negative views on the quality of the products sold on emerging marketplaces Temu and Shein. The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers’ perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. “Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn’t rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,” said Merline McGregor , General Manager of Pattern Australia. “With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells. This is an area where Amazon leads the sector at 58%, with eBay trailing at 39%, followed by Catch (25%), Kogan (19%) and MyDeal (11%).” Marketplaces attract shoppers as cost-of-living pressures bite As cost-of-living pressures rise, Australian consumers are increasingly turning to marketplaces to research, compare, and purchase. A large majority of Australians shopped on a marketplace in 2023, with a staggering 94% planning to buy from platforms like Amazon, Catch, and eBay over the coming year. “With strained household budgets, marketplaces are attracting an increasing number of shoppers with their easy-to-use price comparison functionalities and sales events. With its globally recognised Prime Day event gaining popularity in Australia , Amazon has become the leading marketplace for value-for-money purchases, attracting 48% shoppers, followed by eBay at 41% and Catch at 27%,” said McGregor. Not only are marketplaces attracting higher volumes of shoppers, but they are more likely to secure high income shoppers in 2024. Today, over 80% of $200K earning households shop on Amazon. Even newer marketplaces like Shein attract high income consumers, with 34% of those in the $160 – $199k household income bracket buying from the platform in the past 12 months. Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon’s Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform’s advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia , 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process – significantly more compared to any other single marketplace. Brands need to be present on platforms with biggest product ranges Just over 60% of Australian shoppers believe Amazon has the widest product range, followed by eBay at 52%. All other platforms lagged – Catch, 20%, Temu, 17%, Kogan 14%, Shein, 11% and MyDeal 8%. Offering the most product variety and options also buys marketplaces the highest web clicks, with Amazon averaging 75.2 million monthly site visits and eBay 50.9 million. “It’s no surprise there’s a direct correlation between marketplaces perceived to have the best product ranges and those platforms, like Amazon, that attract the highest volumes of web traffic. Brands need to be present where their shoppers are. While the larger marketplaces may have more competition, they also have the biggest audiences of potential shoppers to target,” concluded McGregor.

Responses were collected online, and the survey was restricted to adults who had shopped online in the previous 12 months ensuring there was a representative sample of age, gender and location achieved.

        "content": "Australians are being promised new federal measures to protect women from domestic violence after a series of horrific attacks, with leading feminist Anne Summers warning about the growing problem as she joins an expert panel to advise on solutions. In a statement on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese formally announced the panel to conduct a rapid review into best-practice prevention approaches to combat violence against women. The panel will be co-convened by the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence commissioner, Micaela Cronin, the executive director of the Commonwealth Office for Women, Padma Raman, and the secretary of the Department of Social Services, Ray Griggs. Alongside Summers, the panel includes author and educator Jess Hill, University of Melbourne research fellow Zac Seidler, diversity and inclusion consultant Todd Fernando, RMIT Centre for Innovative Justice associate director Elena Campbell and Victoria Police assistant commissioner Leigh Gassner. Speaking to this masthead, Summers said the increase in technology-enabled abuse was “really quite horrific”. Read more here. The clock is ticking for students camped at the Australian National University as a police deadline to vacate the area by noon approaches and those refusing to leave risk further action. Police told the protesters on Monday they could continue to protest but that it had to be at another location. “Your current position is situated within the primary fire evacuation zone for the Kambri precinct,” the police said. “Non-compliance with this direction by 12pm [on Tuesday] may result in further action by ACT Police.” Yesterday, those at the camp said they would hold on as they prepared to spend another night in tents amid chilly temperatures. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the “genocide in Gaza” and cut academic ties with Israel. The escalation at ANU follows news of other camps at the University of Melbourne and Curtin University in Western Australia packing up and going home. AAP Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

        "content": "Pitso Mosimane’s Abha Club could not get the win they needed against last-placed Al Hazm in Monday night’s final round of matches so were relegated from the Saudi Pro League. Abha’s appalling away record continued as they spurned a 1-0 lead from Ahmed Abdu’s 47th-minute opener to concede goals by Muhammed Badamosi (58th) and Mohammed Al Thani (80th) and run out 2-1 losers at Ar-Rass Stadium. The relegation comes as a huge disappointment, especially after Abha put themselves in with an excellent chance of surviving the drop by winning their second-last game on Thursday 2-1 at home against Al-Khaleej. That result saw Abha in 15th place in the 18-team league where the bottom three are relegated, a point above Al-Akhdoud in the relegation zone and needing just a win against Al-Hazm to survive. But Abha’s rollercoaster form and especially their poor record on the road cost them again. Their defeat on Monday night came as Akhdoud managed a 2-0 away win against second-last-placed Al-Tai away from home to leapfrog Abha into 15th place on 33 points and safety. Mosimane’s team ended in 16th place on 32 points, Al-Tai had 31 and Al-Hazm 24. Al-Riyadh also won 2-1 away against Al-Khaleej to remain in safety in 14th place. After some initial success after joining Abha, then in 17th place, in January, Mosimane’s side faced a huge setback with an 8-0 home defeat against second-placed Al-Nassr, inspired by Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick, on April 2. That demoralising result set off a series of other defeats, especially in away matches, that would be followed by Abha bouncing back in home games as they kept their hopes alive. Abha would have had high hopes of reversing that poor away form against the already relegated, last-placed Hazm, but it was not to be. It was Abha’s almost non-existent defence that cost them their place in the Saudi top-flight. In their eight games that followed the Al-Nassr mauling Abha won three matches but lost four, including a 5-0 defeat away against Al-Shabab, 4-0 away loss against Akhdoud and 5-1 away defeat to Al-Ahli. Champions Al-Hilal ended with a 2-1 away win against Al-Wehda to finish on 96 points. Ronaldo's Al-Nassr won 4-2 at home against Al-Ittihad to end in second place on 82 points, 17 above third-placed Al-Ahli (65).",

It was a vinyl copy of Ye's fifth album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The person had autographed \"**** ADIDAS\" and \"YE\" in February when the Grammy winner was on a Paris tour. After the signature, his video went viral leading many offers for the vinyl. This, convinced him, to put on athe auction block Moment in Time. According to TMZ , the starting asking price of the piece is over $500,000. To put things in context, Kanye was having a public meltdown against his former business partner, and the signed copy came at that time. Since Adidas cut ties with the Power rapper in 2022 over his unacceptable behaviour—the relationship between them remains tense. Previously, he lashed out at the German apparel giant for what he claimed were the 350 designs that they were selling. \"Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys. I never made these color ways; I'm not getting paid off of them, and adidas is suing me,\" he ranted on Instagram. He continued, \"As far as the system goes What yall gone do now Take my album down again Freeze my accounts again Threaten people to not work with me again All the new non approved 350's are cooorny.\"",

At the Los Angeles premiere, the Hustlers actress said, \"I think this movie does a good job of showing how AI could go incredibly wrong, and this is how it could go really right.\" In the film, the 54-year-old faces an evil robot hell-bent on destroying the world, and Jennifer's character seeks AI to help stop him. The Netflix star meanwhile shed light on the pitfalls of AI saying the ads \"selling skincare that I know nothing about\" using manipulated photos of her face covered in \"wrinkles,\" adding, \"It's really scary,\" noting, \"Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.\" However, Jennifer said her forthcoming film does a decent job of representing both pros and cons of the tech. \"I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities. These movies that are talking about AI — especially this one — do a really good job of showing both sides.\" Atlas is available on Netflix to stream.",

        "content": "As the world faces an increase in international conflicts, the significance of geopolitics is becoming more apparent with every passing day. The geopolitical location is a crucial source of power for all actors, regardless of their actual strength. This is true with Yemen and the Red Sea, which have emerged as one of the most notable regions in the world. Historically, too, the Red Sea has been a significant trade route, connecting the African continent on its western shores and the Middle East on its east. It is a gateway to the southern tip of Africa, making it a crucial region for maritime trade. The opening of the Suez Canal during the Ottoman Empire further amplified the importance of this region since it resulted in shorter distances and reduced costs. The attempts made by the Houthis in the Red Sea to disrupt trade have garnered attention, but not all states view it as a threat. While the United States and Israel are their primary targets, China and Russia are perceived as powerful and friendly actors by the Houthis. Regarding geopolitics, the most critical issue that comes to mind is transportation in the economic sector of states. With the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict , there was a growing international search for alternative transportation methods for commercial goods, particularly energy resources, which Russia previously monopolized. One of the West's most extensive sanctions tools regarding its support for Ukraine has been the search for this route. This trend has become essential in expanding a state's power capacity and encouraging development, progress and empowerment. International actors are now waging a war through these networks. As seen, especially in recent years, it has become a powerful tool to control and dominate foreign policy, and today, these \"corridor or route wars\" are the main hot spots in the area extending from the Middle East to Europe and from India to Ukraine. In this respect, actors with geopolitical control over transit routes provide significant advantages in terms of national power. This approach is compatible with the realist perspective. Moreover, this issue was also observed in the 2023 Summer G-20 competition; U.S. President Biden attended the summit and announced an \"historic\" economic corridor connecting India, the Middle East and Europe, which some believe is a move against China's Road and Belt Initiative. The corridor facilitates the transportation of energy resources to Europe, and the U.S., Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union signed a Memoranda of Understanding to prepare an \"action plan.\" However, the lack of financial commitment created a new geopolitical challenge at the G-20. The Red Sea is facing attacks that target energy and global maritime transportation. The Houthi paramilitary group has increased attacks on commercial ships of Israeli origin since Nov. 19. Attacks are concentrated in the Horn of Africa and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait in the southwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula. The area is critical for commercial traffic and oil transportation, with the SUMED pipeline carrying crude oil to the north via Egypt, with a capacity of 2.5 million barrels per day. The Red Sea route is also known as a vital shipping link between Europe and Asia, carrying approximately 15% of the world's maritime traffic. The alternative is to go around the southern tip of Africa, which would add about 10 days to a typical container ship voyage, increasing costs and causing delays to customers. Ships that can continue to use the Suez Canal have a competitive advantage over their counterparts. Since February 2022, Russia has been actively seeking to establish an alternative to the West in the international arena. Its focus on Africa is a pivotal part of this strategy. In addition to seeking new partnerships to counter the West's and NATO's self-encirclement policy in the security field, there is a growing discourse on regional and global partnership endeavors and cooperation. The significance of Western powers' withdrawal from African countries cannot be overstated, particularly in the context of the changing dynamics between Africa and Russia . As Western hegemony in Africa wanes, Russian influence is on the ascent. Hence, Yemen and the Red Sea hold significant geopolitical importance for Russia. Russia has two critical policies in this region. Firstly, Russia is fostering deeper relations with Yemen against the West, which benefits the Russian economy. Secondly, Russia has geological allies i.e., the Houthis in Yemen. With the potential support of Russia, the economic power of the West will be indirectly weakened. It is essential to consider that Russia is not involved in or developing deeper relations with Yemen at the moment. Russia's role in the Yemen conflict differs significantly from its role in Syria and Libya. Although Russia has not become militarily involved in the Yemen conflict, it is not entirely out of the mix. On the other hand, Russia and Yemen are growing a deeper relationship. In February 2024, the chairperson of the State Duma met with the prime minister of Yemen to discuss cooperation and regional security. Despite challenges, bilateral trade has increased by 90%, and the visit is expected to boost relations. This serves as a positive indication of the potential for continued growth and success in the relationship between the two countries, even amid challenging developments. In January, airstrikes conducted by British and American forces on Houthi targets raised initial concerns about prolonged conflict, with Russia openly expressing criticism of the actions. In February, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Ahmad Awad bin Mubarak, the prime minister of the internationally recognized government of Yemen, in Moscow. In addition to Russia, China also has an important influence in the region. The biggest indicator of this is the non-aggression policy followed by Houthis toward Russian and Chinese ships. While American and Israeli ships were under attack in the region, the Houthis announced that they would not attack Russian and Chinese ships and that the movements of these ships in the Red Sea were not under threat. The attacks in the region reflect 21st-century power struggles and economic interests. As a result, what matters most in the context of corridor wars is the influence and support that can be created in the region rather than actual physical presence. The reflection of the policies followed by Israel in Gaza under U.S. support is that the West has hit trade security in the Red Sea. Russia creates areas of geopolitical advantage for itself within the shadow of Western sanctions, the result of which is economic gains. On the other hand, the U.S. faces tremendous geopolitical risks and struggles, especially in the Red Sea. Although it seems like a small example, its consequences will be felt much more clearly in the international arena, where corridor wars continue, with its advantages and disadvantages for all actors in the long run.",

        "description": "‘I have already signed the documents that will enable the first French instructors to visit our training centres shortly,’ said Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s top commander.",
        "content": "Ukraine’s top commander on Monday said he had signed paperwork allowing French military instructors to visit Ukrainian training centres soon. “I am pleased to welcome France’s initiative to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian servicemen,” Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Telegram after talks via video link with French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu. “I have already signed the documents that will enable the first French instructors to visit our training centres shortly and familiarise themselves with their infrastructure and personnel,” Syrskyi said. Syrskyi gave no further details but said he believed that France’s determination would encourage other partners to join this “ambitious project”. Ukraine’s Defence Ministry in a “clarification” issued later on X said Kyiv had been expressing interest in a project receiving foreign instructors since February. “As of now, we are still in discussions with France and other countries on this issue,” it said. France’s defence ministry said in a statement: “As already mentioned several times, training on Ukrainian soil is one of the projects discussed since the conference on support for Ukraine convened by the President of the Republic on February 26. “Like all the projects discussed at that time, this track continues to be the subject of work with the Ukrainians, in particular to understand their exact needs.” “We can’t take for granted the foundations on which we have built our European way of living and our role in the world,” the two leaders wrote in a joint op-ed for the Financial Times newspaper. Macron also put his name to Scholz’s idea of a “Zeitenwende”, the word used by the chancellor to describe the historic shift in Germany’s attitude to defence, which has seen it massively boost military spending following the invasion of Ukraine. “Looking back at the challenges over the last five years – be it the pandemic, the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine or increasing geopolitical shifts – it is clear: Europe is experiencing its Zeitenwende,” the leaders wrote. Among the elements put forward by Macron and Scholz were the need to deepen the EU’s single market, and boost investment, while reducing the bloc’s dependence on trading partners for key supplies. The joint mission statement comes after a period of marked tensions between the leaders of the EU’s two biggest powers. The French and German leaders will meet in person on Tuesday in Meseberg, close to Berlin, for a joint Franco-German meeting of ministers on the third day of Macron’s Germany visit. Also on Monday, Russian air defence units downed a drone outside Moscow, said Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov. Vorobyov, writing on Telegram, said fragments from the downed drone landed on a private house at about 9pm local time in Balashikha, just east of the capital. Those inside the house escaped unharmed. The Russian Defence Ministry reported that air defence units had destroyed a “small-scale airborne object”. Tass news agency, quoting aviation services, said aircraft had been temporarily directed away from flight paths northeast of Moscow but airports in the Moscow region were later reported to be operating normally.",

        "content": "As the IDF finally managed to pull out of a tunnel in Jabilaya, a refugee 'camp,' her father has shared how he That image is the now-infamous horrifying image of body on the back of a truck lifeless, topless, and mutilated. The photo shows Shani surrounded by , as they along Gaza streets, jubilant. This photo was the subject of controversy when an AP photographer won 'Photo of the Year,' with it. The photo has been used as an example of the brutal massacre that launched the current Israeli-Hamas war. And to Shani Louk's father, Nissim, that footage is how he finally learned about his . He didn't know where to turn on when he realized his daughter couldn't be reached after attending the Nova festival. Nissim discovered his daughter was at the now infamous Nova rave festival, where 360 other people dancing at a festival were murdered, only when Shani’s ex-boyfriend shared with him a photo of his daughter’s lifeless, half-naked body sprawling face-down on a moving pick-up truck, with armed men crowding around her. \"We didn’t see any blood on that white truck so we thought, maybe she’s OK,\" Nissim said. \"We didn’t know if she was dead or alive, we were trying to figure out how to get the information,” Nissim told The Telegraph. They and inquire about Shani. He recalled: \"That old man was traveling from one hospital to another trying to get a word.\" Then, the worst of the news came. The IDF had discovered a piece of fractured skull that DNA testing linked to Shani Louk. Investigations have since revealed out that she was likely shot and killed quickly before her body was brought to Gaza. Nissim Louk and his family work with other families of hostages, organizing protests and demanding that the government work towards a ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement. Her father also fought back against the controversy around his daughter's photo, explaining that he thought it was important that the horrifying image be seen by as many people as possible. \"I think it's a good thing to use it to inform the future,\" he said. \"If I start crying, what will come of it? This is history. In 100 years, they will look and know what happened here. I travel the world, and everyone knows who Shani is.\" Shani grew up in Israel and could be seen before her abduction dancing happily with other festivalgoers, campaigning for peace and against military service, beliefs she was known for. She last spoke with her parents just hours before Hamas militants ravaged the festival. This month, Israeli officials said Shani’s body was among three recovered in Gaza. Shani, 22, was identified alongside Amit Buskila, 28, and a 56-year-old man, Itzhak Gelerenter. Three days ago, in another Jabilaya tunnel, the body of Shani Louk's boyfriend, Orión Hernández Radoux, 30, was discovered, along with the bodies of Hanan Yablonka, 42, and Michel Nisenbaum. All have now been laid to rest in Israel.",

Research published by LawnStarter ranked the filthiest metros across the country, taking into account factors such as air quality, infrastructure problems, and the number of pests scurrying around in people's homes. Its findings showed Houston, Texas , is now the dirtiest city in the US after overtaking Newark, New Jersey, from last year. Newark, which is across the Hudson River from New York City , still ranked in second place. And while the Big Apple didn't claim the number one spot, it did secure 12th place. Your browser does not support iframes. Houston surpassed Newark as the dirtiest city in 2023, largely due to issues with pollution and cockroach infestations Across the 152 cities that were analyzed, Houston was the third most polluted overall and had the third worst greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial facilities. The city of 2.3 million also has the biggest cockroach problem, according to data LawnStarter' s sister site PestGnome pulled from the Census Bureau. Southern states in general appear to have far more cockroach-infested homes as San Antonio, Texas and Tampa, Florida rounded out the top three. And Americans terrified of mice or rats should steer clear of Boston, Philadelphia or Baltimore, which were the top three cities for rodents to populate in homes. California also had a number of bad showings on the list despite its billions of dollars of spending to clean up homeless shelters over the last five years . By comparison, San Francisco spent a record $72.5 million on street cleaning in 2019 and has been ranked among the cleaner half of cities in the US. Since then, the street cleaning division of the city's Department of Public Works received a $16.7 million budget increase in 2023, CBS reported.

Many other cities in the Golden State have bad air quality from pollution Ontario, California is pictured from overhead. The city is tied with San Bernadino for the worst air quality in the country Riverside, California, also has the worst air quality in the country alongside Ontario and San Bernadino. All three cities are east of Los Angeles and near many factories and warehouses San Bernadino, colloquially known as the ' armpit ' of California among locals, was the fourth dirtiest city mostly because of its poor air quality. Riverside and Ontario, which are also in the Los Angeles metro area, were tied with San Bernardino for the worst air quality in the country. These LA adjacent cities, once filled with orange groves and grape vineyards, have largely been replaced with pollution-heavy warehouses. About 1 billion square feet of warehouse space to be exact, The Verge reported in 2022. Residents of San Bernadino were the most dissatisfied with the cleanliness of their city for the second year in a row, according to data from the study. The LawnStarter study also claimed the southwestern US had problems with drinking water contamination. 'Except for Salt Lake City, every Southwest city we ranked violated the Safe Drinking Water Act at least once in 2020, the year of the most recent EPA data,' according to the study. Las Vegas - the 19th dirtiest overall - had the most unsafe water in the southwest. Las Vegas had the most unsafe water in the southwestern US, according to the study Salt Lake City, Utah, was the only city in the southwest that didn't have major drinking water violations in 2020, per the most recent EPA data Virginia Beach, Virginia was ranked the cleanest city in the US. It was tied with three other cities in California and New Jersey for having the fewest greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities per capita However, the most obvious image that comes to mind when one thinks of a dirty city is littering. Interestingly, the authors of the study claim that Ohioans specifically has a unique habit of flicking their used cigarettes on the ground. Local media in northeast Ohio has picked up on the sheer amount of discarded cigarette butts in the state, with cleveland.com reporting on information campaigns back in 2021 to discourage people from littering. Five Ohio cities that LawnStarter ranked were among localities with the highest share of smokers in the US. Many cities that were close to water in California, Virginia and North Carolina were the cleanest on the list. Virginia Beach, Virginia was ranked the cleanest city in the US, though the study said being on the coast isn't the end all be all to having a metro free of waste. In fact, inland cities such as Fremont, California and Winston-Salem, North Carolina were also among the most immaculate.

This was followed by a 13.8 per cent year-on-year export expansion to USD56.2 billion in April, marking the seventh consecutive monthly increase, largely fuelled by high demand for semiconductors and vehicles. “Exports have been expanding across most regions, including the United States (US), China and the ASEAN bloc,” Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo said during a government meeting reviewing the country’s exports. “The trend is expected to continue in May, with the country posting export growth and a trade surplus.” Over the January-April period, exports to six out of nine major destinations increased, with those to the US rising 17.7 per cent over the period. The ministry attributed the growth to the robust performance of chips, with other major contributors including automobiles, machinery and display products. Cheong added that the government will continue to make efforts to achieve record performance this year. South Korea earlier announced its goal to achieve annual outbound shipments of USD700 billion. South Korea will announce the monthly export performance for May on Saturday.",

Podcast By Adam Shergold Published: 22:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:06, 27 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments Erik ten Hag flew off on his summer holidays on Sunday having guided Manchester United to an unexpected FA Cup win to end a troubled season on a note of optimism. But the Dutchman might be advised to keep his phone switched on with INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe poised to make a decision on his future at Old Trafford. Ten Hag did everything he could to persuade United's part-owners to keep him on for a third season with a tactical masterclass to stun Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. However, INEOS won't judge him on just that one performance - however impressive - and that is where Ten Hag is in serious trouble. It's been a dreadful campaign for United, who finished a lowly eighth in the Premier League - their worst performance since 1990 - and missed out on Europe until Saturday's win.

The FA Cup offered some salvation but it's already public knowledge that INEOS have held talks with four potential replacements for Ten Hag as they audit the season. Read More Erik ten Hag faces an anxious wait to discover whether his FA Cup victory will be enough to save his job at Man United... after club chiefs held talks with potential replacements Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Frank, Roberto De Zerbi and Kieran McKenna are the names in contention and each candidate brings different qualities and pedigree. Mail Sport runs the rule over the advantages and disadvantages of the quartet. Thomas Tuchel The case FOR INEOS are big on things like 'best in class' and 'impressive pedigree' when it comes to key personnel and Tuchel would certainly tick a lot of boxes as they strive to elevate United back to the elite. The German has coached leading clubs Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, achieving some noteworthy success. He guided Chelsea to an unexpected Champions League triumph in 2021 a year after taking Paris Saint-Germain to the final, and has won league titles in France and Germany. Thomas Tuchel is available after leaving Bayern Munich and has a proven track record The German guided Chelsea to an unexpected Champions League triumph back in 2021 United won't be in the Champions League next season but with Tuchel at the helm there would be the feeling they'd soon be back. His CV gives him gravitas because it's a proven track-record of creating winning teams at the highest level of European football. Tuchel is known for his tactical versatility and likes to innovate, which would keep United's players on their toes. But good luck to those who don't carry out his instructions - they'd certainly hear about it. He would instil discipline - as Ten Hag has sought to do - and would have little patience with those who step out of line and cause issues. Sometimes he can overstep the mark, however, as we'll come to. He seems to be the ultimate 'you didn't realise what you had until it's gone' figure. PSG haven't reached another Champions League final since he left, Chelsea have certainly regressed since Todd Boehly dumped him and there were reports Bayern tried to get him to stay after getting rid. Tuchel's vision to take Chelsea forward didn't align with that of the club's new ownership The case AGAINST Bayern's performance this season, as they were blown away by Bayer Leverkusen domestically and chucked away a Champions League final as they lost to Real Madrid, was a blot on the copybook. Read More It would now seem MAD to sack Erik ten Hag: OLIVER HOLT explains why this FA Cup final is different to Louis van Gaal's Wembley last hurrah When things unravel with Tuchel, it tends to happen quickly and often explosively, with a great deal of friction between him and his bosses - and the players. He is a man who needs to get his way, including on transfers, and his vision would need to be perfectly aligned with that of Ratcliffe from the outset. At PSG, he clashed with sporting director Leonardo over recruitment and claimed he 'felt more like a politician than a coach' at the Parc des Princes. Boehly arrived at Chelsea and splashed tens of millions but you wonder how much say Tuchel actually had. It quickly emerged he disagreed with the club's direction in the market and the writing was on the wall. Tuchel can be abrasive if things don't go his way, which causes issues with players and owners His pragmatic approach at Bayern grated with many of the players but he claimed he was forced into conservative tactics because the hierarchy didn't sign his transfer targets. With INEOS assembling a new structure to guide recruitment at United, the potential for friction with Tuchel would be ever-present if he didn't get his way. Mauricio Pochettino The case FOR Read More Mauricio Pochettino has long been overlooked by Man United since his 'dream' lunch with Sir Alex Ferguson in 2016... now, with Erik ten Hag's future hanging by a thread, the Argentine is closing in on his Old Trafford destiny Mauricio Pochettino is a great believer in the 'energy of the universe' and maybe the stars are aligning for him to become Manchester United manager at last. The Argentine has been considered for the job several times in the past, most recently in 2022 when he was overlooked for Ten Hag. Now, following his departure from Chelsea after just one season, he may be able to become ringmaster at another circus straight away. The heartfelt reactions of some Chelsea players to Pochettino's departure gives a measure of the man - he is an easy guy to like and loves nothing more than working with footballers to improve their game. At United, he wouldn't want to stray into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer-style chumminess but after the abrasion of Ten Hag, Pochettino would be like a soothing balm for the dressing room. Mauricio Pochettino walked away from Chelsea last week and could finally get the United job Whether that gets results is another matter entirely, but Pochettino did ultimately emerge from the chaos at Chelsea with his reputation intact. It was a tough situation. After a couple of near-misses at Tottenham, he did gets some trophies on his CV at PSG, although that could be football's equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. The Argentine's man management skills are well-known and admired There's no doubt Pochettino's charisma could be a much-needed galvanising factor at Old Trafford as they embark on the INEOS era and you sense he'd slot in well with Dan Ashworth and Jason Wilcox. He is devoted to playing attractive and attacking football - ticking another box - and his record of bringing through young talents will play well with the United faithful. The case AGAINST The main reservation about Pochettino is that he doesn't have the same proven track record of winning trophies as Tuchel. He may have guided Tottenham to a Champions League final in 2019 but they were well-beaten by Liverpool. His Chelsea team should have beaten Liverpool in this season's Carabao Cup final but ended up losing. Can Pochettino get his teams over the line when it matters? A lot also depends on whether Ratcliffe demands success straight away or is willing to give the next manager time to build United up again. Pochettino would likely need three to four years to get a United team in his image fully firing - would the ownership or the fanbase have that patience? Pochettino took Tottenham to the 2019 Champions League final - but they lost to Liverpool As Ten Hag has found out, all United manager are expected to build for the long-term and show progress, while winning enough games in the here and now. But if that is a genuine concern, then it comes back to the fundamental question of why dispense with Ten Hag two years into his project to rip it up and start again? Thomas Frank The case FOR United have witnessed first-hand just how effective Thomas Frank's Brentford are. Read More EXCLUSIVE Roberto De Zerbi is a surprise candidate for the Man United job if Erik ten Hag is sacked - joining Kieran McKenna, Thomas Frank, Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino on the shortlist Last season, they were thrashed 4-0 in west London in Ten Hag's second game in charge and this season they needed two stoppage time goals from Scott McTominay to beat the Bees at Old Trafford. In the return game at the Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford came back to steal a point even though Mason Mount scored in the 96th minute. Danish coach Frank is rightly respected for the outstanding job he's done at Brentford, guiding them into the Premier League and then keeping them there for three seasons. Brentford play tactically shrewd football and have bloodied the noses of the Premier League's big boys on countless occasions. They may have a modest budget by Premier League standards but Frank, like everyone at Brentford, knows how to work smartly. Thomas Frank has succeeded in establishing Brentford as a Premier League outfit Everything is data-driven and that has led to some clever recruitment with Brentford widely acknowledged to be one of the best-run clubs in English football. All this would definitely appeal to INEOS, who would be interested in any ideas for marginal gains Frank can bring. Frank is a likeable, intelligent and eloquent guy who clearly has an excellent rapport with his players. Also in the frame for the vacant Chelsea job, it seems only a matter of time before Frank gets his chance at a bigger Premier League club. The case AGAINST At 50, Frank is still a relatively young coach but he doesn't have that ready-made experience of coaching one of the bigger clubs - unlike Tuchel and Pochettino. He doesn't have experience of managing the egos of a really elite dressing room and all the problems that come with that. Frank's Bees have stung United before, including with a 4-0 win early last season (pictured) The harmony evident at Brentford would be trickier to replicate at Old Trafford. As David Moyes discovered in 2013, you can have a very good record at a mid-ranking Premier League club like Everton and be well-regarded, but Manchester United are a very different beast. Is Frank ready for the glare of the United spotlight, the brutal scrutiny of his every decision and the sheer global enormity of the club? You just can't know how you'd cope with all that pressure until you're actually there. Kieran McKenna The case FOR Read More Kieran McKenna is a smart man. So why would he get involved in the risky business of the nutters at Man United and Chelsea? Undoubtedly the man of the moment in English football coaching. McKenna has transformed Ipswich Town from a middling League One side to a proud Premier League club again with back-to-back promotions. Since taking charge of his first game at Portman Road in December 2021, no club in the top four tiers of English football have won more league points than Ipswich's 237. Only Manchester City have scored more than their 222 goals. This hasn't gone unnoticed with McKenna linked to Chelsea, United and Brighton in recent days. A return to United would be the romantic choice. The Northern Irishman is a lifelong Red and coached in their academy before serving on the staff for Jose Mourinho and then Solskjaer. Kieran McKenna has guided Ipswich from League One to the Premier League in two seasons The 38-year-old has impressed at Portman Road and has been linked to United and Chelsea McKenna knows how things work at Old Trafford and fully grasps the expectations. Solskjaer described him as 'the most thorough and analytical, step-by-step, process-driven coach that I've worked with' and you can imagine the INEOS panel murmuring in approval. His Ipswich side play eye-catching football and have good collectivism, meaning they finished above clubs with vastly bigger budgets to clinch automatic promotion. In appointing a 38-year-old coach, United's new co-owners may feel they're tapping into a trend of younger coaches who bring fresh ideas, have no baggage and aren't afraid to think outside the box. The case against The obvious argument against McKenna is his lack of top-level experience, even if he knows United inside out. With all due respect to Ipswich, United are a world removed and the pressure could cause such an inexperienced coach to crumble very quickly. McKenna has many years ahead of him in management and though he will have personal ambitions, he'd be well advised not to take the United job now. Given the club is one never-ending soap opera, McKenna could very easily find himself chewed up and spat out within a few months, damaging his reputation. McKenna was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching staff at Old Trafford and knows United There are far safer bets for gaining Premier League experience than United, that's for sure. ROBERTO DE ZERBI The case for Mail Sport revealed on Monday that former Brighton coach De Zerbi is another candidate for the United job should Ten Hag be fired. The Italian, 44, worked wonders at Brighton after replacing Chelsea-bound Graham Potter early last season, guiding them to a sixth-place finish and European football for the first time. United were on the receiving end as Brighton beat Ten Hag's side both home and away in the Premier League, while they needed penalties to squeeze past the Seagulls into the FA Cup final. De Zerbi has emerged as another potential Ten Hag replacement after leaving Brighton This season hasn't been as momentous with Brighton finishing 11th, but they did show their swagger in a 3-1 win at Old Trafford back in September, the kind of result that barely raises an eyebrow nowadays. Despite this, plenty of bigger clubs have come knocking for De Zerbi's services and United would be up against Chelsea and potentially others if they try to hire him. De Zerbi certainly doesn't want for passion - which can be a double-edged sword - but he has proven with Brighton he can mastermind effective and tactically clever football in the Premier League. As Mail Sport reported on Sunday, United would have to pay compensation to Brighton but it's only around £5million. De Zerbi would be like an electric shock around Old Trafford but we don't really know if he's capable of building a long-term project or winning major silverware. Ten Hag's United beat De Zerbi's Brighton 2-0 on the final day of the Premier League season The case against It didn't take too much reading between the lines of De Zerbi's Brighton exit statement to discover the true reasons for his departure. He'd not been shy in criticising Brighton's hierarchy over recruitment and you sense he might be on the same collision course if he came to United. The Italian isn't someone happy to simply leave transfers to a committee, they have to fit his tactical structure. How much power would Ratcliffe, Ashworth and Co be willing to cede? Like Frank and McKenna, De Zerbi is also untested at the very top level of football and offers no guarantees of success, let alone the instant success everyone at United craves.

        "content": "Keir Starmer declares he's 'a socialist who will put country before party' after hitting back at claims of being 'Sir Sleepy' during election campaign By Kumail Jaffer Political Correspondent Published: 22:00 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:04 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Keir Starmer declared he is a 'socialist' yesterday as he hit back at claims of being 'Sir Sleepy' during the election campaign. The Labour leader said the July 4 vote amounted to a choice about 'whose side are you on' as he introduced himself to the nation after four years in opposition. Vowing to deliver economic stability and protect national security 'in service of the British people', he claimed he was 'progressive'. This is despite abandoning several Left-wing pledges he ran on when challenging for the party leadership. Sir Keir, 61, also dismissed accusations from senior Tory sources that he lacked the 'stamina' to handle an election by claiming Labour has been in campaign mode since he became leader in 2020. Keir Starmer declared he is a 'socialist' yesterday as he hit back at claims of being 'Sir Sleepy' during the election campaign At his first keynote speech at Lancing in West Sussex, the Labour leader said the July 4 vote amounted to a choice about 'whose side are you on' as he introduced himself to the nation after four years in opposition In a speech which centred on his personal motivation in politics rather than policy, Sir Keir accused ministers of failing to understand the lives of voters outside major cities In a speech which centred on his personal motivation in politics rather than policy, Sir Keir accused ministers of failing to understand the lives of voters outside major cities. Read More Keir Starmer sets out to woo undecided Middle England as he claims he has 'changed Labour permanently' from party led by Jeremy Corbyn and asks floating voters to trust him with UK's 'money, borders and security' at the next election 'Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question: whose side are you on?' he declared. 'Everything I have fought for has been shaped by my life, every change I have made to this party has been about a cause, the answer to that question, the only answer: the working people of this country delivering on their aspirations, earning their respect, serving their interests.' The de facto campaign launch took place in the West Sussex constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham, where Labour will look to hunt down the Tory majority of 7,474. Separately in an interview with the BBC, when asked if was a socialist, Sir Keir said: 'Yes, I would describe myself as a socialist. I describe myself as a progressive. I'd describe myself as somebody who always puts the country first and party second.' But last night senior Conservatives accused Sir Keir of failing to offer any substance. The de facto campaign launch took place in the West Sussex constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham, where Labour will look to hunt down the Tory majority of 7,474 Starmer has promised to put the country before the Labour party. Pictured at the UEFA Euro 2020 final He said: 'Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question: whose side are you on?' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: 'Not a single plan for the future. Our country needs bold action, not waffle.' Read More Rishi Sunak defends his 'bold' National Service plan for teenagers amid a Tory election campaign row as it is branded 'political suicide' by party members and sparks backlash from minister who says it was 'sprung' on them with no warning Tory chairman Richard Holden added: 'Once again Keir Starmer stood up to tell the country absolutely nothing. In this wearisome and rambling speech, there was no policy, no substance and no plan.' Party figures have been keen to point out that Sir Keir – who is 17 years older than Mr Sunak – may not have what it takes to fight a gruelling six-week campaign. One official even took a lead from Donald Trump's jibes at President Joe Biden and labelled him 'Sir Sleepy'. But Sir Keir said: 'I think they're just so desperate. 'We've had a strategy, we've had a plan that we've worked on for this election for four-and-a-half years. We're executing our plan and our strategy. 'I've had a smile on my face since January 1, 2024 because I knew this was going to be an election year. Responding to the Labour leader, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: 'Not a single plan for the future. Our country needs bold action, not waffle' Tory chairman Richard Holden (pictured) added: 'Once again Keir Starmer stood up to tell the country absolutely nothing. In this wearisome and rambling speech, there was no policy, no substance and no plan' One official even took a lead from Donald Trump's jibes at President Joe Biden and labelled Keir Starmer 'Sir Sleepy' 'So we're doing that not only with energy, but with a smile, with positivity across all of our candidates.' Read More Keir Starmer's pledge to 'fight for Britain': Labour leader to appeal to undecided voters by asking them to trust him with UK's 'money, borders and security' The Prime Minister has distanced himself from such briefings, saying 'the substance is what matters.' Sir Keir also doubled down on his vow not to raise VAT or income tax. He told the BBC: 'Politics is about service for me, and that's why I changed the Labour Party in the service of working people. 'But what I'm doing now is humbly asking voters to trust us to change the country. 'None of our plans require us to increase taxes. Working people have been overburdened with increased taxes. 'We have gone through all of our plans, and none of them require us to raise taxes.' The Labour leader showed rare clarity when asked about previous reports of him backing votes for EU citizens, ruling out the idea completely. But he left the door open for raising tuition fees in future and said the party will review voter ID laws introduced by Boris Johnson in 2022.

The Portuguese superstar was at his brilliant best as he fired the Saudi Arabian hosts into the lead on the stroke of half time before doubling their advantage in the 69th minute. Al-Ittihad, featuring former Chelsea star N'Golo Kante and ex-Liverpool midfielder Fabinho , looked to fight back with two goals near the end of the match but were unable to undo the damage done by Ronaldo and Co. The evening was all about Ronaldo as his outstanding performance saw the 39-year-old continue his usual career trend of breaking new records. Two strikes against Al-Ittihad ensured the former Real Madrid , Man United , and Juventus star would become the new holder for the most goals scored in a single Saudi Pro League season.

The previous record for the most goals scored in a single season was held by Moroccan Abderrazak Hamdallah. Meanwhile, his latest efforts also means Ronaldo is now the first-ever player to be a top scorer in four different leagues. Ronaldo's first top scoring season came in England when his performances at Man United during the club's 2007/08 Champions League winning season saw him awarded the Premier League's golden boot. The Portugal captain matched Alan Shearer's 38-game record that year by finding the back of the net 31 times, before moving to Real Madrid just over a year later. His nine-years in the Spanish capital saw Ronaldo battle back-and-forth with Lionel Messi for the LaLiga top scoring gong, and got the better of the ex-Barcelona star on three occasions. Ronaldo then continued to impress after moving to Juventus, where he won the Italian top scoring honour with 29 goals in 33 Serie A outings.

        "content": "I went to a job interview hoping for the best, but was left absolutely shocked by the hiring manager’s incredibly ‘woke’ act before we had even started Hiring manager performed Welcome to Country at job interview READ MORE: Aboriginal leaders call out constant Welcome to Countries By Olivia Day For Daily Mail Australia Published: 22:04 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:04 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments An Aussie applying for a customer service role at an insurance company was left shocked after the hiring manager opened the interview with a Welcome to Country. The applicant shared the 'weird' experience on Reddit , saying the hiring manager at the Brisbane-based company 'took it upon himself' to perform a Welcome to Country at the start of a 'very small' group interview with less than five candidates. 'I wanted to get others' opinions on this as I thought it was peak Australian corporate culture,' the candidate wrote on Friday. 'At the time I didn't give it a second thought but in retrospect it's pretty weird and unnecessary. 'I understand companies doing these for big/important meetings with higher-ups, but at a job interview it just felt pointless.' A candidate for a customer service role at a Brisbane insurance company was left confused after the hiring manager opened the meeting with a Welcome to Country (stock image) A Welcome to Country can only be delivered by Traditional Owners or Custodians of the land on which the event takes place. It is usually performed by a local Aboriginal Elder to acknowledge and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands. If a Traditional Owner is not available to do a Welcome to Country, an Acknowledgement of Country can be delivered instead. Aussies were quick to share their thoughts, with many agreeing the Welcome to Country had been unnecessary at the job interview. 'I'd say I'm a pretty progressive guy in terms of Aboriginal rights, don't mind a Welcome to Country at a formal or sporting event,' one man wrote. 'However I think Acknowledgement of Country in the workplace for anybody below the CEO (and even then) is the most cringey load of bull**** of all time.' 'Cringe. Did he get up and sing the National Anthem too? Stinks of virtue signalling,' a second commented. 'Do that s*** and I am walking right back out the door,' a third said. 'Interview be damned. I'm not going to work somewhere full of virtue-signalling woke leftist bobble-heads.' A fourth shared: 'It feels pointless to me at every meeting'. Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin is seen performing a Welcome to Country at the A-League Women Grand Final match between Melbourne and Sydney on May 4 Others shared their own experiences of the Aboriginal ceremony. 'I went to a function the Labor Party threw for small businesses to meet a number of Federal MPs,' one person wrote. 'Not only was there a 20 minute Welcome to Country, literally every speaker spent a few minutes doing an Acknowledgement of Country before speaking. 'It's reaching a f****ing bizarre level of performative quasi-religious theatre.' 'I had a photography award night with my local council EVERY person who spoke acknowledged and welcomed... made me not want to participate again just say it once and move on,' a second said. A third shared: 'My experience has been that any meeting I've had that involves HR or similar, will almost always include an Acknowledgement to Country. They seem to take it very seriously, often more so then the 'purpose' of the meeting.' An Acknowledgement of Country is a way to show awareness and respect for Traditional Custodians of the land where a meeting or event is taking place. Its purpose is to recognise the continuing connection of Aboriginal people to Country, and can be delivered by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.

        "content": "The latest Nigerian Idol episode aired Sunday night saw the host IK reveal the contestant who secured the last spot in the top 10. It was a dazzling display of talent as contestants performed to leave an impression strong enough to get them the votes they would need to make it to the next round. The judges asked the contestants to perform songs that Gen Alpha (people born between 2010 and 2025) could appreciate. The stage was set, the lights were dazzling, and the performances were spectacular. Starting with the elephant in the room, IK revealed the fate of Japh Kenti and Lammy, unveiling who had that final spot in the top 10. After a nail-biting wait, it was revealed that Lammy made it through, solidifying his place in the live shows. Chima kicked off the night with a bang, setting the tone with an energetic and infectious opening number. It was the perfect way to get the audience in the mood for what would come, as the judges affirmed him for setting the bar. Gracia’s rendition of “Titanium” had the audience singing along with their hands in the air. Her powerful vocals resonated throughout the stage, making her an instant crowd favourite. Shortly after securing his spot in the top 10, Lammy delivered a heartfelt and emotional performance of “All of Me,” showcasing his vocal range and control. It was a touching moment that connected with the audience. Stevie’s considerable energy had the judges and audience hyped from the moment he got on stage, and his performance was phenomenal. He got the judges on their feet, with Omawumi calling it the night’s best performance.

Lady Ruth brought sultry vibes to the stage with Beyoncé’s “Drunk in Love.” Her performance was steamy and confident, though the judges noted a few off notes. Nevertheless, it was a memorable rendition showcasing her ability to put on a show, which is also crucial. David Garland wowed everyone with his performance of Harry Styles’ “Falling.” 9ice declared it the new best performance of the night, with both Omawumi and Ric Hassani praising his vocal delivery and stage presence. Maio surprised the judges by stepping out of his usual R&B comfort zone to perform Wizkid’s “Ojuelegba.” 9ice, and Ric loved it, applauding his versatility. Omawumi saw it as preparation for even bigger stages ahead. It also seemed like the judges could not align on a singular top performance of the night, as 9ice praised the performance as one of the best of the evening. Taking on a challenge with Andra Day’s “Rise”, Jennifer’s performance left Omawumi speechless! Ric admired her interpretation, and 9ice likened her to a blend of Waje and Omawumi, highlighting her impressive delivery. Mira Clear’s rendition of Sia’s “Unstoppable” had mixed reviews. Omawumi thought it was nice but wanted more, while Ric felt she enjoyed the song more than she paid attention to the delivery of it. 9ice humorously noted that she looked stoppable despite singing “Unstoppable.” Chioma closed the evening with a powerful “Never Enough” performance from The Greatest Showman. Omawumi jokingly remarked that Chioma ‘took her to church’, while Ric and 9ice agreed it was a phenomenal way to close the show, with Ric tagging it his favourite of the evening. Host IK asked the judges who they felt hadn’t shown all their potential. Ric mentioned that Maio and David Garland have more to offer vocally and performance-wise. 9ice also pointed out that Lady Ruth and Mira Clear had more to show. Omawumi humorously responded with her hit song “If you ask me, na who I go ask” but emphasised her pride in all the contestants’ efforts tonight.

        "content": "Trevor Larnach hit a three-run home run, Jose Miranda added a two-run shot and the Minnesota Twins escaped with a 6-5 win over the Kansas City Royals on Monday afternoon in Minneapolis. Alex Kirilloff also drove in a run for Minnesota, which earned its fifth win in the past six games. The teams will meet again Tuesday night in the second contest of a four-game series. Royals hitters Vinnie Pasquantino, Hunter Renfroe, Dairon Blanco and Maikel Garcia each had an RBI. Kansas City has lost back-to-back games after winning the previous eight in a row. Twins right-hander Joe Ryan (4-3) allowed one run on four hits in seven innings. He walked none and struck out nine, which marked his second-most strikeouts of the season. Royals right-hander Alec Marsh (4-2) allowed five runs on five hits in seven innings. He struck out seven with two walks. Twins closer Jhoan Duran collected his seventh save despite a rough ninth inning. He entered the game with two outs in the ninth and Minnesota leading 6-2. Duran promptly hit MJ Melendez with a pitch to load the bases. He then gave up back-to-back RBI infield singles to Blanco and Garcia, and a throwing error by Twins third baseman Willi Castro allowed another run to score as the Royals pulled within 6-5. Duran then got Bobby Witt Jr. to ground out with runners on second and third to end the game. The Twins grabbed a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the third. Edouard Julien hit a one-out single to left, and Miranda followed in the next at-bat with a 437-foot shot to center. In the fifth, Larnach belted a three-run shot to make it 5-0. His 441-foot homer to center also scored Castro and Julien, both of whom reached on walks. Kansas City got on the scoreboard with Pasquantino's RBI single in the sixth. Kirilloff responded for the Twins with an RBI single in the eighth to make it 6-1. The Royals cut the deficit to 6-2 in the top of the ninth. Renfroe pulled a curveball to left for an RBI double that scored Salvador Perez, before Duran replaced fellow reliever Cole Sands to finish the game.

        "description": "BROCKHAMPTON came out on top in the Herefordshire derby beating rivals Bromyard by 46 runs in a low scoring afternoon.",
        "content": "Brockhampton came into the Worcestershire Premier clash looking to boost their points tally after seeing five of their early season matches either cancelled or abandoned. After being put into bat hosts Brockhampton started strongly with skipper Samuel Johnston (19) and Alex Hinkley (53) helping them to 41-2 before the former lost his wicket. Hinkley continued building runs, but at the other end batters came and went as nobody else reached double figures and the hosts were out for 135, helped by 23 extras. Tom Harvey (3-13) led the way for Bromyard with the ball while James Wilson and Hugo Bernard-Pullen each picked up a brace of wickets. With the ball Sam Harn and Sam Didcote did the damage each taking five wickets as Bromyard were bowled out for 89 off 39.5 overs. Top scorer for the visitors was Alexander Woods who hit 34 before being bowled by Harn and caught by Hinkley. In Division One, Bartestree and Lugwardine picked up a losing draw after hosts Himley seconds failed to bowl them out. Skipper Adam Davies had the Himley openers in all sorts of trouble and was unlucky not to pick up a few wickets in his first spell. However, at the half way point Himley sat on 103-0 off 25 overs. Despite bowling on a warm afternoon the Bartestree attack stuck to their task with Owen Beynon 3-51, Stan Lunt 2/61 and Davies 2-68 all taking wickets as Himley finished on 244-6. In reply Bartestree started steadily with Nick Freeman (12) and Matt Tulacz (18) building a solid partnership for the first wicket for 37. Edward Milner then came in with a fine innings of 53 from 55 balls and was well supported by Andy Rodgers (15) and Adam Davies (34). When all three departed, it was left to club stalwarts Alun Evans (17) and Chris Tulacz to finish the day 90 runs short, securing four bonus points. Meanwhile, Burghill, Tillington and Weobley suffered a 97-run defeat at the hands of Coombs Wood. Recent Category 1 overseas amateur signing Nizamudin Khisrow, was the difference between the sides. He top scored with 57 and bagged 4-22 for the home side in their 97 run win. Scoring was challenging at the outset and at drinks, Coombs Wood were 65-2. The Burgs were still in the game at 93-6, until a breezy half-century by Khisrow changed the equation as the hosts finished on 192. The wickets were shared, three a piece by Theo Darke and Reece Thomas and two a piece by Mohammed Hassan and Arjun Singh. Wickets falling at regular intervals in the chase, meant the Burgs were never in the hunt, and they were all out for 95 in 41.4 overs.",

        "content": "Glen Powell has revealed that he “puked in the bushes” after his first viewing of Hidden Figures because he thought he’d “ruined” the film. The US actor played real-life astronaut and former US senator John Glenn in Theodore Melfi’s Oscar-nominated film about the three African-American mathematicians – played by Octavia Spencer, Taraji P Henson and Janelle Monáe – who were pivotal in his historic launch into space back in 1962. Speaking on a recent episode of Therapuss with Jake Shane, the actor admitted that he had seen Top Gun: Maverick, in which he played pilot Hangman, four times. When host Shane reacted with surprise that the star was able to watch his performances back, Powell responded that “it does get in your own head”, adding: “People forget that when you’re watching a rough cut of a movie, it’s probably like watching the footage of yourself that you’re having to edit. So you sit there and you’re like, ‘I hate myself.’” The Anyone But You star then recalled his experience seeing the first cut of the 2016 film. “I remember watching [Hidden Figures] for the first time on the Fox lot – and this was before all the effects were done, the music was in [and] the sound design – and I literally left the movie, and I puked in the bushes,” he said. He continued: “I thought I ruined this movie. I was like, ‘All these women put in these great performances and it’s like the legacy of these women – I was like, I literally ruined this movie.’ “It feels like the most atrocious thing you can do as an actor is just be terrible in a movie about real-life people that need a real-life story.” The actor said that once the music was in, things were more “polished”, adding that “nobody wants to be the weak point in a movie, especially when you’re talking about real-life stories”. In other recent news from the star, who currently stars in the new action-comedy Hit Man, Powell revealed that he was once “hit in the face” by a bouncer who failed to recognise him. Publisher",

Zuma-Sambudla publicly accused the ANC of vote rigging, a serious charge that has drawn widespread attention and concern.

        "content": "Her accusations were substantiated by video evidence she released, which purportedly shows voting materials in Chesterville, KwaZulu-Natal, and Hammarsdale, Mpumalanga. In the days leading up to the Wednesday elections, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, a prominent member of the MK Party (MKP), has stirred significant controversy with her allegations against the African National Congress (ANC). Zuma-Sambudla publicly accused the ANC of vote rigging, a serious charge that has drawn widespread attention and concern. Her accusations were substantiated by video evidence she released, which purportedly shows voting materials in Chesterville, KwaZulu-Natal, and Hammarsdale, Mpumalanga. According to Zuma-Sambudla, these materials were being utilized to illicitly influence the election outcome. The footage was captured over the weekend, a period during which no official voting was taking place. The ANC Of Ramaphosa Has Already Started Stealing Votes In KZN ... — Dudu Zuma-Sambudla (@DZumaSambudla) This timing raised immediate questions and suspicions among the public. In response, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) clarified that the materials depicted in the videos were designated for special votes scheduled on Monday. Despite this explanation, Zuma-Sambudla remained resolute in her claims, maintaining that the ANC was engaging in fraudulent activities and further accusing the IEC of being complicit in these actions. The allegations have not only cast a shadow over the upcoming elections but have also prompted reactions from various stakeholders. Independent election analyst Michael Atkins and other concerned parties have weighed in, suggesting that Zuma-Sambudla’s actions might be in violation of the Electoral Act. They emphasize the need for adherence to legal protocols and caution against the dissemination of unverified claims that could undermine the electoral process. The unfolding situation has heightened tensions and underscored the critical importance of transparency and accountability in the electoral system. Despite the potential breach of the electoral act, Zuma-Sambudla has maintained a defiant stance, asserting that she would sooner face legal repercussions than remain silent. In her view, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has failed to ensure free and fair elections, a charge that has resonated with segments of the public concerned about electoral integrity. It’s Ok If I’m In Breach...I’ll Rather Be In Breach Than Silent!!! But If You Are Honest To Yourself Is In Breach Of FREE AND FAIR Elections — Dudu Zuma-Sambudla (@DZumaSambudla) In response, the IEC, through its spokesperson Kate Bapela, has sought to clarify the situation. According to Bapela, the videos shared by Zuma-Sambudla were misinterpreted and actually depicted authorized logistical arrangements for special voting. The IEC has not taken these allegations lightly and is contemplating measures against the MKP and other individuals involved in disseminating what they describe as misinformation. Beyond official responses, the debate has continued to rage on social media, reflecting the polarized opinions on the matter. Various individuals and groups have weighed in, either supporting Zuma-Sambudla’s accusations or defending the IEC’s actions.",

        "content": "BERNAMA – AirAsia X Bhd’s (AAX) net profit fell slipped to MYR80.11 million in the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 (1Q 2024) from MYR327.99 million in the same quarter last year. Revenue however increased by 66 per cent to MYR908.91 million against MYR548.84 million previously, primarily generated from more ticket sales and ancillary revenue, said the low-cost airline in a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday. In a separate statement, AAX said it posted a solid passenger load factor (PLF) of 83 per cent, up three percentage points year-on-year (y-o-y), with best-performing routes in China, India and Japan recording over 90 per cent PLF. Available seat kilometres increased by 74 per cent y-o-y in line with solid market demand. On network, driven by the commitment to accelerate and regain market leadership and following the extension of the visa-exemption policy to China until 2025, the low-cost airline increased flight frequencies to its popular routes in the country, namely Chengdu, Beijing and Shanghai, on top of ramping up flight frequency to leisure favourite Bali in Indonesia. “Overall, AAX delivered an 85 per cent y-o-y increase in the number of stages to 3,184, with total weekly flights at 135 flights per week on average in 1Q 2024. “The group’s total fleet size remained at 18 A330s as of end-March 2024, with 16 aircraft now activated and operational, while AAX Thailand’s fleet size stood at seven A330s, with an additional aircraft reactivated during the quarter, bringing its fleet of activated and operational aircraft to six,” it added. AAX Chief Executive Officer Benyamin Ismail said the airline expects two remaining aircraft to rejoin the operational fleet in July and November this year, while the group work towards ensuring its fleet requirements for further growth in the future are secured.",

Residents may experience wind gusts of up to 50 mph. \"At 4:49 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a gusty shower capable of producing a landspout 15 miles northeast of Lewistown, moving east at 20 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\" Expect gusty showers in Snyder-Middleswart State Park around 4:55 p.m. Beaver Springs around 5 p.m. other locations impacted by this storm include Beavertown. According to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. Persons in campgrounds should consider seeking sturdy shelter until this gusty shower passes. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 9 p.m. for central Pennsylvania.\" Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall: Beware of rapid water flow: During heavy rain, avoid playing near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk. Maintain safe driving distances: The two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions. Slow down and drive with care: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water. Visibility matters: Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots. When stopping roadside, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "content": "Mancunians have fondly looked back on their university days and nights dancing away on tables after the sudden closure of The Footage bar. The venue, on the corner of Grosvenor Street and Oxford Road , has been a popular drinking spot for students for years, boasting offers and being close to the Manchester Metropolitan University campus and the University of Manchester . But now, the site - operated by Crafted Social, part of the Stonegate Group - has been listed as ‘permanently closed’ on its website. There has been no other announcement on social media about the closure. READ MORE Mystery as beloved Manchester bar with historic past closes suddenly without notice A pop-up message on the website’s booking form tells guests that the venue, which it described itself online as 'the greatest bar in Manchester', closed on Saturday (May 25) and thanked guests for their custom. Following the news, many who spent evenings drinking at the venue have shared their memories on social media. \"Dark times! I’ve worked on Oxford Road for 31 years and the footage has always been there,\" one person commented. \"Aww what a shame, was a stable when I was at uni, I did a revisit of it six years back, took me right back to my student days!\" another added. The Footage, on the corner of Grosvenor Street and Oxford Road, has 'permanently closed' without much warning (Image: The Footage) A number of others said they remembered evenings spent 'dancing on the tables' as they tagged their pals in the news. One said: \"legendary ladies night dancing on tables\" as another wrote: \"Ah those were the days dancing on the tables!\" \"Had some cracking nights in here,\" another person added. The pop-up message on the venue's website said: “We will no longer be trading after the 25th May. It has been a pleasure serving the community and we shall miss you!” Just four days earlier (May 23), the venue had been sharing posts on social media promoting the upcoming Euro's and encouraging people to 'secure the best seats and deals' by booking spots at the pub. The history of the Footage building dates back to 1915 when it first opened as the Grosvenor Picture Palace cinema. Through various incarnations, the venue was last used as a cinema in 1968 before it was taken over as a bingo hall and then a Riley’s Snooker Club. It began a new life as a pub, under the name of the Flea and Firkin, in 1990. A few years later, the pub was rebranded into The Footage and Firkin, before it was taken over by new owners and renamed The Footage. Stonegate gave the venue a £360,000 refurbishment ten years ago, promoting it as a craft beer and live sports venue. The neo-classical building, designed by Percy Hothersall, was also designated with Grade II Listed status by English Heritage in the 1990s. The Manchester Evening News tried to contact Footage directly and was told that the venue is permanently closed, but no further details were made available. Crafted Social have also been approached for comment.",

Ant took a bow as he responded: \"Thank you very much, thank you very much, thank you,\" before Simon added: \"I'm so happy for you really.\" Dec put a hand of support on Ant's shoulder as he smiled at the interaction. Ant then said with a smirk on his face: \"Thank you for your lovely gift,\" before turning to the other judges and joking: \"Judges, still waiting on yours.\" They all laughed as Simon quipped that the gift was from all of them.

        "content": "The Sri Mala Malleswara Swami Kshetram, a temple located on a hill in the Devaragattu forests of Holagunda mandal in Kurnool district, has a fascinating history. Following Dussehra, the temple deity’s celestial event of ‘Kalyanam’ will be celebrated, during which a traditional stick-fighting procession takes place. The Banni Utsav in Devaragattu has become known as ‘Karrala Samaram’, a battle of sticks, although the devotees view it as a tradition rather than a battle. Over the decades, the festival has gained immense significance. In Andhra Pradesh, the Devaragattu Banni festival has been included in the Class X Telugu curriculum. The festival has been incorporated into the new Class X syllabus for the academic year 2024-25. This lesson covers the stick-fighting tradition during the Banni Utsav. It is expected to provide the students an opportunity to learn more about and appreciate this unique festival. The decision to include this festival in the curriculum was taken by the Education Department to ensure that every student is aware of this cultural celebration.

The incident happened at around 3:20pm between Donabate and Balbriggan, Dublin Live reports.

        "content": "As a Fijian Sevens team supporter, I am concerned that the results are not what we had expected from the Fiji men’s rugby 7s team at the HSBC SVNS Singapore tournament. The Fijians were beaten by USA and Great Britain in their pool matches but managed to beat Ireland. However, they failed to make the Cup quarterfinal. As two-time Olympic Games gold medal winners and now being winless in 20 series tournaments, Fiji’s chances of a third Olympic gold medal look glim. For a country, where sevens rugby is its national sport, it is a national issue if we don’t get that gold. So, what’s now? It’s time for the coaches to analyse the approach they need to take. Negotiations must start with overseas clubs and the Fijian Drua, over the release of players needed for the Olympics, which is from July 26 to August 11. Let’s take it step by step and surely, we’ll get to where we want in Paris. Feedback: letters@fijisun.com.fj",

        "content": "AP – Luka Doncic lunged for the ball after a steal by Anthony Edwards, knocking it far enough away to create a scramble and a jump ball the Dallas superstar won. The Mavericks made all the big plays again – on both ends of the court – and are a win away from their first trip to the NBA Finals in 13 years. Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and Dallas put together a decisive run in the final five minutes to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 yesterday for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The 14-3 finish gave the Mavs a fifth consecutive playoff victory after Dereck Lively II left with a sprained neck when the rookie centre took an accidental shot to the back of the head from Karl-Anthony Towns’ knee. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. “Don’t even say it,” said Doncic, who will try to clinch his first trip to the NBA Finals in Game four tomorrow in Dallas. But it feels great. But we’ve got to think about next game. Gotta play with the same mentality. They’re not going to go away. No way.” PJ Washington Jr, who scored 16 points, put Dallas ahead for good on a tiebreaking corner three-pointer with 3:38 remaining after Doncic passed to Irving, who sent the ball to Washington. The co-stars took over from there. Doncic hit a shot in the lane for a four-point lead, Irving sent the crowd into a frenzy on a falling-down jumper and Doncic found Daniel Gafford for an alley-oop dunk and a 113-105 lead with 34 seconds left. Gafford had just blocked Mike Conley’s layup attempt at the other end. “They’re trying to double me the whole game, trying to double Kai, so that just makes us better,” Doncic said. “Everybody touches the ball, everybody plays. We come down to the stretch, and we execute.”",

XDefiant is Ubisoft’s latest free-to-play ‘ ‘ and has so far been a huge hit with players. Building upon decades of FPS experience from the likes of Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, Ubisoft has managed to make a smash hit that could become one of the key industry leaders when it comes to esports FPS titles. to praise the game as a whole, but also discuss the “incessant bunny hopping” that players do when engaging in gun fights saying “You’re not gonna lose players by encouraging boots on the ground, you WILL lose players by doing nothing to tame this awful, goofy and cheesy style of play, especially many of the casuals.” It is surprising that Ubisoft chose to make the gameplay faster in nature and similar to Call of Duty as many of its games, especially in the Tom Clancy series that was originally part of, are much slower-paced. Games such as Ghost Recon have incredibly slow movement and players are killed very quickly in the games. Although bunny hopping is a hated mechanic, it is part of many FPS games now and anyone coming over from the likes of Call of Duty will be used to it by now. It will be interesting to see whether Ubisoft does anything to nerf this so as not to turn away players.

They revealed the chain’s quarter pounder recipe , saying that the burgers are cooked fresh, per the U.S. Sun . The video, which was posted by Essential McDonald’s, showed the entire process of putting the burger together, including the cooking of the meat. McDonald's is offering free McNuggets via app on Wednesday Mom's McDonald's Happy Meal tip branded a 'game-changer' by fans The TikTok user made it clear on their profile that they don’t speak for the company as a whole. They amassed more than 40,000 likes on the video where they detailed the creation of the Quarter Pounder. To no surprise, the burger is created using a quarter pound of beef. Since 2018 the chain has cooked its Quarter Pounder burger fresh in most of the US. Fresh Quarter Pounders are not available in Hawaii and Alaska, and this could be a result of transportation restrictions. McDonald’s supporters and critics fled to the comment section of the video where the burger-making process was detailed to give their two cents.

        "content": "AP – Asian shares were mostly higher yesterday after United States (US) stocks bounced back from Wall Street’s worst day since April to finish higher for the week. US futures slipped while oil prices advanced. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 added 0.7 per cent to 38,900.02 and the Kospi in Seoul jumped 1.2 per cent to 2,717.71. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 0.8 per cent to 2,785.60 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.6 per cent to 3,105.72 as the government reported corporate profits rose 4.3 per cent year-on-year in January-April. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng reversed early losses, gaining 0.7 per cent to 18,736.34. In Taiwan and South Korea, heavy buying of computer chip-related shares pushed benchmarks higher. The Taiex ended 1.1 per cent higher after touching a fresh record. MediaTek, a semiconductor company that provides chips for wireless communications, high-definition television and handheld mobile device jumped 7.5 per cent. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp logged a more modest 0.2 per cent gain. “The robust global semiconductor cycle is positive for Taiwan’s growth outlook,” Raymond Yeung and Bansi Madhavani of ANZ wrote in a research note. “The global semiconductor cycle is strong thanks to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, cloud computing and 5G telecommunications technology,” it said. On Friday, the S&P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 5,304.72 and won back all its losses from the prior two days. It eked out a tiny gain for the week, extending its weekly winning streak to five, and is sitting just below its record set today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 per cent to 39,069.59, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.1 per cent, to 16,920.79, topping an all-time high set earlier in the week. Nvidia rose another 2.6 per cent on Friday, making it the biggest single force pushing the S&P 500 upward. This week’s bumpiness for stocks came despite another blowout profit report from Nvidia, which has rocketed to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks amid a frenzy around AI technology.",

        "content": "Dylan Minnette has spoken about why he chose to quit acting and focus on music instead. The Wallows musician shot to stardom after starring in 13 Reasons Why, but has since revealed that reaching such heights in his career prompted him to reevaluate things. “I was fortunate to find success in [acting],” he said during a recent interview on the Zach Sang Show. “I was on 13 Reasons Why and it was really popular and definitely reached a peak in what I’ve had in acting. But it also started to feel like a bit of a job. I was in a very fortunate position, it was always fun for me, always really inspiring, but then it was just starting to feel like just a job.” The artist now plays in Wallows with bandmates Braeden Lemasters and Cole Preston, sharing that they hope to take things “all the way as far as we can.” “I feel like I’m in a position now where I can just kind of like do that for a while and get this the farthest it can be,” he added. “The only way that’s gonna happen is if I put my 100% time and energy into it and take it very seriously and show the world that we all take this very seriously.” Minnette continued that he still thinks he has “something to give” in acting and is starting to feel “inspiration” in that arena again, but that the band takes priority. “At some point, when we’ve fulfilled our Wallows duties and we’re all ready to take a break as a band, that’s when I’ll have the perfect inspiration to do something,” he shared. Wallows’ new album ‘Model’ came out last week, described by NME in a three-star review as “indie-pop that stays in the comfort zone”. It continued: “‘Model’, then, feels too safe for a band that has been around for this long and is both simultaneously slated for some of their biggest shows yet, but still yet to really leave a footprint in the indie scene. Perhaps the songs from ‘Model’ they decide will flourish in those spaces, but one can’t help feeling like there were risks that should have been taken.” Publisher",

        "content": "AP – Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc won the restarted Monaco Grand Prix from pole position on Sunday for his first Formula One (F1) victory in nearly two years. Leclerc was on pole for the third time in four years, but had previously never finished on the podium at his home race. His first win since Austria in July 2022 took his career tally to six, all with Ferrari. “Tonight’s going to be a big night,” he told his team over the radio. A Monaco victory felt extra special for him, having grown up in a flat overlooking the start-finish line watching cars zooming past below. “No words can explain that. It was the race that made me want to be a F1 driver one day,” the 26-year-old Leclerc said. “Seeing so many of my friends on the balcony, so many people I know. It means a huge amount to me.” The last 15 laps were the most difficult as the realisation of how much winning would mean dawned on him. “I must say I was thinking about my dad,” Leclerc said of his late father. “It was a dream of ours for me to race here and win, so it’s unbelievable.” Championship leader Max Verstappen is bidding for a fourth straight F1 title and saw his lead trimmed to 31 points over second-place Leclerc – 169-138 – with eight races completed. Verstappen started and finished the race sixth for Red Bull, whose other driver Sergio Perez went out of the race after a big first-lap crash. The crash also took out Haas drivers Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg, and caused it to be interrupted by a red flag for 40 minutes. The drivers were not hurt. Leclerc finished about eight seconds ahead of McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and nine seconds clear of Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr in third.",

        "content": "judge was dragged on stage during a rollerskating act and unexpectedly took part. Bruno was spun around in mid-air by Duo Stardust during their daring routine on Monday 27 May. The rollerskating couple paused their act mid-way through to get former judge onto the stage where they laid him between them on their supports. The pair then began spinning and at the same time were lifted into the air with Bruno still between them. The judge screamed as he spun around, meanwhile looked quite pleased as he watched on. And the moment was quite a big hit with fans as well. As the moment played out during the live semi-finals, one viewer commented: “I’m SCREAMING they gave him no choice and just flung him round and round. Should’ve done it to Simon #BrtainsGotTalent.\" Another added: “Poor Bruno getting spun around like a washing machine against his will #BGT.\" A third joked: “I think Bruno should win #BritainsGotTalent.\" A fourth wasn’t so sure Bruno didn't get fair warning and said: “Tonioli pretending he’s forgotten what they rehearsed this afternoon... #BGT.\" Whilst the audience cheered the duo as they finished their performance, and let Bruno go back to his seat, Simon declared he was left quite unimpressed - despite them being his Golden Buzzer act. He said: “I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight” as he received boos from the audience, Simon continued: “I can only say what I feel.” Bruno said: “It worked for me! It’s a bit scary - and I thought that anyway. Every time you were spinning around, I thought she was going to crash. I found it very scary and very dramatic.” But Bruno went on to say he enjoyed it nonetheless. Two acts later and opera singer . One fan said: “He is amazing!”” Another added “This opera singer WOW #BritainsGotTalent.\" The judges were equally impressed and all took to their feet to compliment him. Alesha said: “How do I sum it up? You’re the one to beat.” Amanda added: “What’s amazing is how slight you are and I never see you take a breath then you do those notes that last forever. I think Alesha’s right, you’re the one to beat tonight.” Simon said: “We felt how much this means to you” before he went on to say: \"You deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented.”",

We asked Emma to guide us through ten of the songs that changed her life. From a ska punk icon to some hardcore heroes and a truly game-changing rap superstar, her picks turned out to be as varied as they are excellent. Here's what she came up with. “I heard the band , and it was a defining moment for me. The song inspired our song – especially the bridge and the hook into the end breakdown, and the ‘I despise the drinking father’ aspect [ features the lyric, ‘just a broken old man broken by the whiskey’]. When I was a kid, that song resonated with me because of what I was going through [with my alcoholic stepfather]. “I love by ! I’ve listened to since I was seven – my mom was a huge indie rock kid. When we drove to my grandparents’ house three hours away, was one of the CDs we would have on repeat. It was the first time I’d ever heard a woman in a rock band, and Gwen Stefani is such an icon. “ s is kind of a memoir, and it was pretty unique for bands at that time to write the way they did about the topic of grief, Howard Jones singing his heart out the way he did. The first time I ever heard them, I was 13, and it was on , but I didn’t properly appreciate them until six or seven years ago. “I had this roommate when I was 18 or 19; she disappeared completely, left half her belongings, and we never heard from her again. But she left ’s on CD, and I kind of inherited it. I remember hearing the intro to , the piano lead into Peter Steele’s really sultry voice, and I had an out-of-body experience. It was one of the first times I realised metal can bend, and it can be whatever you want it to be. “ are one of Dying Wish’s biggest influences, and especially is really influential. I saw [former vocalist] Bruce LePage write on Twitter, ‘I’m not anyone special, just a junkie who wrote some songs you like.’ That’s so real. I’m no different to anyone else in the room, I firmly believe in that. “ is my favourite song. It’s about killing someone who caused a lot of bodily harm to a woman. Jamey [Jasta, vocals] has talked a lot about how he was brought up, it’s part of the puzzle you can put together, and I really like that.

I grew up such an angry kid, and I feel like it had a lot to do with the downfall in areas of my life. Hearing how sad she was, how much she didn’t love herself, was pained by others... but at the end it’s nothing but love. That changed the way that I walk in life. “It was hard to pick just one song by , but the album changed my life. It’s the best concept record ever made, and he’s one of the best rappers alive. especially does not miss any beats. I saw him in LA and it was just unreal. “I love so much.

She’s a massive queer icon; gay people don’t get a lot of representation in country music, and she’s at the forefront of changing that. I grew up listening to some country, and moving to Nashville helped me learn to love it so much. “ s tells an incredible story, and it’s one of the only songs on the album I can listen to without crying. I’m such a sucker for a coming- of-age story, and it’s about living in the moment more than anything, where she’s hitchhiking across the country and discovers that love is what she and this guy driving her had the whole time.” Will's been a metal obsessive ever since hearing Trivium’s Ascendancy way back in 2005, and it's been downhill ever since.

        "content": "SEASON 19 of America's Got Talent will premiere on May 28, 2024, on NBC. While auditions may be closed for this season, fans are eager to know when they'll have their next big shot on the show . Each year, America's Got Talent sees hundreds of amazing acts from singers to magicians. In order to get on the show, performers have to audition. However, the process is more than just showing up and showing the judges what they've got. According to America's Got Talent's website , performers can either attend an in-person or virtual open call. Additionally, if they can't do either, they'll have the opportunity to send a 90-second video audition. NBC's Unscripted Formats Manager, Theresa Graham told NBC : \"If they think that somebody is worth considering, they put them through to our executive producers. \"After they say yes, then the Act will go to audition in front of the Judges. We all see everything play out from there.\" While auditions for season 19 have already closed, the show will open auditions for season 20 soon. While America's Got Talent states anybody can audition, the show has a few requirements worth considering before taking the next step. Some requirements to consider are: If the producers move you to the celebrity judge audition, performers should be sure they're \"camera ready.\" This means they will need to be fully in costume , hair, and makeup would need to be done prior to coming, and performers will need to bring all props with them. If you have your own music , producers will put you in contact with the music coordinator who will help edit your track so it reflects the 90-second audition time. While performers would need to be fully dressed for their audition, they aren't allowed to wear clothes with logos on them.",

        "content": "President Joe Biden is currently losing the 2024 presidential race to former President Donald Trump. If the election were held tomorrow, Trump would win — likely convincingly. The fact that this is increasingly obvious, and that Biden finds himself fighting an uphill battle to prolong his already ancient political career, has precipitated some epic handwringing on the MSNBC airwaves and a veritable five-alarm fire at the Democratic National Committee. The big polling news last week was that The New York Times /Siena College, one of the country’s most accurate pollsters, has Trump up in five of the six most important swing states — including an astonishing 13-point cushion in light-blue Nevada, and a nine-point lead in purple Georgia. This week, the big polling update came courtesy of the Cook Political Report, another highly regarded polling outfit. The Cook Political Report poll also has Trump leading or tied in each of the seven states polled — in both a mano-a-mano and a three-way race that also takes into account independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The fact that the Cook Political Report corroborated the eye-opening Times/Siena findings from the week prior led polling savant Nate Silver to post this warning on Thursday: “If Biden is still struggling in August, he needs to consider stepping aside. It’s not a great situation for Democrats either way, but you have to do due diligence on the question. It’s an important election, obviously. It shouldn’t be taboo to talk about.” Indeed, polling cross-tabs routinely show that a plurality or majority of Democrats would prefer Biden do just that: Step aside and exit the national stage. The party’s basic conundrum is this: Democrats purport to view Trump as an existential threat to “our democracy,” but they are being led to the political slaughter by their senile octogenarian-in-chief. So perhaps Democrats are planning to depose Biden and pull the old switcheroo at their summertime nominating convention in Chicago — a spectacle already expected to be mass-protested by pro-Hamas radicals who abhor the man they call “Genocide Joe”? It’s not going to happen. Democrats, whether they like it or not, are stuck with the doddering Delawarean dolt as their 2024 presidential nominee. Biden first arrived in Washington, D.C., as a U.S. senator in Jan. 1973. He first ran for president in 1988 — the year before your humble columnist was even born. Good luck trying to convince him to voluntarily bow out, after he finally ran a successful presidential race on his third try. Furthermore, the fact that Biden is so decrepit and diminished makes it less likely he will receive earnest advice to drop out from those around him — in his weakened state, he is merely a puppet to be taken advantage of by close staffers and confidants. And there is no more cynical or self-serving confidant than his wife “Dr.” Jill Biden, a 21st-century Lady Macbeth if there ever were one. But there is an even clearer, more obvious reason the Democrats have no choice but to roll the dice with Biden this fall. Democrats, humorously, are now trapped by a self-defeating intersectional quagmire of their very own making. The single most frequently floated suggestion for the Democrat who can swoop into the August convention in Chicago and save the day for the donkeys is California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Other possibilities are thought to include Vice President Kamala Harris, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. There is a glaring structural problem here. If Democrats leapfrog the Black female Harris to choose any of these white men — especially the Hollywood villain-resembling Newsom — they will have committed an egregious sin, according to the tenets of their very own woke catechism and “diversity, equity and inclusion” ideology. How can the Democratic Party, which two years ago explicitly chose Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace the retiring Stephen Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that she is a Black woman, now defenestrate the first Black woman to ever serve as president or vice president? And to do so for a dreaded white man? Scandalous! Democrats simply can’t do it. And they doubly can’t do it at a time when their presidential ticket is struggling so mightily to retain Black support — especially younger Black males, who show signs of trending toward Republicans at historic margins. There is therefore no world in which Biden is discarded for anyone other than Harris herself. But Harris may well be the only Democrat in Washington, D.C., less popular than Uncle Joe himself. The dimwitted cackler-in-chief is about as popular these days as venereal disease. Democrats therefore have no choice but to take a deep breath, pray to the deity they probably don’t believe in, and roll the dice with their impotent current ticket. And Republicans couldn’t possibly be happier about it.",

        "description": "Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans is gutted that NSW captain James Tedesco has been dropped but proud of Manly teammate Jake Trbojevic for filling breach.",
        "content": "Queensland skipper Daly Cherry-Evans says the axing of former NSW captain James Tedesco \"sucks\" because he has been in the same position and understands the pain. On the flip side it is a bittersweet moment as Jake Trbojevic, his soulful, competitive Manly teammate and great friend, has become NSW skipper instead. Cherry-Evans, 35, and 30-year-old Trbojevic will go head-to-head in an old-fashioned 'mate v mate' State of Origin confrontation in Sydney on June 5 in the State of Origin series opener. \"That theme hasn't necessarily disappeared but it has been a bit hard to lean into a bit lately, without those sort of rivalries,\" Maroons half Cherry-Evans said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"But two (Origin) captains each coming from the same club is as good as it gets,\" The pair mark the first club teammates to captain opposing states since 2000, when Sydney Roosters duo Brad Fittler and Adrian Lam led NSW and Queensland. Cherry-Evans is also a good friend of Tedesco, shares the same management company, and has represented Australia alongside him. The 2011 premiership winner was dropped in 2015 from the Maroons and spent three years in the Origin wilderness. So news of 31-year-old fullback Tedesco's axing in favour of Penrith's Dylan Edwards - after Tedesco and Cherry-Evans had contested four consecutive Origin series against each other as opposition captains - hit home. \"That's hard because I have been there before. I have been dropped from Queensland and it sucks,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"There are really no words to explain it because we as footy players want to keep doing it forever and ever. \"I'm not here to say the door is shut on Teddy to play for the Blues ever again but obviously it hurts initially. \"They have ... gone with Dylan. Madge (NSW coach Michael Maguire) is obviously not afraid to make the moves that he thinks will put them in the best position. \"As a friend of Teddy's, it was definitely disappointing.\" Cherry-Evans explained his mixed emotions in a nutshell. \"Teddy gets dropped and my current teammate becomes captain. It is hard not to be really happy and proud for Jake for how hard he has worked and his perseverance as a footy player,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"He continually rocks up and plays good footy each week and it is amazing to see where he is now. He is NSW captain.\" It is why Cherry-Evans expects to face a NSW side, led by middle forward Trbojevic, that will give no quarter. \"He is a win-at-all-costs player. Jake doesn't have a good poker face,\" Cherry-Evans grinned. \"That is the best way to explain it. If (Manly) have lost, he is not happy. With the wins, he rides them just as hard as anyone else. I am really proud of Jake. He has worked so hard and been super-competitive for a long time.\" Cherry-Evans said he had texted Trbojevic \"to say congrats\" but that they wouldn't speak again before the series opener.",

        "content": "A JOINT bank account can make managing your finances as a couple easier. However, there are a few things to consider before opening a joint bank account with a partner you are not married to. If you have spending habits similar to your partner's and have been together for a while, creating a joint bank account may be a smart financial move. Doing so can make financial decision-making easier and even improve relationship satisfaction for couples of at least one year according to studies. Couples can open a joint checking or savings account whether they are married or not. However, both parties must get approval from the bank to open an account. Joint accounts operate similarly to regular bank accounts, with the key difference being that they have two owners, each with complete access to all the account's features. Each owner can check the account balance, make purchases and deposits, receive a debit card, and transfer funds to an external account. Each person legally owns half the money in the joint account. Sarah Brady from Yahoo Finance shared four things couples should consider before opening a joint account. First, a couple should consider if each party is financially reliable and if they have similar spending habits. It is also a good idea to review your credit reports and financial statements as a couple to determine if you're ready to take on your partner's financial challenges. 2. What if you break up? Brady noted it is important for couples to plan ahead in the event they break up. Couples should discuss how the account funds and remaining expenses would be divided before closing the joint account. 3. How will you split your budget? A third thing to consider is how shared expenses would be split up. Couples should assign responsibility for managing each household bill. There are several alternatives for couples who are not ready yet to pool their money into a joint account. Linked Accounts: With linked accounts, each party can maintain their own account but link the two together. Your significant other will not have access to your funds but will be able to see your account activity. Having linked accounts also makes it easier to transfer funds between the two, as they're with the same bank. Hybrid Approach: A hybrid approach involves having separate accounts as well as one joint account to use for shared expenses. Shared Money Management Apps: This option involves using a budgeting app made for couples, such as Honeydue. These apps allow you to link bank accounts and split expenses, but each party can determine what information is viewable by their partner. They should also discuss their expectations regarding how much each person will deposit into the account and clarify which personal expenses should or should not be covered by the joint account. 4. When will you review your finances? Brady advised couples considering a joint account to schedule a time to assess their finances each month, as having such regularly scheduled discussions can improve their financial well-being. Doing so can help prevent financial mistakes and track progress toward shared goals. Brady also shared several pros and cons of opening a joint bank account. Having a bank account together makes it convenient to split household bills and save for mutual expenses and goals. It also holds you accountable for your financial habits and can increase your sense of partnership and odds of remaining as a couple. However, a joint bank account can result in financial dependence on a partner and less financial privacy. Plus, your partner could make purchases you don't consent to, or in rare instances, they could revoke your status as an account owner without your knowledge.

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are fighting for a handful of key battlegrounds — including Arizona , Nevada , Wisconsin and Michigan — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) telling CBS that Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead with 36.6 percent to Biden’s 36.5 percent , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an event to tout the PACT Act aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly half a million votes four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the only Southern state to side with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state back to red . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told NBC News that the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its ambitions of flipping states such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A poll conducted for Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, according to DDHQ , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by Spectrum News . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but he did say in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one new Siena College poll puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump said during a radio interview on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by 16 points last cycle , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as reported by the New Jersey Monitor . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump told Breitbart back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at turning New Mexico red last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly 10 points . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a 7-point Biden edge in the state.",

        "description": "Queensland captain Daly Cherry-Evans is gutted that NSW captain James Tedesco has been dropped but proud of Manly teammate Jake Trbojevic for filling breach.",
        "content": "Queensland skipper Daly Cherry-Evans says the axing of former NSW captain James Tedesco \"sucks\" because he has been in the same position and understands the pain. On the flip side it is a bittersweet moment as Jake Trbojevic, his soulful, competitive Manly teammate and great friend, has become NSW skipper instead. Cherry-Evans, 35, and 30-year-old Trbojevic will go head-to-head in an old-fashioned 'mate v mate' State of Origin confrontation in Sydney on June 5 in the State of Origin series opener. \"That theme hasn't necessarily disappeared but it has been a bit hard to lean into a bit lately, without those sort of rivalries,\" Maroons half Cherry-Evans said. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"But two (Origin) captains each coming from the same club is as good as it gets,\" The pair mark the first club teammates to captain opposing states since 2000, when Sydney Roosters duo Brad Fittler and Adrian Lam led NSW and Queensland. Cherry-Evans is also a good friend of Tedesco, shares the same management company, and has represented Australia alongside him. The 2011 premiership winner was dropped in 2015 from the Maroons and spent three years in the Origin wilderness. So news of 31-year-old fullback Tedesco's axing in favour of Penrith's Dylan Edwards - after Tedesco and Cherry-Evans had contested four consecutive Origin series against each other as opposition captains - hit home. \"That's hard because I have been there before. I have been dropped from Queensland and it sucks,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"There are really no words to explain it because we as footy players want to keep doing it forever and ever. \"I'm not here to say the door is shut on Teddy to play for the Blues ever again but obviously it hurts initially. \"They have ... gone with Dylan. Madge (NSW coach Michael Maguire) is obviously not afraid to make the moves that he thinks will put them in the best position. \"As a friend of Teddy's, it was definitely disappointing.\" Cherry-Evans explained his mixed emotions in a nutshell. \"Teddy gets dropped and my current teammate becomes captain. It is hard not to be really happy and proud for Jake for how hard he has worked and his perseverance as a footy player,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"He continually rocks up and plays good footy each week and it is amazing to see where he is now. He is NSW captain.\" It is why Cherry-Evans expects to face a NSW side, led by middle forward Trbojevic, that will give no quarter. \"He is a win-at-all-costs player. Jake doesn't have a good poker face,\" Cherry-Evans grinned. \"That is the best way to explain it. If (Manly) have lost, he is not happy. With the wins, he rides them just as hard as anyone else. I am really proud of Jake. He has worked so hard and been super-competitive for a long time.\" Cherry-Evans said he had texted Trbojevic \"to say congrats\" but that they wouldn't speak again before the series opener.",

        "content": "Thammanoon Niyomtrong and Hasanboy Dusmatov will once again travel separate paths. The Ring has confirmed that the twice-ordered mandatory WBA strawweight title fight is once again back on hold. A purse bid hearing scheduled for Monday was canceled upon request from both sides. Thailand’s Niyomtrong, The Ring’s No. 4-rated strawweight , was granted approval to enter a voluntary defense. Dusmatov will instead bid for a second Gold medal as he represents Uzbekistan in the 2024 Paris Olympics. “Both teams asked permission for the purse bid to be canceled,” WBA Championship Committee vice chairman Julio Thyme informed The Ring. “Hasanboy requested to be allowed to participate in the Olympics. Niyomtrong requested a voluntary.” Dusmatov (7-0, 5 knockouts), No. 9 at 105 , won a Gold medal in 2016 Rio. Niyomtrong (24-0, 9 KOs), better known as Knockout CP Freshmart, is approaching eight years as full WBA 105-pound titleholder. The upgrade came via twelve-round unanimous decision over Nicaragua’s Byron Rojas in their June 2016 title consolidation bout. He is the longest-reigning current male titleholder, though he is coming up on two years since his last fight. The 33-year-old from Surin, Thailand has made eleven successful defenses of the WBA ‘Super’ title. The last was a July 2022 points win over countryman and former WBC titlist Wanheng ‘TBE’ Menayothin in Chonburi, Thailand. Niyomtrong was then mandated to face WBA ‘Regular’ titlist Erick Rosa. The matter resulted in two separately called purse bids and a canceled March 2023 meeting due to visa issues. Rosa ultimately moved up in weight earlier this year. Niyomtrong was then ordered to next face Dusmatov on February 7. The two sides agreed to briefly pause the fight. Dusmatov moved up two divisions in an April 14 ten-round decision win over Spain’s Samuel Carmona in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The event was sanctioned by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but not an actual presiding commission. Because of this, a certain hotdog suit-wearing BoxRec editor refused to recognize the official result. Niyomtrong was granted the opportunity to enter a voluntary defense at the time but has remained inactive. His team will now make a more determined effort to get him back in the ring this summer.

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are fighting for a handful of key battlegrounds — including Arizona , Nevada , Wisconsin and Michigan — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) telling CBS that Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead with 36.6 percent to Biden’s 36.5 percent , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an event to tout the PACT Act aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly half a million votes four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the only Southern state to side with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state back to red . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told NBC News that the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its ambitions of flipping states such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A poll conducted for Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, according to DDHQ , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by Spectrum News . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but he did say in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one new Siena College poll puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump said during a radio interview on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by 16 points last cycle , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as reported by the New Jersey Monitor . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump told Breitbart back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at turning New Mexico red last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly 10 points . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a 7-point Biden edge in the state.",

        "content": "AFP – Pep Guardiola promised Manchester City will bounce back next season from their FA Cup final disappointment as the English champions celebrated a fourth consecutive Premier League title with a parade yesterday. Defeat to local rivals Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup final prevented City becoming the first English side to ever complete consecutive league and cup doubles. But there was still a historic achievement to mark for Guardiola’s men after becoming the first team to ever win four consecutive English top-flight titles. Thousands of fans braved torrential rain to see their heroes travel through Manchester’s Deansgate area on open-top buses. However, the number were substantially down on last year’s parade to celebrate a Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup treble. “We will be back next season,” Guardiola said. “The FA Cup, we will take it.” City have won six of the last seven Premier League titles under Guardiola, who has just one year remaining on his contract. ABOVE & BELOW: Manchester City’s manager Pep Guardiola waves to fans during an open-top bus victory parade; and Erling Haaland and Phil Foden celebrate with the Premier League trophy: PHOTO: AFP & AP PHOTO: AFP & AP The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss laughed off a plea to “stay forever” in Manchester but has committed to at least see out his deal next season. “Even myself, I couldn’t expect to stay here eight years but everything goes well,” added Guardiola. “Step-by-step we are here. It looks routine but it’s not routine.” Phil Foden won the football writers’ player of the year award for his stellar season, which included 27 goals. Despite City hoovering up trophies during Guardiola’s reign, the England international insists the hunger remains to keep winning. “Obviously (four in a row) is something nobody else has done before. It’s an unbelievable feeling,” said Foden. “There is a hunger inside me to win trophies and the other players want to win as well. We’re delighted with this season but next season we want to go again and win more.” City sealed the Premier League title a week ago with a 3-1 victory over West Ham. Players were then captured out celebrating until the early hours of last Monday morning, but captain Kyle Walker was adamant that played no role in an uncharacteristically poor display against United at Wembley. City trailed 2-0 at half-time to goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo and a second half fightback was too little, too late despite Jeremy Doku pulling a goal back. “We celebrated on Sunday, this was Saturday. It’s six days. If us athletes can’t recover in six days there’s no chance for anyone,” said Walker. “The moment was right. The club, the players and staff made that decision. Let’s not blame that.”",

        "content": "EDMONTON — Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won't face criminal charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province's law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. \"(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips' data,\" reads the letter, dated May 17. \"The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service's) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.\" The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. \"(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,\" the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name \"Mike Corps,\" which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts under the Police Act — being an accessory to Woronuk's offences and failing to report them. Phillips said she was relieved at the police watchdog's conclusions. \"We have at least some measure of accountability, that there's been an acknowledgement of the deep harm and the personal cost that that harm did to me from the Lethbridge Police Service,\" she said. \"It is unacceptable in a democracy that a duly elected person, a minister of the Crown is targeted and victimized by law enforcement simply because they don't like her politics. And that is what happened to me.\" Phillips pointed to a number of other examples where the Crown has declined to prosecute despite the watchdog's recommendations. \"What we have here is a structural systemic issue that our side of the house would certainly be welcome working with the government on to make sure that there are enough resources and expertise there,\" she said. \"This is not ideological. Police accountability and oversight is something that we all have an interest in, particularly when it is so crucial to our basic institutions of democracy.\" Alberta Justice Minister Mickey Amery has said he will review the relationship between the watchdog and the Crown prosecution service. In 2020, both Lethbridge officers received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. One of the officers has since left the police force. The Lethbridge Police Service says an internal investigation into the actions of the remaining officer is underway. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "For the first time, Nunavut has an MRI machine. The team at the Qikiqtani General Hospital in Iqaluit made history earlier this month when they performed the first head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Nunavut. Until now, people who had suffered head trauma were scanned using the CT scanner at the hospital. \"The number medevaced for head scans will decrease, now that babies and pregnant people can be scanned locally due to the low-strength magnets used in the portable MRI,\" Department of Health spokesperson Pam Coulter said in an email. The portable machine cost $640,000 and its five-year service contract was an additional $300,000. With shipping, the total cost was just over $1 million, Coulter said. The machine can be moved throughout the hospital. (Submitted by Nunavut Department of Health) John Main, Nunavut's health minister, said the machine \"opens up new possibilities,\" given fewer people will need to be sent south. Nunavut's health department said there are 80 brain CT scans performed each month at the Qikiqtani General Hospital. The CT scanner at the hospital is being replaced on June 8 and will not be available for six weeks. The MRI machine will allow brain scans to continue in-territory while that happens. \"Without this replacement piece of equipment, we would have been required to send those 80 people south,\" Main said. \"We're going to be actively monitoring how much it's being used.\" Nunavut gets $35 million from Ottawa for health care services There were 4,900 scans performed in the last year on the CT scanner in Iqaluit. The new MRI machine is portable, is managed on an iPad and can be moved throughout the hospital. \"The equipment can go a patient's bedside,\" Main said. Coulter said the machine does not detect additional injuries or diseases.",

        "description": "One of the keys for the Raiders this offseason will be mastering new offensive coordinator Luke Getsy’s scheme. So far, so good, according to tight end Michael Mayer.",
        "content": "Michael Mayer was diplomatic when asked about new offensive coordinator Luke Getsy. The Raiders second-year tight end was asked to explain the differences between Getsy’s scheme and the one taught by former coach Josh McDaniels last season. “It’s easier than last year,” Mayer said Tuesday after the Raiders finished an organized team activity. How so? “I’d say it’s a little bit more simple,” Mayer said. “A little bit more simple, a little bit easier to understand.” What that means for a Raiders offense that finished 27th in yards per game (289.5) and 23rd in points per game (19.5) last season remains to be seen. But a scheme that’s easier to digest could lead to a more confident, cohesive and efficient attack. There were times last year where the Raiders seemed bogged down by the complexities of McDaniels’ offense. That makes it all the more important that they pick up Getsy’s ideas as fast as possible with OTAs continuing this week. A new look Getsy joins the Raiders after spending two years as the Bears offensive coordinator. He was fired by Chicago in January after failing to maximize the team’s attack under young quarterback Justin Fields. The Raiders believe Fields was more of the problem than Getsy, who was a highly regarded offensive assistant in Green Bay before joining the Bears. Chicago also showed Fields the door as well soon after Getsy’s departure. The Bears traded him to Pittsburgh for a sixth-round pick, setting the franchise up to take Southern California quarterback Caleb Williams first overall in April’s draft. Gesty doesn’t have a settled quarterback situation with the Raiders, either. Second-year passer Aidan O’Connell and veteran Gardner Minshew are competing for the starting role this offseason. Neither is the runner Fields is, but both might be better fits for the West Coast offense Getsy is bringing to Las Vegas. The scheme is centered around quick, intermediate throws expected to be delivered with precise timing. Getsy also has a set of intriguing weapons to work with. The Raiders’ skill-position group includes wide receivers Davante Adams, Jakobi Meyers, Tre Tucker and Michael Gallup, tight ends Mayer and Brock Bowers and running back Zamir White, who should fit well with Getsy’s outside zone running scheme. Adams should be familiar with the system as well after being coached by Getsy in Green Bay. The offense has a few key components. Getsy wants to run the ball effectively. He wants to make play-action passes a staple. He wants to attack the middle of the field and take shots when available. “Yeah, I think there’s certain things that are kind of non-negotiable in your play style, right, and the mindset that you want to bring,” Getsy said. “And fortunately, I’ve been around a lot of really good football coaches that have kind of exposed me to a lot of different styles of play and different ways of approaching teams and finding different ways to attack the different styles of defense that we face each week.” Being adaptable Getsy will also be flexible depending on the situation. He showed an ability to adjust when the Raiders played the Bears on Oct. 22 last season. Fields was hurt, so backup Tyson Bagent got the start. Bagent, an undrafted free agent, led Chicago to a 30-12 victory running an offense that looked far different than the one built for Fields. Raiders coach Antonio Pierce, who was in charge of the team’s linebackers at the time, said after hiring Getsy that game built up his admiration for his new offensive coordinator. Getsy believes that kind of adaptability is just part of the job. “I mean, you could go into Week 3 thinking you have one style of roster and in Week 4, it can be completely different, right?” Getsy said. “I mean, just using that example, we had completely two different styles of QBs in Chicago. ... I think the most important thing is finding a way to maximize the type of guy that you have, figuring out what they do well and that’s the phase that we’re in right now. We’re all trying to figure each other out and figure out what we do best.” It sounds simple. So far for the Raiders, it feels that way, too. That’s why Mayer sees promise in what the team is building. “I’m very happy with the way this offense is going so far and what we’re going to be able to do on the offensive side,” Mayer said.

        "content": "PATNA: 22-year-old final-year student of Patna's B N College was beaten to death by a group of 10-15 masked assailants in the parking lot of Patna Law College , where he had come to write an exam on Monday. The deceased was identified as Harsh Kumar, son of Vaishali-based journalist Ajit Kumar. Harsh, pursuing BA English (H), was recently seen campaigning for Shambhavi Choudhary, LJP (RV) nominee from Samastipur LS seat and daughter of Ashok Choudhary, a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet. Police said he had been involved in a brawl with some Patna University students over organising a 'dandiya night' event during Dussehra last year. The attack took place at 12.45pm. The attackers cornered Harsh near the college parking and began hitting him with rods and bricks. Passersby looked on but none intervened. Harsh was rushed to Patna MCH where doctors declared him dead. City SP (east) Bharat Soni said cops were yet to ascertain the cause of the murder as well as the assailants' identities. Refusing to comment on the attack, Patna Law College principal Mohd Sharif said, \"I do not know anything.\" According to Harsh's family, he was politically active and wanted to contest the students' union elections.",

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are fighting for a handful of key battlegrounds — including Arizona , Nevada , Wisconsin and Michigan — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) telling CBS that Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead with 36.6 percent to Biden’s 36.5 percent , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an event to tout the PACT Act aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly half a million votes four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the only Southern state to side with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state back to red . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told NBC News that the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its ambitions of flipping states such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A poll conducted for Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, according to DDHQ , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by Spectrum News . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but he did say in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one new Siena College poll puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump said during a radio interview on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by 16 points last cycle , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as reported by the New Jersey Monitor . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump told Breitbart back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at turning New Mexico red last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly 10 points . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a 7-point Biden edge in the state.",

        "content": "An 18-year-old pupil was detained in western France on Monday after stabbing his English teacher in the face and fleeing, authorities said. The teacher from the town of Chemille-en-Anjou in western France “suffered a facial injury that is not life-threatening”, said a joint statement from the authorities including the prefect and public prosecutor. Law enforcement officers could be seen in front of the Lycee de l’Hyrome where the attack took place on Monday morning, according to an AFP photographer at the scene. Speaking to reporters, public prosecutor Eric Bouillard ruled out “any religious or radical motive”, adding that the suspect expressed feelings of “unhappiness.” According to the prosecutor’s account, the pupil attacked the teacher during class after a break. He “grabbed the teacher from behind and stabbed her in the face, causing panic in the classroom,” he said. After the attack the suspect quickly left through the window, abandoning his knife, according to the authorities. He was detained by gendarmes and municipal police. Bouillard said the pupil did not seem to have any grievances against the teacher, he added. Bouillard said that while the teacher was hit in the cheek and her injury was minor “the psychological impact” will be “much greater”, Bouillard said. The young man had been a pupil at the school for three years and returned there Monday after an absence due to illness. Fellow pupils said he appeared in a good mood on Monday morning. READ ALSO: Macron Arrives In Germany As He Seeks To Soothe Ties On State Visit The suspect bought the knife last week, the prosecutor said. “He saw this knife and bought it, knowing that he was going to do something with it,” he said, adding that the pupil complained of “too much pressure.” Officials said the young man was not previously known to the police, adding that counselling was provided to pupils and teachers after the attack. An investigation into “attempted murder” has been launched. Education Minister Nicole Belloubet said she was “deeply shocked and outraged”. “My thoughts are with the victim and the entire educational community”, she added on X. France has in recent years been shaken by a series of school incidents involving attacks on teachers as well as schoolchildren by their peers. In April, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal announced measures to crack down on teenage violence in and around schools, as the government seeks to reclaim ground on security from the far-right ahead of upcoming European elections.

According to the NCC data, Starlink’s active customers in Nigeria surged 113 per cent in Q4 2023, from 11,207 customers in the previous quarter, establishing it as one of the leading ISPs in the country. Meanwhile, Spectranet, one of the oldest ISPs in the country, maintained its top position in the market with 113,869 active customers. FiberOne followed in second place with 27,000 active users at the end of 2023. ISPs are different from mobile Internet providers, like the telcos such as MTN, Airtel, etc. They provide Internet through various wired technologies, such as DSL, cable, fibre-optic, or satellite connections. They use fixed infrastructure that requires a physical connection to the home or business. Starlink launched its services in Nigeria in January 2023, becoming the first African country to receive the service, more than 20 months after SpaceX met with the NCC to outline their deployment plans. As of September 2023, just 8 months after its launch, Starlink had amassed 11,207 active subscribers in Nigeria, making it the fourth largest ISP in the country. To further drive adoption, Starlink Nigeria implemented a 21 per cent discount on its starter kit in October 2023, reducing the price from N378,000 ($378) to N299,500 ($299). Last month, The PRIMANEWS reported that more ISPs slashed their hardware cost by more than 45 per cent, bringing it down to N440,000 from a previous price of nearly N1m. The NCC’s database further revealed that by the end of 2023, Nigeria had 245 licensed ISPs. However, recent customer data indicates that only 106 of those ISPs had active customers in the fourth quarter of 2023. The 106 ISPs collectively served 262,206 active customers during that period. Moreover, seven new ISPs have been licensed this year, increasing the total number of licensed ISPs to 252.",

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are fighting for a handful of key battlegrounds — including Arizona , Nevada , Wisconsin and Michigan — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) telling CBS that Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead with 36.6 percent to Biden’s 36.5 percent , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an event to tout the PACT Act aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly half a million votes four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the only Southern state to side with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state back to red . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told NBC News that the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its ambitions of flipping states such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A poll conducted for Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, according to DDHQ , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by Spectrum News . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but he did say in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one new Siena College poll puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump said during a radio interview on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by 16 points last cycle , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as reported by the New Jersey Monitor . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump told Breitbart back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at turning New Mexico red last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly 10 points . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a 7-point Biden edge in the state.",

        "content": "US Central Command said it shot down a drone over the Red Sea after it was launched from Houthi-controlled area in Yemen early Monday morning. The drone was shot out of the sky around 4 a.m. after military personnel determined that it it was hostile, according to a press release. “It was determined the [uncrewed aerial system] presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels in the region,” US Central Command said in a statement . “These actions are taken to protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition, and merchant vessels.” On Monday, the Houthis claimed to have attacked two destroyers in the Red Sea as well as three ships in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, according to Reuters . The US strike comes after Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed to have downed a US MQ-9 Reaper over the province of Marib and a second US MQ-9 Reaper drone days later. Tensions between the West and the Houthi rebels, an Iranian-backed Shia Islamist political group that has sought political control over Yemen, have simmered shortly after the dawn of the Israel-Hamas war late last year. Since the war, the US has been forced to shoot down a slew of missiles and drones from the Houthis, widely regarded as one of Iran’s top proxy forces in the region. The Houthis have claimed that their attacks on Western assets are a sign of solidarity with the Palestinians. Back in January, President Biden re-listed the Houthis as a terrorist organization after delisting the group in 2021 – a reversal of a Trump administration policy. The US also conducted a wave of strikes on Houthi-backed targets earlier in the year after the Houthis wreaked havoc with critical shipping lanes.",

        "content": "CHAMPAIGN — Tip Reiman and Griffin Moore got the majority of the snaps at tight end for Illinois during the 2023 season. Neither will be on the field in Champaign this fall for the Illini. Reiman was selected in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals in April. Moore entered the transfer portal after the conclusion of Illinois' spring practices. The Illini added Murray State's Cole Rusk, an FCS Third Team All-American, in time for spring ball. Tight end was further addressed Monday with a commitment from Division II honorable mention All-American Carson Goda. The former Saint Anselm standout has one season of eligibility remaining. Rusk and Goda account will team up with Tanner Arkin and Henry Boyer at tight end for Illinois. Both Arkin and Boyer played sparingly for the Illini during the 2023 season. Goda played in 29 games the past three seasons at Saint Anselm. His honorable mention All-American honors came after he caught 48 passes for 566 yards and five touchdowns last fall. The Bradenton, Fla., native has 122 catches for 1,456 yards and 12 touchdowns in his career. Goda is one of 30 newcomers for Illinois heading into the 2024 season. That includes 15 high school prospects in the Class of 2024, four junior college transfers and now 11 transfers from four-year institutions.",

        "content": "Napoli defender Juan Jesus remains angry over the alleged racism scandal with Inter Milan’s Francesco Acerbi in the spring. Speaking at a conference against racism in football, via FCInterNews , the Brazilian reiterated his version of events, and expressed his anger at being made to “look like a liar” in the incident. One highly unfortunate incident during the Serie A season just gone took place during a match between Inter and Napoli., The incident in question occurred during an argument between Inter defender Acerbi, and his Napoli opposite number Jesus. The Partenopei player went over to the referee to state that Acerbi had used a racial slur towards him. There was subsequently an investigation into the incident. The finding of the Sporting Judge and Italian FA prosecutors was that there was no conclusive evidence that Acerbi had used racist language towards Jesus. That is not to say that the verdict was conclusive that Acerbi had not used discriminatory language. Only that there is no proof that he had done so, apart from Jesus’ word. For his part, Napoli and former Inter and Roma defender Jesus has remained adamant. He has stuck to his story. And Acerbi as well has insisted that he never used any racial slurs, and that Jesus had misheard him. Juan Jesus Still Angry Over Francesco Acerbi Racism Row: “Made To Look Like A Liar” After being found not guilty of using racist language, Acerbi was allowed to return to the pitch. Therefore, the Italian international made appearances in Inter’s last ten matches of the season. That does not mean that the incident does not continue to cast an unpleasant shadow. Particularly given the undeniable fact that racism and discrimination are still problems in football. Napoli defender Jesus said that “I tried to be the better man at the end of the match.” The 32-year-old had initially said that “What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch” during his post-match remarks. Jesus said that Acerbi had apologized. And that he had forgiven the 36-year-old Inter defender. The Napoli defender continued that “My career speaks for itself. I’ve always acted correctly.” Jesus said that “He wanted to deny what I was saying, even though I’d protected him, going to great lengths to do so.” “Being made to look like a liar seemed like a distortion of the situation to me,” Jesus lamented.",

        "content": "ALEX BRUMMER: Copper displaces diamonds as Anglo American puts De Beers up for sale By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Updated: 22:00 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Diamonds have been the core of Anglo American since the modern company was created by Ernest Oppenheimer nearly a century ago. In an industry where brands stand for little, De Beers is the great exception. Its products have inspired generations of young people embarking on married life, and the gems remain the sparkling star of movies and legends. As glamorous as De Beers has been, with its arresting 1947 catchphrase ‘A diamond from a mine is forever,’ the company is now up for sale. The allure of diamonds has been surpassed by the work-a-place copper – a metal less regarded than more decorative rivals such as platinum, silver and gold. In demand: Copper prices have climbed 20% this year touching a record of $11,000-a-tonne this month The drive towards a greener, carbon-free economy has changed all of that. Copper prices have climbed 20 per cent this year touching a record of $11,000-a-tonne this month. Some traders predict a glorious future for the reddish metal with the value perhaps quadrupling to $40,000-a-tonne. There is a history of speculators seeking to making a fortune out of copper. In the 1990s Japanese bank Sumitomo lost $2.6billion (£2billion) at the hands of disgraced trader Yasuo Hamanaka. Giants of the mining world are seeking to double down on the metal. The proposed disposal of De Beers by Anglo American, as it seeks to defend itself from a three times assault by Australian mining behemoth BNP, is all about copper.

The conductivity of copper makes it critical to the world as it moves towards more electric vehicles, solar and nuclear energy. Copper mania has left De Beers and diamonds as an orphan asset in a mining world where metals are the real stars. Sparklers hold a special place in Western culture and De Beers has for decades had a granite grip on supplies. It has stood at the apex of a trade dominated by the cutters and dealers from the Hasidic Jewish community, based in Hatton Garden in London, Antwerp and Tel Aviv. A window on the occluded culture recently was offered by the Netflix series Rough Diamonds. Anglo’s going-it-alone strategy requires it to sell De Beers in the hope of raising up to £5billion through a trade sale or by doing the splits and listing the shares in London. The challenge for De Beers is how to preserve the rarity and cache of mined diamonds. Last year Anglo wrote down the value of its diamond operation by £1.3billion to £6billion as sales of its rough diamonds plummeted by 18 per cent. Sales have been hit by lower demand from The US and China. The real villain of the piece are laboratory stones. These lab diamonds are said to be virtually indistinguishable from their mined cousins and have grabbed around 20 per cent of the American market alone. Danish jeweller Pandora is among the fashion brands to embrace the newcomer, which sell for a fraction of the price of the real thing and carry less of the stigma which comes with the mined variety. De Beers itself has Lightbox, its own lab grown offshoot embraced in an effort to maintain its market control. The challenge for the next owners of De Beers is how to make its product distinguishable from the lab grown variety. One possibility is a marketing arrangement with a luxury goods group such as Tiffany or Cartier where forces could be combined to market diamonds around the idea of ‘real’ or ‘original’. The cost of such a campaign would be expensive. But it is not impossible as the surging price of hand-made Swiss watches demonstrates. Many of these high priced items have diamond enhanced movements and encrusted cases. In contrast to the struggles of diamonds the allure of copper, amid surging global demand, has never been greater.

        "content": "Jaylen Brown doesn’t appear to trust Stephen A. Smith’s sources. “It’s not so much that he’s underrated, it’s just that he’s not liked because of his I-am-better-than attitude,” Smith explained of Brown on First Take last week, reading a text message on the show from what the ESPN host described as an “NBA source.” “He knows it,” Smith continued, reading the text message. “‘It’s the same reason that he is not as marketable as he should be,’ that’s what an NBA source just sent me.” Brown replied back to the clip of Smith reading the text messages on X, writing , “State your source.” NBA legend and Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas also responded on X to Smith . “I have been a friend, mentor and advisor to @FCHWPO since he was a student at UC Berkeley he is 100 percent marketable and before you slander his name @stephenasmith tell your source to put their name on it or don’t speak on it. Let it be known.” This isnt the first time that Brown’s reputation has been called into question, too. In 2016, during the lead up to the NBA draft, Brown, who made the rare decision of entering the draft without an agent, was called “too smart for the league” by another nameless NBA executive via Andscape . Here is the video Isiah Thomas was upset at Stephen A about. He read a text from a “NBA SOURCE” that says people don’t like Jaylen Brown because he has a big ego and that’s why he’s not marketable. pic.twitter.com/oBz8ouXjwc Thomas was entrusted as a mentor to Brown during this time, instead of hiring an agent. “I am who I am. Take it or leave it,” Brown said after the report came out. “I’m not going to change my values and change my approach because someone feels uncomfortable. I am not going to be disrespectful or step on any toes. But I am going to be me.” Brown was said to be taking a graduate school-level class as a freshman at Cal, according to multiple reports at the time. “It’s not malicious,” the Andscape report continued. “He just wants to know what is going on. Old-school coaches don’t want guys that question stuff.” Brown challeneged that report two years later when asked about it at the Rising Stars Challenge. “What is the so-called mold of a basketball player?” Brown contested in Feb. 2018, via Boston.com . “I challenge whoever has the ideal or the ideology of a ‘so-called basketball player,’ I challenge them to come out and say what that is.” Brown has challenged these anonymous sources for years, but all of it has remained nameless. He’s been extremely successful since then, as the second leading scorer for Boston coming in at 24.7 points per game and having them on the brink of the team’s second NBA Finals berth in his career.",

Lakshmi, who in 2023 after 17 years of hosting, previously opened up about how the cooking competition series made it hard to stay in shape. “When filming , I consume about 5,000 to 8,000 calories a day,” she wrote in a June 2020 . “We start with anywhere from 15 to 18 contestants, and I have to take a bite or two from each of their plates to adequately judge each dish. Every day. It adds up. I typically gain anywhere from 10 to 17 pounds every season. Once I get home, what’s taken me six weeks to gain takes me 12 weeks to take off.” Lakshmi went on to detail her process for losing the extra weight before the Emmy Awards each year. (The television personality has received a staggering 16 Emmy nominations for .) “My diet for the Emmys is pretty straightforward. It’s like a poem: no meat, no wheat, no cheese, no fried foods or sweets. And, of course, no alcohol,” she wrote, adding that she supplemented the strict diet with “two hours of working out a day.” However, after realizing that her daughter, Krishna, now 14, was picking up her dieting habits, Lakshmi decided to change her approach. “This year, I’ve decided my weight will not be my focus. If I need a bigger dress, so be it,” she wrote. “That one day — or any day — on the red carpet isn’t nearly as important as making sure my daughter doesn’t measure her worth by her dress size.” Lakshmi, who shares Krishna with ex , wished her daughter a happy 14th birthday via in February. “There are thousands of words I could say about how proud I am to be your mother and to watch you grow. Happy birthday to my #littlehands!” she wrote alongside several throwback photos of the pair. The model has said that wanting more time with Krishna contributed to . “[It was] about having a personal life, to be honest, and also being present for my daughter — she’s a teenager,” she said during an August 2023 appearance on ’s “Awards Circuit” podcast. “In five years, she’s going to go off and have her own life and hopefully go to college and stuff.

Since Pep Guardiola arrived at the Etihad in 2016, the Spaniard has overseen a period of dominance, with City winning 17 trophies during his tenure, including four successive Premier League titles. As a result, they have faced criticism for being 'boring', with many fans and pundits fed up of the lack of competition in England, although City did suffer a shock FA Cup final defeat to Man United at the weekend. And, speaking on Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off podcast , Sutton said people are bored of Guardiola's side because they are 'so good' and said those that accuse them of having a 'boring' style of play are just 'jealous'. Ladyman agreed with his co-host, as he labelled City 'monsters', although he did point to the fact that some people prefer watching teams who 'get it forward quickly with a bit more crash-bang-wallop'.

        "content": "Beloved Shiba Inu dog Kabosu has passed away in its sleep after dominating the meme sector for over a decade as the face behind Dogecoin (DOGE). The crypto community is mourning the death of Kabosu as the dog had inspired the rise of several other meme coins aside from Dogecoin (DOGE). At the same time, many in the crypto community are excited about an Ethereum (ETH) token ETFswap (ETFS), whose presale event is promising early investors automatic yield. Let’s see how that is possible. ETFSwap (ETFS): A Unique ETF Trading Platform ETFswap (ETFS) is a crypto ETF trading platform that introduces a unique method of trading exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through the tokenization of assets. The tokenized version of the ETF will directly represent its traditional counterpart on the blockchain, giving room to closely monitor the assets before making any investment decision. The ETFs will be available for trading on a Web3 marketplace equipped with 24/7 liquidity and trading tools, which will assist traders in making the best use of the assets. One such trading tool is the ETF Filter, which will help investors save time by narrowing down their ETF choices when they apply specific parameters like asset classes, regions, and fund domicile. However, knowing which parameters to use could be hard without adequate knowledge about ETFs. That is why ETFswap (ETFS) will also introduce the ETFswap Screener, a crypto ETF index whose function is to educate users on exchange-traded funds and how to classify them accurately. At the center of ETFswap (ETFS) is its native token ETFS , a standard ERC-20 and deflationary token that will serve the purpose of utility, unlocking all the unique features on the platform, including trading tokenized ETFs. The token will also give holders voting rights to participate in the network governance. As the key to its ecosystem, ETFswap (ETFS) currently offers ETFS to all in the crypto community at a low price of $0.00854 per coin in its stage 1 presale event. By stage 2, the token price will briefly increase to $0.01831, resulting in automatic profit for all stage 1 investors. Further experts speculate that ETFS will soon surge to the $3 mark after launch and listing. Crypto Market Mourns Kabosu, The Shiba Inu Dog Behind The Dogecoin Logo Japanese Shiba Inu dog Kabosu passed away at the age of 18 on May 24, 2024, in its sleep from liver disease and leukemia, as reported by its owner, Atsuko Sako, on her blog Kabochan . Kabosu was first diagnosed with the illness in 2022 and has been struggling with it ever since. Sako had adopted Kabosu from a puppy mill in 2008, and in 2010, she took a picture of her pet spreading its paws on a sofa chair. She initially posted the photo on her blog, but it reached a Reddit forum where it became a meme circulated from office email chains to college dorm rooms. Eventually, the picture of the Shiba Inu dog became an NFT artwork and sold for $4 million, but more interestingly, it served as a stepping stone to the rise of Dogecoin (DOGE), the 8th most important cryptocurrency in the crypto market. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) founders started it as a joke, a payment system with no serious value, but it eventually evolved into a token with several use cases. Dogecoin (DOGE) has received backing from musical artists like Snoop Dogg and world-renowned billionaire Elon Musk, who has been its biggest fan. Last year, Elon changed the face of Twitter, now rebranded to X to the Dogecoin (DOGE) icon. Also, in April 2024, its EV maker company Tesla officially integrated DOGE as the payment option on its website. In November 2023, an organization dedicated to Dogecoin (DOGE) unveiled a $100,000 statue of Kabosu and her sofa at a park in Sakura, Japan. Further, Dogecoin (DOGE) cofounder Billy Markus, known on X as Shibetoshi Nakamoto, has paid tribute to Kabosu in an X post on the day the iconic Shiba Inu dog passed away. Conclusion The death of Kabosu caused grief for many in the crypto community, but ETFswap (ETFS) offers consolation with its presale event, which promises automatic yield on investment and its unique method of trading ETFs.

        "content": "Czech Sphinx will cut up to 1,000 Royal Mail jobs if £3.5bn takeover goes ahead, union bosses warn By Jessica Clark Updated: 22:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Union bosses have warned the ‘Czech Sphinx’ could press ahead with plans to cut up to 1,000 posties if he succeeds in his bid to buy Royal Mail. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) is set to hold talks with the billionaire businessman Daniel Kretinsky in early June if a deal goes ahead. Kretinsky has until 5pm on Wednesday to make a firm offer for Royal Mail owner International Distribution Services (IDS) or walk away. It comes after the IDS board said it would back his £3.5billion offer, which sparked an immediate backlash from campaigners, unions and politicians. CWU director general for post Martin Walsh told the Mail: ‘We are sceptical of Royal Mail and we are sceptical of Kretinsky’s firm. We will be looking for commitments on jobs.’ Deadline: Daniel Kretinsky (pictured) has until 5pm on Wednesday to make a firm offer for Royal Mail owner IDS It comes as Kretinsky, the billionaire co-owner of West Ham United football club, has backed Royal Mail’s reform proposals, which would lead to ‘fewer than 1,000’ voluntary redundancies. These plans include cutting second-class post to three days a week, paving the way for redundancies to save around £300million a year. Kretinsky has said he would protect workers’ rights and keep the Royal Mail brand, as well as its UK base and tax residence. But he has been tight-lipped on job losses and second-class post – suggesting cuts remain on the agenda. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ALEX BRUMMER: Copper displaces diamonds as Anglo American...

IDS has urged the government and regulators to make changes, saying the obligation costs Royal Mail up to £675million a year.

        "content": "Speaking to via , the 24-year-old stated that he has held talks with Arsenal and that they have agreed that a transfer this summer is best for the Belgian’s career. “My time at Arsenal is slowly coming to the end,” Lokonga said. “I had a discussion with the club and what was said is that the best solution for me was to leave.” Lokonga has been at the North London club since 2021 and has made 39 appearances for the Gunners, with the majority of those coming within the 2021/22 campaign. The Belgian would spend time on loan at Crystal Palace and with Luton Town this season, but it sounds like his next club will be a permanent one. The midfielder impressed at Luton this season when fit but his campaign was ultimately hampered by injuries. Lokonga played in 17 Premier League games for the Hatters, scoring one goal alongside three assists. Leaving Arsenal is the right move for Albert Sambi Lokonga Arsenal is a very different place from when Lokonga joined the Premier League giants in 2021 as the Gunners are once again one of the best teams in England. The Belgian simply is not good enough to be part of Mikel Arteta’s team and there would be very few minutes for him at the Emirates given the talent they have at the club in midfield. A permanent transfer is best for the 24-year-old as he is still very young. It remains to be seen where Lokonga ends up for the 2024/25 campaign, but his performances at Luton this season have shown that there is potential in the Arsenal star.",

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are — including , , and — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a in the state.",

        "content": "The historic Lorain-Sandusky Tornado of 1924 officially will mark its centennial June 28, but much like the event itself, the impact will be felt for months to come. Throughout the summer, the Lorain Historical Society, 329 W. 10th St. in Lorain, will host a number of events revolving around the tornado. The string of events officially will kick off June 28 with the remembrance ceremony, according to the Historical Society’s website. “This remembrance event will honor the victims and survivors of the 1924 Lorain tornado inside the Lakeview Park Bath House which was where the tornado first made landfall in Lorain,” the Historical Society said. “Directly following the event, join the Lorain County Metro Parks on a guided ‘Tornado Walking Tour’ around 1 p.m. through the park.” Later that evening, the Historical Society will host a second, smaller acknowledgement during the Lorain International Festival. Businesses and clubs around the city of Lorain have scheduled events throughout the summer to remember the victims and survivors of the tornado. To bring awareness to the subsequent rebuilding of the city, the Historical Society has partnered with businesses around the city. “To honor the 100th anniversary of the 1924 Lorain tornado, local organizations are working together to remember the victims and survivors of the tornado and promote awareness around the rebuilding and rebirth that followed,” the Historical Society said. It has supplied five Lorain-based small businesses with exclusive tornado-themed postcards in anticipation of the event. Those looking for extras can find the five card set at the Historical Society’s gift shop. “Visit the Ariel Broadway Hotel, Broadway Mary’s, Magdalen’s Gallery + Espresso, Nielsen’s Jewelers and Speak of the Devil Cocktail Bar to collect each postcard,” the website said. “We’re working together to promote the resilience of our community during that time, and now.” The Historical Society has partnered with Main Street Lorain during its Second Saturday events this summer. Also, the Historical Society will give tornado walking tours throughout each event from June to September. Additionally, this year’s annual stamp show Nov. 23, hosted by the Black River Stamp Club, will revolve around the tornado’s anniversary. Stamp enthusiasts can purchase an exclusive cachet and postmark at the show. The Historical Society also built an online database of photographs and information about the tornado which is open to the public. “Lorain Historical Society volunteers have been describing and digitizing the extensive collection of tornado photographs, postcards, and documents for the public to view and explore online,” the website said. “Volunteers have done their best to identify exact locations of images in the collection.” Currently, the Historical Society is looking for more photos and other tornado memorabilia for the online collection. Those looking to have their pieces included in the database, can visit www.lorainhistory.org/tornado-commemoration for more information.",

        "description": "SAPPORO — Local governments across the country are relaxing regulations regarding outdoor saunas, such as installing fencing to separate men and women, in order for people to enjoy saunas as an open space attraction among natural surroundings.",
        "content": "By Kotaro Yaginuma and Asuka Kaji / Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writers 6:00 JST, May 28, 2024 SAPPORO — Local governments across the country are relaxing regulations regarding outdoor saunas, such as installing fencing to separate men and women, in order for people to enjoy saunas as an open space attraction among natural surroundings. The central government is also encouraging local municipalities to adopt flexible requirements, looking forward to outdoor saunas as one of the new tourist attraction. A 39-year-old company employee enjoyed Kielo Sauna in the middle of a forest in Kushiro, Hokkaido. “After sweating comfortably, I can soak up a feeling of openness while taking in the natural environment,” he said enthusiastically. Most saunas are indoors, and local governments have previously instructed operators to build fences and have separate facilities for men and women in the same way as public hot baths. However, many people have complained that these restrictions would result in the loss of a sense of unity with nature, one of the greatest attractions of outdoor saunas. Last autumn, the Hokkaido prefectural government significantly eased regulations on saunas, removing the mandatory requirement for fences and divided facilities. Hokkaido government requires sauna operators to install drainage systems, but for events such as ones using “tent saunas,” it allows them to install makeshift facilities “We hope these measures will help reduce hurdles to operating saunas,” said Yosuke Goto, the president of the Tokachi Sauna Association. Yamanashi Prefecture, which calls itself the “outdoor sauna sanctuary,” revised an ordinance in 2022 to allow both men and women to enter a sauna together if they wear bathing suits. Aiming to ease regulations across the country, the prefectural government in January asked the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry to review hygiene management guidelines for public baths. “If people and companies can get into the sauna business more easily, more people will know about outdoor saunas,” said an official at the prefectural government. “We want saunas to become a new tourism resource for Yamanashi Prefecture,” The National Federation of Public Bath Industry Trade Unions conducted a survey on 157 municipalities that have public health centers under their jurisdiction. As of the end of January, 39 municipalities, or 24.8%, have eased restrictions on the installation of saunas. The health ministry informed prefectural governments and other entities of the survey results along with examples of deregulation and asked for flexible measures to be implemented. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency plans to review the criteria that defines the distances between surrounding walls and heat sources such as stoves. The current criteria is aimed at indoor installations, so the agency will conduct an experiment within this fiscal year to measure an appropriate distance. Dai Matsuo, who produces saunas across the country, welcomed the moves to ease regulations. “There is growing demand to enjoy saunas along with nature, like in Finland, the home of the sauna,” he said.",

        "content": "GRAND FORKS — Thompson senior Brayden Wolfgram had no idea how many high school baseball games he had earned the pitching victory in during his Tommies career. However, it was easy to recall how many losses Wolfgram has earned. Zero. The 5-foot-10 right-hander takes a 16-0 career pitching record into this weekend's North Dakota Class B state baseball tournament in Jamestown. The Tommies, searching for a third-consecutive state title, open the tournament Thursday against Surrey at 11:30 a.m. ADVERTISEMENT Wolfgram would like to add one more pitching win to his record this weekend. \"That'd be pretty awesome, knowing you haven't lost a game,\" Wolfgram said. \"I've had situations like this year in Hillsboro where I could have picked up the loss but (Drew) Odenbach came in and closed it out and helped me out. \"That's part of it, too. You have to trust your teammates. I don't blow it past kids, but I trust my defense enough to make the plays. I have one of the best shortstops in the state. Trusting your defense and throwing strikes is a big part of Thompson baseball.\" Wolfgram, who's committed to play college baseball at Concordia in Moorhead next season, is 8-0 this year. In 41 innings pitched, he has 51 strikeouts and a 0.85 earned-run average. \"He's effective with where he throws it,\" Thompson coach Nate Soulis said. \"He keeps you off balance with four pitches. His fastball gets by you if you're thinking something else. Even if you're sitting fastball, he can spot it up where it'll take a good swing and a good hitter to do damage on it.\" Wolfgram has had help this year on the hill for the Tommies. Odenbach is 5-0 with 53 strikeouts in 38 innings with a 1.84 ERA. Brody Gibson is 3-0 with a 1.00 ERA across 28 innings. Wolfgram is also batting a team-high .457. Thompson's top nine hitters are all batting better than .300 on the year. \"He's taken it to another level,\" Soulis said. \"This is his fourth year starting. I don't know what his secret sauce is this year but he's confident. The teammates feel it and the coaches feel it. When he's up, you know he's going to hit it hard. When he's pitching, our guys know we have our best on the mound and history shows we have a good chance to win.\" ADVERTISEMENT This year will be an eighth-straight season (the state tournament was wiped out by COVID-19 in 2020) the Tommies will be at the state tournament. As a freshman, Wolfgram was a starter when the Tommies lost to Langdon-Edmore-Munich in the state semifinals. \"We had four or five kids on this team who were on that team,\" Wolfgram said. \"That moment ... you don't want to do that again. The last two years have been fun. We've set a pretty high standard here at Thompson, especially for baseball.\" Wolfgram said some opponents could tell Thompson's goal extended beyond the region tournament. \"Other places have said it doesn't look like we're having fun at the region tournament,\" Wolfgram said. \"That's just not our goal anymore. We've been lucky enough to set that goal for ourselves. We understand there are good teams in our region, and it's no walk-by, but you have to understand there's a bigger goal.\" Coach: Nate Soulis. Record: 23-1. State tournament matchup: No. 1 Thompson vs. Surrey, 11:30 a.m., Thursday, in Jamestown ADVERTISEMENT Top hitters: Sr. P-IF Brayden Wolfgram .457, 6 2Bs, 31 RBIs; jr.

        "content": "The mother of three of the girls who were injured during a stabbing at a Braintree movie theater Saturday evening is thanking the first responders and doctors who helped her daughters. Lisa Dembowski’s daughters were among the four girls stabbed by a man inside a theater at AMC’s Braintree location in an unprovoked attack. Martha’s Vineyard resident Jared Ravizza, 26, is now being investigated as a suspect in the stabbing after being arrested in connection with a stabbing at a Plymouth McDonald’s that happened shortly after Dembowksi’s daughters were attacked. Dembow took to Facebook Monday morning to thank the police officers and firefighters who responded to the stabbing, saying that they calmed both her daughters and herself. “Our first responders are incredible people,” she wrote. Dembowski also thanked the medical team that took care of her daughters at Boston Medical Center after they were taken there by ambulance. They “went above and beyond to not only make sure [her daughters] were physically OK but made them feel safe.” “They see it all and have to be exhausted and yet were at the ready for whatever we needed. Our friends and family, the community — thank you,” she wrote. Dembowski recounted what happened during the stabbing to WCVB on Sunday , explaining that three of the girls — aged 9 to 17 — were her daughters, and the fourth was their friend. They were the only people in the theater when a man came up behind them and stabbed them — laughing the whole time. The suspect stabbed Dembowski’s oldest daughter in the back, stabbed another of her daughters in the chest and stabbed the third in the arm, she told WCVB. Braintree police said previously that all the girls’ wounds were non-life-threatening, but the mother said her children are shaken and never want to go to the movies again. “Kids are resilient, but I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night and this could happen,” she said. “Someone could just walk into a movie theater and do this with no knowledge of who they were.” AMC said in a statement to WCVB that it would be adding additional security at the theater. McDonald’s issued a statement on the Plymouth stabbing to MassLive Monday night. “We are shocked and devastated by this senseless act of violence. The safety of our crew and customers is always our top priority.

Police and emergency services rushed to the scene on Langrick Road in Lincolnshire just before 1.20pm on Saturday. Mr Long was declared dead at the scene. An RAF spokesperson said a temporary pause is in place while an investigation into the incident is ongoing. Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby. Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C — The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) May 25, 2024 “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” the spokesperson said. RAF Coningsby is home to the BBMF, a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. Only a few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six that belong to the BBMF. On Saturday, the Prince and Princess of Wales said on their Kensington Palace X account: “Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby. “Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C.” William was Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Coningsby from 2008 to August 2023, when he handed the role over to Kate.",

That would be the \"No Mow May\" movement. Many people are trying to help the bee population across the state by skipping mowing their lawns this month so the bees have more places to pollinate. READ MORE: ARE MASSIVE \"SUMMER SNOW\" STORMS COMING TO NY? Feel Good Mornings With Dave Fields Several cities across the country joined the \"No Mow May\" movement and encouraged residents to keep their lawnmowers quiet during the month of May.

READ MORE: MAY FORECASTED TO BE WARMER AND DRIER THAN NORMAL By not mowing in the month of May you are allowing floral resources that may be hard to find, to be available for the bees. By allowing your lawn and the flowers on it to grow longer and bloom, your lawn can provide the nectar and pollen to help bees in your area thrive. If you can't or don't want to go the whole month without mowing, maybe reduced the number of times you mow the lawn in the month.

        "content": "The actor, Johnny Wactor, was in downtown on Saturday. Johnny was 37 years old. He saved the life of his female co-worker in an act of heroism by putting his body between her and armed car thieves. Before his death, Johnny posted on Instagram on July 2, 2022 that he was . In the video, Johnny is seen smiling while angling the camera to just his face. He said: \"Look, I'm making a movie with friends. It's written by a friend. My friends are in it. We're all producing it. We're making this independently, which means we're paying for it out of our own pocket.\" He continued: \"We've got the majority of the money we need raised but we just need a little extra help to make it as good as it can be. It is an awesome story. It's hilarious. It's dark. Unfortunetly, it's about cancer but, on that note, any of the proceeds that we make after distribution will go to a cancer charity of your choice. It's a tax write off and it will be for a good cause.\" The film was named, American Sognare, and released in 2022. It starred , , , and Johnny himself. His followers went back to the video and sent their condolences after hearing about his passing. One person wrote: \"I didn’t know Johnny, but my deepest condolences to his family and friends.\" Another person wrote: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time [prayer hands emoji] May they find comfort and strength in their memories and the love that surrounds them.\"A third person wrote: Rest in eternal peace [prayer hands emoji] you were a great actor. GOD BLESS YOU!! PRAYERS TO YOUR FAMILY.\" Many of the comments were of people feeling \"sad\" when watching the 2022 video. All of this comes after Johnny saw three men near his vehicle at 3:25 a.m. on Saturday. At first, he thought they were towing his car, but they'd actually been trying to steal Johnny's catalytic converter. When Johnny approached the men about the car, one of the men then pointed a gun at the actor. Johnny put his body in front of his female co-worker and was shot. The masked thieves then fled the scene in another vehicle but Johnny was pronounced dead at the hospital after getting taken from pararamedics. His mother, Scarlett Wactor shared a in honor of her son. The GoFundMe was set up by Michaelle Kinard, Johnny's godmother. She wrote on the page: \"On May 25, my dearest and best friend’s son was murdered. He was the victim of the most senseless crime!\"",

The audience booed the 45th President some more.",
        "content": "Former President and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump made an appeal to Libertarian Party voters over the weekend that, despite its fairly historic nature, likely did not go as planned for the 45th President. Trump joined the nation’s third largest political party for their national convention in Washington on Saturday, just a day after independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the group with somewhat mixed results , when the former president called on the party to back his second try for a second term. “Everyone here tonight believes that we must fight for the same fundamental freedoms — freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of the right to own a firearm, and freedom from over-taxation,” Trump said . Kennedy was nominated to potentially join the party’s presidential ticket, an “ unexpected honor ” he accepted. A party delegate tried to nominate Trump, the first former president to address the Libertarian National Convention in the party’s history, but the Republican was disqualified from nomination by party officials over his failure to file nomination papers. His appearance at the event and direct appeal to the party members for their nomination or their vote, it’s fair to say, was not well received. Ahead of Trump’s arrival, a party delegate made a motion “to go tell Donald Trump to go f*** himself,” which despite not being carried by a vote was met with loud applause. Trump entered the convention floor to the sound of Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” and singing fans didn’t quite manage to drown out the very audible displeasure of some delegates. When Trump did take the stage under the party’s “Become Ungovernable” event banner, he was met with loud jeers. “I am truly honored to be invited here tonight as the first president in American history to address the Libertarian National Convention, great honor,” Trump said. Many in the audience responded with boos. “MAGA = Socialists,” a sign held by one man read. “In the last year, I’ve been indicted by the government on 91 different things. If I wasn’t a Libertarian before, I sure as hell am a Libertarian now,” he said. The audience responded with more boos. “Combine with us, you have to combine with us. We cannot give crooked Joe Biden four more years,” Trump said. The audience booed. So loud and frequent was the booing that Trump was forced to stop speaking several times . Trump’s reception wasn’t entirely terrible. There were times when his supporters among the party managed to lead in the crowd in a “we want Trump” chant, and the audience responded with applause when he said he would commute the prison sentence of Ross Ulbricht . Ulbricht was arrested in 2013 in connection with his creation of the dark web site known as Silk Road, which the Department of Justice demonstrated was used to move illegal drugs and involved in human trafficking. Ulbricht, 40, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 over a long list of charges including narcotics distribution, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and computer hacking crimes. Many Libertarians believe that all drugs should be made legal. Trump told the crowd, many of whom carried “Free Ross” signs, that if he’s elected, he will commute Ulbricht’s sentence on the first day of his second term. The former president also received applause when he promised “that I will put a Libertarian in my cabinet, and also, Libertarians in senior posts” and when he proclaimed “to the nation‘s 50 million crypto holders, I say this, with your vote I will keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin.” When Trump said again the Libertarian Party should nominate him or at least cast their votes for him this November, the audience loudly booed. “Whoa! That’s nice. That’s nice,” Trump said, clearly taken aback. They should nominate him, “only if they want to win,” he told them next, attempting to speak over their displeasure. “If you want to lose don’t do that — keep getting your 3% every four years,” Trump said. The audience booed the 45th president some more. 38-year-old former Georgia congressional candidate Chase Oliver won the Libertarian nomination late Sunday after seven rounds of voting. Trump and RFK Jr. were eliminated in the first round.",

        "content": "The Indianapolis 500 purse record was shattered for the third year in a row after the weather-delayed 108th Running of the Indianapolis 500, with two-time race winner Josef Newgarden of Team Penske earning $4.288 million from a total purse of $18,456,000. After record-breaking payouts in 2022 and ’23, this is the largest purse and largest winner’s payout in the century-plus history of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The year’s average payout for NTT IndyCar Series drivers was $543,000, which also exceeds last year’s average of $500,600. In 2023, the Indianapolis 500 purse was $17,021,500, and the year’s winner payout was $3.666 million. In 2022, the Indianapolis 500 purse was $16,000,200, and the winner earned $3.1 million. Prior to 2022, the largest Indianapolis 500 purse was $14.4 million for the 2008 Indianapolis 500. Second-place finisher Pato O’Ward of Arrow McLaren Racing took home $1,050,500, exceeding the take-home prize for last year’s second-place finisher. ‘“The Indianapolis 500 is the greatest race in the world, and this record-breaking purse is reflective of just how monumental competing in and winning at Indy is for these drivers,” Penske Entertainment President and CEO Mark Miles said. “Despite weather challenges, the Month of May featured packed grandstands and intense on-track action. Presenting this purse is the ideal end cap to an epic month.” NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Larson earned Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year honors for his performance during the Month of May. Larson, driving for Arrow McLaren, made his first attempt to complete “The Double,” by racing both the Indianapolis 500 and the NASCAR Cup Series Coca-Cola 600. Larson earned a $50,000 bonus for being named Rookie of the Year, adding to a total take-home prize of $178,000. More IndyCar! Daly stars after frustrating run up to Indy Team Chevy conquers all at Indy McLaughlin drained after giving it his all at Indy The Indianapolis 500 purse consists of Indianapolis Motor Speedway and NTT IndyCar Series awards, plus other designated and special awards. Purse awards are presented annually at the Victory Celebration, held this year at the JW Marriott in downtown Indianapolis Monday night. Newgarden’s purse included a $440,000 roll-over bonus from BorgWarner for earning back-to-back Indy 500 wins. The jackpot increases by $20,000 each year but has only been awarded one other time since its inception when Helio Castroneves won the Indy 500 in both 2001 and ’02.",

        "content": "Queensland skipper Daly Cherry-Evans says the axing of former NSW captain James Tedesco \"sucks\" because he has been in the same position and understands the pain. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading On the flip side it is a bittersweet moment as Jake Trbojevic, his soulful, competitive Manly teammate and great friend, has become NSW skipper instead. Cherry-Evans, 35, and 30-year-old Trbojevic will go head-to-head in an old-fashioned 'mate v mate' State of Origin confrontation in Sydney on June 5 in the State of Origin series opener. \"That theme hasn't necessarily disappeared but it has been a bit hard to lean into a bit lately, without those sort of rivalries,\" Maroons half Cherry-Evans said. \"But two (Origin) captains each coming from the same club is as good as it gets,\" The pair mark the first club teammates to captain opposing states since 2000, when Sydney Roosters duo Brad Fittler and Adrian Lam led NSW and Queensland. Cherry-Evans is also a good friend of Tedesco, shares the same management company, and has represented Australia alongside him. The 2011 premiership winner was dropped in 2015 from the Maroons and spent three years in the Origin wilderness. So news of 31-year-old fullback Tedesco's axing in favour of Penrith's Dylan Edwards - after Tedesco and Cherry-Evans had contested four consecutive Origin series against each other as opposition captains - hit home. \"That's hard because I have been there before. I have been dropped from Queensland and it sucks,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"There are really no words to explain it because we as footy players want to keep doing it forever and ever. \"I'm not here to say the door is shut on Teddy to play for the Blues ever again but obviously it hurts initially. \"They have ... gone with Dylan. Madge (NSW coach Michael Maguire) is obviously not afraid to make the moves that he thinks will put them in the best position. \"As a friend of Teddy's, it was definitely disappointing.\" Cherry-Evans explained his mixed emotions in a nutshell. \"Teddy gets dropped and my current teammate becomes captain. It is hard not to be really happy and proud for Jake for how hard he has worked and his perseverance as a footy player,\" Cherry-Evans said. \"He continually rocks up and plays good footy each week and it is amazing to see where he is now. He is NSW captain.\" It is why Cherry-Evans expects to face a NSW side, led by middle forward Trbojevic, that will give no quarter. \"He is a win-at-all-costs player. Jake doesn't have a good poker face,\" Cherry-Evans grinned. \"That is the best way to explain it. If (Manly) have lost, he is not happy. With the wins, he rides them just as hard as anyone else. I am really proud of Jake. He has worked so hard and been super-competitive for a long time.\" Cherry-Evans said he had texted Trbojevic \"to say congrats\" but that they wouldn't speak again before the series opener.

        "content": "A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travellers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travellers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travellers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travellers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travellers will fly between June 1 and Aug. 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday – 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honour America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honours the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "Bat For Lashes has spoken to NME about how her upcoming sixth album ‘The Dream Of Delphi’ poses a “cosmic, raw, maternal look at love”. Previous Ivor and Mercury Prize nominee Natasha Khan – AKA Bat For Lashes – was in attendance at the Ivor Novellos on Thursday (May 23) to present the award for Best Film Score which was won by Jerskin Fendrix for Poor Things. “I love film,” she told NME on the red carpet. “I’ve made short films, I’ve got a film coming out next week, I’ve won an Ivor Novello for a BBC drama series soundtrack. As well as songwriting, it’s my other love: film, visuals, and sound.” Said new film on the horizon is to accompany Khan’s new album ‘The Dream Of Delphi’ – which is released on Friday (May 31). Explaining the inspiration of the record, she said: “It’s dedicated to my daughter, Delphi – who was born in 2020 in the middle of lockdown. It’s sort of a cosmic, raw, maternal look at love.” She continued: “It’s quite different stylistically to my other albums because it was mostly fully improvised. There’s a lot of arpeggios, harps, and strings. I just sat down and wrote songs in a day. I added basslines, beats, vocoders – then ran home to breastfeed! It’s definitely a potent, heightened, emotional record. There’s also a lot of space and soundtrack-esque, filmic music on there as well.” Speaking of her upcoming live dates, Khan promised “some contemporary dance and performance art aspects”. “I’ve been exploring movement with this album quite a lot,” she said. “It’s movement that incorporates domestic, mundane tasks into a kind of cosmic reverence and praise for life. “The stage show definitely has some theatrical elements, but then I’m also playing with Charlotte Hatherley who was in Ash, and Laura Groves again – so the three women get to rock out again on stage, so I’m really happy about that.” Khan also took to the time share her “Bruce Springsteen appreciation noise”, in honour of The Boss who was receiving the biggest award of the night. “I have a crush on him from the ‘70s – I don’t know if it will be the same sort of erotically-charged sound,” she joked. “But I’m a huge fan of his music – he’s a legend.” Check out the full list of winners from the Ivor Novellos 2024 here. Other highlights of the night included Bruce Springsteen winning the Ivor Fellowship Award (with a roasting from Sir Paul McCartney) and Lana Del Rey picking up the Special International Award. This comes after Khan released bittersweet new single ‘At Your Feet’. “I improvised this song, all the piano and vocoder parts, from start to finish”, said Khan. “The words are all about the hallucinatory state of being sleep deprived in the night, breastfeeding, rocking the baby: so tired, so aware that I almost have no say in this devotional nocturnal practice of caring for my child.” Bat For Lashes released ‘The Dream Of Delphi’ on May 31. Her upcoming 2024 UK tour dates are below, with tickets available here. Bat For Lashes’ 2024 UK tour dates are: JUNE 12 – O2 Academy 2, Oxford 18 – Town Hall, Birmingham 19 – Beacon, Bristol 24 – Barbican, London 25 – De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill On Sea 27 – Aviva Studios, Manchester Bat For Lashes last released an album in the form of 2019’s ‘Lost Girls’. In a four-star review, NME called the project her “most consistent work to date”, adding that Khan was “still dramatic, seductive and theatrical, but fully cut loose. This is Khan’s own heroic moment.” Publisher",

        "content": "On March 16, 2018, 28-year-old Kirti Vyas, a finance manager at BBlunt salon in Andheri, set off for work around 8.50 am from her residence in South Mumbai. She was supposed to take the 9.11 am train from Grant Road to Andheri in the western suburbs. That was the last day Kirti’s family members saw her. Six years after she went missing, two of Kirti’s colleagues were convicted Monday for murdering her . On March 16, 2018, around 11.30 am, Kirti’s mother attempted to contact her to know the WiFi password of their home Internet connection, to share it with a relative. However, Kirti’s phone was switched off. Advertisement Assuming she was busy at work, Kirti’s mother did not call her again. Read | How a bloodstain in a car led Mumbai police to solve a murder However, when Kirti did not return home by the usual time, her family attempted to reach her, but both her phone numbers remained unreachable. They contacted her HR Manager at B-Blunt, who confirmed that Kirti had not reported to work that day. In a bid to aid the family, Kirti’s manager enlisted the help of two colleagues, one of whom was Siddhesh Tamhankar, Kirti’s junior at B-Blunt. Advertisement The following day, the two colleagues visited Grant Road railway station to inquire if any regular commuters had seen Kirti. Simultaneously, the police began reviewing CCTV footage for clues. However, Kirti was not spotted at Grant Road or Andheri railway stations, and the building’s CCTV indicated she had left around 8:55 a.m. Kirti, a qualified chartered accountant and law graduate, had joined B-Blunt’s accounts department in 2012. B-Blunt, co-founded by Adhuna Bhabani, a celebrity hair stylist and former wife of actor-producer-director Farhan Akhtar, requested Akhtar and other celebrities to utilise social media in the quest for information on Kirti. Advertisement Later, Tamhankar disclosed a crucial detail to his colleagues and to the police about the day Kirti went missing. He claimed that he and another female colleague were en route to South Mumbai that day and offered Kirti a lift to work, which she initially accepted but later declined, expressing concern about traffic delays. When questioned by police about the delay in revealing this information, Tamhankar cited his relationship with the colleague, who was married, as the reason for his silence. The police alleged that Kirti had reprimanded Tamhankar at work for accounting errors and issued a warning, sparking suspicion. However, lacking concrete evidence against Tamhankar, the police continued their investigation for 50 days. Advertisement On May 6, 2018, the police claimed a breakthrough when a blood stain discovered in the car driven by the female accused matched Kirti’s parents’ DNA. Subsequently, Tamhankar and the female colleague were arrested. The police asserted that the pair engaged in a confrontation with Kirti after picking her up near her residence on March 16, 2018, resulting in her strangulation and subsequent disposal of her body in a creek in Wadala. Despite extensive search efforts using drones, local fishermen, and other means, no trace of Kirti was found. The police alleged that the accused were aware of tidal movements, preventing the body from resurfacing.",

For now. BREAKING: After two years of negotiations, an effort by the World Health Organization to agree on a global pandemic treaty has failed. Hallelujah! THIS is MASSIVE! Massive. A win for liberty and national sovereignty. good! Very, very good. pic.twitter.com/gaUnKQqp3u Pop the champagne, for sure. HUGE win! HUGE. Defund the WHO We agree. The WHO, the UN -- defund them all. When they’re done trying forever, that will be the victory. The WHO has got to go PERMANENTLY. Make no mistake -- they'll try again and keep trying. We must keep fighting and defeating them. Any time the WHO fails, it’s a win for humanity Humanity wins. Finally, a ray of light penetrates this dark time. A bright shining ray of light. Huge win!!! 🖕🏼the W.H.O. https://t.co/H8DZ8Y6lWS Amen. \"The Who\" - we don't get fooled again! https://t.co/Xsg1FtMRhb Excellent reference. No more global treaties, no more global organizations, no more entangling alliances, no more eroding of national sovereignty. The UN, WHO, and all of the NGOs who meddle in the internal affairs of nations for left wing ends need to be abolished https://t.co/CYD6M8eLXh We completely agree. The Left loves to scream about colonialism and invasions but welcomes this nonsense. No, thank you. This is huge. This treaty would have taken away all of our Sovereignty to make our own medical decisions. https://t.co/IuaZV6KFVS And we cannot allow that. Ever. What our own government did during COVID was bad enough. After four years of fighting the WHO agenda, our effort to thwart this #WHOPowerGrab has succeeded. https://t.co/qgZa1YsKb5 They'll revisit this again and again until they win. So stay vigilant. Fantastic news. The pending Community Note says they will keep pushing for a new agreement. Perhaps, but the longer the process takes, the more will be revealed about their failings. https://t.co/7bJ3S6eAH0 As we said -- this doesn't end here. It's a victory in this battle, not in the war.

        "content": "As the dust begins to settle on the 2024 Monaco Grand Prix, it is time to bring you up to speed with the major talking points. Red Bull has revealed just how badly their pockets have been hit after Sergio Perez crashed out in dramatic fashion alongside the Haas cars in Monaco, while photographers narrowly escaped getting caught up in the chaos, thankfully. Here is your post-Monaco Monday F1 news round-up... After being tagged by the Haas of Kevin Magnussen on the run up the hill out of Sainte Devote, Perez found himself pinballing between the barriers with only the survival cell of his Red Bull RB20 left intact. It was a huge relief to see Perez walk away unscathed. His Red Bull of course was far from unscathed, with senior advisor Helmut Marko claiming the cost of that shunt for the team is “two to three million”, which is far from ideal for Red Bull in the cost cap era.

Team boss Bruno Famin was fuming with Ocon, with Famin reportedly giving “serious” thought to benching Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix as a result.

Police and emergency services rushed to the scene on Langrick Road in Lincolnshire just before 1.20pm on Saturday. Mr Long was declared dead at the scene.

Only a few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six that belong to the BBMF.

        "content": "PHD has appointed Brendan Hewitt as its new Sydney head of strategy, replacing the outgoing Remi Baker . Baker has spent 11 years all up at PHD, joining in 2013 in the UK. She had a brief stint at Bauer Media in London in 2016, before relocating to Sydney in 2017 and rejoining PHD. In 2021, she was promoted to head of strategy. Hewitt, who begins in the role on 17 June, is an internal promotion. He has spent almost 15 years at the Omnicom media agency, working in strategy and innovation roles across New Zealand, and the UK, and with clients such as ANZ, Diageo, Volkswagen Group, and Unilever. Pia Coyle , PHD Australia Sydney managing director, said: “We are so happy to welcome Brendan to the PHD Sydney team. It’s an exciting new era at PHD, as we explore what it means to be at the cutting edge of where our smart and experienced people meet the world of assisted intelligence. “Brendan’s experience in a wide range of categories across many markets will really help drive our best thinking for our current and future clients.” Most recently group strategy director at PHD in Auckland, Hewitt said he was “chuffed” about the new role. “They’re a talented bunch, great people, and have a fantastic set of clients. It’s a dynamic time in the world of media and advertising, I’m excited to get stuck in and help take the agency and our partners forward.” Coyle also thanked Baker for her contributions to PHD. “I wanted to thank Remi on behalf of PHD, she has been a core part of the strategy team and wider agency. Her tenure speaks to her dedication and passion for what PHD does differently as an agency and we wish her well with her next opportunity.” Baker said of her time at PHD: “After 11 incredible years of growth, learning, and innovation at PHD, the time has come to embark on the next chapter of my career. “I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here, having learnt so much from some of the best and brightest in the industry and having made friendships that will truly last a lifetime. I’m excited for what’s next and wish PHD all the best for the future – I have no doubt Brendan will smash it.” – Top image: Brendan Hewitt",

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has added yet another record to his collection as he set a new high for goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season. The 39-year-old struck twice in Al-Nassr's 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park to take his total to 35, eclipsing Abderrazak Hamdallah's 34 from 2018-19. Hamdallah, who was also playing for Al-Nassr at the time, but is now with Al-Ittihad, could at least take some comfort from the fact that his haul came in just 27 league games, four fewer than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star's. Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil's long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club's final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb's penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer's strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho for the visitors ultimately saw Al-Nassr prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

        "content": "Shocking new border statistics reveal the surprising countries migrants are flocking to the US from San Diego border sees migrants from over 170 countries High number of Chinese migrants arriving in Southern California By Maryann Martinez, Texas Bureau Chief For Dailymail.Com Published: 22:00, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Shocking new border statistics have revealed the surprising countries spawning an influx of migrants to the US. While Chinese migrants continue to dominate the list, thousands are also pouring in from India, Vietnam, Turkey, Uzebakistan and the West African nation of Mauritania. About 62% of all Chinese migrants arriving at America's borders are entering the country through San Diego, according to US Border Patrol statistics. At least 48,501 Chinese migrants have crossed into the US illegally- mostly surrendering to Border Patrol with the hopes of seeking asylum- from Oct. 1 through April. Chinese migrants wait to be processed after crossing the border with Mexico Wednesday, May 8, 2024, near Jacumba Hot Springs, Calif. San Diego became the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in April, according to U.S. government data 'It’s an 8,600% increase over all of fiscal year 2021, when just 342 Chinese nationals crossed illegally - across the entire southern border,' Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin tweeted . NEW BORDER NUMBERS 48,501 - China 8,900 - India 7,800 - Turkey 2,900 - Uzbekistan 4,400 - Mauritania 3,000 - Vietnam 5,600 - Guinea Advertisement Of those, 27,135 entered the country either in San Diego or in the area east of the city, which is all considered the San Diego sector by the Border Patrol. On Saturday alone, at least 118 Chinese citizens illegally cross into the region, Fox News reported. While most of the border sees most of its migrants from countries like Mexico and Venezuela, the area near San Diego attracts migrants from around the world. Since the start of the fiscal year, more than 8,900 migrants from India have arrived there. Another 7,800 from Turkey, 5,600 from 5,600+ Guinea and 4,400 from Mauritania have also entered the country there. 'There is now an orchestrated, well organized cartel smuggling operation of Chinese into Southern California,' Melugin stated. As DailyMail.com was first to report, Chinese migrants are being smuggled into the US with the help of Chinese gangs known as 'snakeheads' who are operating in synchrony with Mexican cartels. Asian criminal organizations have been working in Mexico for many year in drug trade and money laundering, but have recently moved into human trafficking business as Chinese migrants have started showing up at the border, cartel expert Robert Almonte told DailyMail.com. 'The Chinese (smugglers) just can't go over there and cut the Mexican cartels out - that just doesn't happen. They've got to be paying the Mexican cartel some kind of a percentage, quota or tax,' he said. The global arrivals in Southern California helped to propel the San Diego sector as the busiest in the nation. At least 37,370 migrants entered the US through the San Diego sector, which includes all of Southern California except for El Centro on the Arizona state line, according to the US Border Patrol. A Chinese migrant camp near Jacumba, California has signs showing Chinese asylum seekers where to turn themselves over to US Border Patrol agents In April, the San Diego region surpassed Tucson, which had been the nation's busiest, and fell to second with 31,219 border encounters. El Paso sector, which includes the West Texas city and all of New Mexico , rose to third with 30,393. San Diego's rise as the number one border hot spot had been expected, as the area had been getting bombarded with as many as 6,000-8,000 border crossers a week in the last few months. 'Unfortunately, I'm not surprised,' San Diego County Commissioner Jim Desmond told DailyMail.com last month. ' Texas is clamping down and other areas are clamping down. Here in California, they're allowed to walk in unimpeded. They're going to follow the path of least resistance, and the least resistance is in California.' A $13 billion business of trafficking humans from Mexico into the US has been described as whac-a-mole by border experts- where one area flares up as others quiet down. Migrants who are arrested in San Diego sector are vetted by US Border Patrol are being released onto the streets. The county migrant shelter closed a few months back, after local leaders decided they did not want to the $18 million dollars a year to keep running it. However, the county has been promised $20 million by the Biden to open up a shelter in the coming weeks. 'It was costing us, at that point in time, about $1.5 million a month to basically be their travel agent. Border Patrol was their Uber, bringing them to those drop off areas, and then we were their travel agent,' Desmond quipped. Without the local shelter, migrants are either being let loose at a transit station or at the airport by the feds. Migrants have been known to spend as many as five days crashing at the airport while they wait for a flight out of town, Desmond added. Like other border communities across the country, San Diego's airport does not add extra flights simply because there's a spike in migrant crossings. Often times, there aren't available seat to fly out or migrants, with limited means, wait a day or two until ticket prices drop and they can afford to travel to their final destination.

        "description": "No, we don't train our AI on your messages, Slack defends. But some users are still mad by Martin Hodás In mid-May, Slack caused an outcry among customers over its practices. The company was accused of allegedly training its AI and machine learning models with sensitive user data such as messages and files. The reports were based on information stated in the company’s privacy policy documentation, where Slack literally states: “Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are useful tools that we use in limited ways to enhance our product mission. We do not develop LLMs or other generative models using customer data. To develop non-generative AI/ML models for features such as emoji and channel recommendations, our systems analyze Customer Data (e.g. messages, content and files) submitted to Slack as well as Other Information (including usage information) as defined in our privacy policy and in your customer agreement.“ This unfortunate wording implies that the company is indeed reading the contents of transmitted messages and attachments and using this content to train its models to improve some of the app’s features. Additionally, using customer data to train artificial intelligence is becoming an unpleasant trend in the tech world, so such a practice wouldn’t come as a huge surprise. However, in response to Neowin’s questions, Slack assured that it is not scanning message content to train AI models: “Slack has used machine learning for other intelligent features (like search result relevance, ranking, etc.) since 2017, which is powered by de-identified, aggregate user behavior data. These practices are industry standard, and those machine learning models do not access original message content in DMs, private channels, or public channels to make these suggestions.” Slack also clarified what kind of data might be used to train its “global models”: A timestamp of the last message sent in a channel can help Slack recommend channels to archive.The # of interactions between two users is incorporated into the user recommendation list when a user goes to start a new conversation.The # of words overlapping between a channel name and other channels can inform its relevance to that user.The company adds that it uses industry-standard, privacy-protective machine-learning techniques, and the data won’t leak across workspaces, specifying that it does not build or train ML models in a way that allows them to “learn, memorize, or reproduce customer data.” A separate negative reaction in customers was sparked by Slack's use of the aforementioned data on an opt-out basis. Additionally, there is no simple toggle in the settings to opt out. Instead, the customers are mandated to use a more traditional and bothersome way of writing an opt-out e-mail to feedback@slack.com. Slack didn’t respond to Neowin’s questions about the opt-out and didn’t specify why the company chose this approach or why there is no toggle for a quick opt-out. Lastly, to make things even more confusing, the company also offers Slack AI add-on, a separate product. However, this generative AI add-on is based on third-party large language models (LLMs) – not developed or trained by Slack and its customers’ data.",

However, in response to Neowin’s questions, Slack assured that it is not scanning message content to train AI models: “Slack has used machine learning for other intelligent features (like search result relevance, ranking, etc.) since 2017, which is powered by de-identified, aggregate user behavior data. These practices are industry standard, and those machine learning models do not access original message content in DMs, private channels, or public channels to make these suggestions.” Slack also clarified what kind of data might be used to train its “global models”: The company adds that it uses industry-standard, privacy-protective machine-learning techniques, and the data won’t leak across workspaces, specifying that it does not build or train ML models in a way that allows them to “learn, memorize, or reproduce customer data.” A separate negative reaction in customers was sparked by Slack's use of the aforementioned data on an opt-out basis. Additionally, there is no simple toggle in the settings to opt out. Instead, the customers are mandated to use a more traditional and bothersome way of writing an opt-out e-mail to feedback@slack.com. Slack didn’t respond to Neowin’s questions about the opt-out and didn’t specify why the company chose this approach or why there is no toggle for a quick opt-out. Lastly, to make things even more confusing, the company also offers Slack AI add-on, a separate product. However, this generative AI add-on is based on third-party large language models (LLMs) – not developed or trained by Slack and its customers’ data.",

        "content": "Most cameras have at least one exclusive attribute, and the OM System Cameras have more than most. Its ever-expanding “Live” collection contains some of its unique computational photography features. Let’s dive into five of its tools to find out what they do and how you can use them. Some new OM System users are at first daunted by the enormous range of features on the and their predecessors. Going back three generations to the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, the flagship camera was marketed as overengineered because of its enormous range of functions and customization. The current has come much further. The Live features in the camera open up a world of creative possibilities. This was shot using LiveND. I'm a fan of technology and what it can do; I come from the generation that could program the VCR and saw the first digital watches and smartphones appear. Historically, I worked in a highly technical engineering environment, so using advanced features comes relatively easily to me. Nevertheless, I also understand that a camera's functions can be intimidating for many. Cameras are easy to use once you understand how their different functions work. So, this article explains how to use some of the OM System's most useful tools. Although primarily aimed at OM System users, this may also be interesting for those who use other camera systems and are curious about these computational photography functions. Computational photography uses the camera's processor to enhance the captured images. It improves the camera's capabilities by using features unique to digital photography. Examples of computational photography include in-camera focus stacking, HDR compilations, and creating high-resolution shots using sensor shift technology. The OM System has a raft of these features. However, the \"Live\" family is most useful for me. Live Time and Live Bulb allow you to watch a long exposure gradually develop on the live view screen or viewfinder. You can also see the histogram move to the right during the shot, enabling you to judge accurately the correct exposure. This takes the guesswork out of the timing of very long exposures and makes bulb mode more accessible to photographers. Images can be saved as raw files or JPEGs. Live Time is found in bulb mode with the newest and the Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III. Select B on the mode dial and rotate the rear thumb dial one click clockwise, and you will switch from Live Bulb to Live Time. On older Olympus models, Live Time was hidden away in Manual Mode beyond the 60-second shutter speed. (Unlike most cameras that are limited to 30 seconds in manual mode, you can do 60-second exposures with OM System cameras.) Once you have selected Live Time or Live Bulb, as shown above, you can choose how often you want the Live View screen to refresh. The number of times the camera will refresh the view depends on the ISO; the higher the ISO, the fewer times it will refresh. Press the Menu button, and you will see at ISO 80, it will refresh 24 times, and you can select refresh intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds. So, for long exposure star trails, you would choose 60 seconds. Meanwhile, for aurora shots where you may only want an 8-second exposure, you would refresh every half a second. With Live Time, you begin the exposure by briefly pressing the shutter release button and stop it by pressing it again. Meanwhile, for Live Bulb, you hold down the shutter button for the entire duration of the exposure; I generally use Live Time. You can operate the camera using a remote wired or wireless trigger. You can also use a smartphone or tablet and the OM Image Share app. Then you can watch the exposure developing on that device instead. The maximum duration for Live Time and Live Bulb is 30 minutes. When shooting very long exposures, you need your camera on a stable platform, and a good-quality tripod is ideal. The general advice is to switch the In-Body Image Stabilization (IBIS) off when using a tripod. However, I leave mine on auto as it switches off when the camera is still but also counteracts any slight movement caused by the wind or vibrations underfoot. Silent mode using the electronic shutter prevents in-camera vibrations, and if you don’t have the facility to trigger the camera remotely, the self-timer works well. Even if you misjudge the exposure time and run out of screen refreshes, you can generally estimate the correct exposure time by seeing how far along to the right the histogram has moved so far. For example, if it only moved a quarter of the way from the left in eight minutes, you know it will need another eight minutes for the histogram to move halfway. Long exposures can cause noise artifacts on your image, so switching your Noise Reduction on is preferable. On the OM-1, this is in Camera Menu 1.3 ISO/Noise Reduction. I have this set to Auto. Live Comp (Live Composite) Mode continuously takes a series of images, usually of the same scene. It only adds new, brighter light appearing in subsequent frames to the first image. The huge advantage is that you can effectively shoot a scene over an enormously long period—up to six hours—and never over-expose the original frame. Thus, Live Comp can be used for light painting, star and car headlight trails, capturing images of lightning, and so on. The final image can be saved as a raw or JPEG. Live Comp is adjacent to the Live Time settings, so at the bottom of the M mode on older cameras, or two clicks clockwise of the thumb wheel in Bulb Mode with the newer models. After selecting Live Comp, press the Menu button, which takes you to the Composite Settings. You can set the exposure's shutter speed between 0.5 to 60 seconds. You then can adjust the lens aperture and ISO and, if necessary, fit an ND filter for the correct exposure. Place the camera on a tripod, and press the shutter once to prepare for composite shooting. The second press of the shutter will start the composite. Again, you can see the image form on the back screen with brighter light being added to the original scene. Like Live Time, it’s best shot using a tripod. Again, the final image can be saved as a raw or JPEG. Because the shortest shutter speed available is 0.5 seconds, in broad daylight that would lead to over-exposure, even at ISO 80 and f/22. Consequently, using this feature to photograph lightning during the day, I fit an ND1000 filter to the lens to reduce the shutter speed. The Live ND filter partially does away with the need to carry physical ND filters by providing them electronically. On the original OM-1, the ND filter goes from ND2 (one stop) and up to ND64 (six stops), and up to ND128 is available on the OM-1 Mark II. The latter model also provides a graduated neutral density filter up to ND8 (three stops). Live ND darkens down the image, thus enabling longer exposures. Live GND works similarly but affects the part of the image to which it is applied. It allows shooting a scene with a greater dynamic range because it darkens the highlighted area, usually the sky at the top of the picture. Images can be saved as raw files or JPEGs. Live ND is available on the OM-1 Mark II, the OM-1, OM-5, and some earlier OM-D cameras. Live GND is currently only available on the OM-1 Mark II. In older models with the older menu system, Live ND is in Shooting Menu 2. With the newest models, Live ND and GND are found in the Shooting Menu (camera icon) 2.1 Computational Modes. Live ND is only accessible in manual mode (M on the mode dial) or shutter priority (S on the mode dial). Meanwhile, Live GND is also available in aperture priority (A) and program (P) modes. The filters are both activated within the menu, as shown above. Live ND will allow longer shutter times. Meanwhile, the Live GND can be moved up and down using the arrow button above and below the OK button. It can also be rotated using the front and rear dials, and the axis around which can be moved with the left and right arrow buttons. Within the menu, you can also choose a soft, medium, or hard boundary between the filtered and unfiltered areas. Because the offer up to 8.5 stops of image stabilization, it’s possible to use these features without a tripod. I've handheld 5-second exposures. During bright sunlight, my screw-on ND1000 filter will only allow, at the longest, something like a one-second exposure. However, combining it with Live ND gives scope to take up to one-minute exposures even at midday.

        "content": "The real estate market in Los Angeles has certainly evolved over the last decade, particularly during the pandemic. Over the last several years, the Valley (for example, Studio City, Sherman Oaks, and Encino) might not have been considered prestigious, but now, home prices rival those in sought-after areas like Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. The trend of people moving over the mountains to the San Fernando Valley might be on the upswing; however, this 1950s California ranch home, located in Northridge, an unsung suburban community in the northwestern quadrant of the sprawling San Fernando Valley, is reminiscent of a bygone era, when a modest single-family home like this represented the achievement of the proverbial American dream. The freshly updated home on cheery-sounding Sunburst Street, up for grabs at $1.35 million , offers 1,930 square feet of living space with four bedrooms and three bathrooms. From the exterior, the quintessential midcentury California ranch-style home is particularly discreet. The well-kept front yard houses native lush landscaping, and towering mature trees provide nice shade, while organic stone embellishments adorn the sage-green board-and-batten wood siding. While the exterior’s humble, original design has been largely preserved, the interiors have been thoroughly updated for a 21st-century life while paying homage to the home’s 1950s roots. From a Los Angeles -based design team, the home features a slew of all-new elements that recall the styles of important midcentury-modern architects like Richard Neutra, William Cody, Albert Frey, and Rudolph Schindler. The architectural details are warm, textural, and inviting, but they emphasize clean-lined simplicity. And, though the home feels open, airy and spacious, every room feels intimate and separate. The home’s original oak wood floors have been refinished and re-sealed in the original light raw wood color, and the many midcentury-inspired details include a slatted mahogany room divider, vintage door handles, smooth walnut paneling, and modular built-ins. Other design features include terrazzo-style floors; custom sliding doors from the living area to the pool; handmade tile in the kitchen; new windows; and original mahogany wood panels and cabinets. The great room features the dining table and living area, the latter of which has built-in shelving, floating cabinets, and an original stone fireplace that has been retrofitted for today’s modern standards. The cozy kitchen features fluted backsplashes and wooden cabinetry alongside state-of-the-art appliances, and a built-in breakfast nook overlooks the living and dining areas. Nearby, the primary suite is awash in natural light and overlooks the idyllic backyard. There’s ample closet space and a retro-style bathroom with a freestanding soaking tub. Outside, there’s a newly refinished kidney-shaped pool, outdoor dining, and an overhang for al fresco lounging. The backyard is surrounded by a high fence for added privacy and is filled with native landscaping. The property is listed with Cameron Stephens of Stephens Real Estate in L.A.

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- An industry-first study by global ecommerce accelerator, Pattern, has shown that despite their surging popularity, Australian consumers hold negative views on the quality of the products sold on emerging marketplaces Temu and Shein. The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers' perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. \"Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn't rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,\" said Merline McGregor , General Manager of Pattern Australia. \"With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells. This is an area where Amazon leads the sector at 58%, with eBay trailing at 39%, followed by Catch (25%), Kogan (19%) and MyDeal (11%).\" Marketplaces attract shoppers as cost-of-living pressures bite As cost-of-living pressures rise, Australian consumers are increasingly turning to marketplaces to research, compare, and purchase. A large majority of Australians shopped on a marketplace in 2023, with a staggering 94% planning to buy from platforms like Amazon, Catch, and eBay over the coming year. \"With strained household budgets, marketplaces are attracting an increasing number of shoppers with their easy-to-use price comparison functionalities and sales events. With its globally recognised Prime Day event gaining popularity in Australia , Amazon has become the leading marketplace for value-for-money purchases, attracting 48% shoppers, followed by eBay at 41% and Catch at 27%,\" said McGregor. Not only are marketplaces attracting higher volumes of shoppers, but they are more likely to secure high income shoppers in 2024. Today, over 80% of $200K earning households shop on Amazon. Even newer marketplaces like Shein attract high income consumers, with 34% of those in the $160 - $199k household income bracket buying from the platform in the past 12 months. Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon's Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform's advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia , 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process - significantly more compared to any other single marketplace. Brands need to be present on platforms with biggest product ranges Just over 60% of Australian shoppers believe Amazon has the widest product range, followed by eBay at 52%. All other platforms lagged – Catch, 20%, Temu, 17%, Kogan 14%, Shein, 11% and MyDeal 8%. Offering the most product variety and options also buys marketplaces the highest web clicks, with Amazon averaging 75.2 million monthly site visits and eBay 50.9 million. \"It's no surprise there's a direct correlation between marketplaces perceived to have the best product ranges and those platforms, like Amazon, that attract the highest volumes of web traffic. Brands need to be present where their shoppers are. While the larger marketplaces may have more competition, they also have the biggest audiences of potential shoppers to target,\" concluded McGregor.

Responses were collected online, and the survey was restricted to adults who had shopped online in the previous 12 months ensuring there was a representative sample of age, gender and location achieved.

        "content": "As the 2023-24 season officially comes to an end, a new season begins for Barcelona as the club try to navigate what promises to be a very busy and consequential transfer window as sporting director Deco will go to work to build a new squad in the image of soon-to-be new manager Hansi Flick. At least one big sale is expected to happen this summer, and one of the names most linked with an exit is Brazilian winger Raphinha, who has serious interest from the Premier League and Saudi Arabia and would command a big transfer fee that could be a big boost to Barça’s finances. Raphinha is currently on his way to begin preparations for the Copa América with Brazil, and he was asked about his future by the folks at El Chiringuito . Raphinha’s answer was short and sweet, and makes his desire about what should happen this summer pretty clear: Raphinha: \"Am I staying at Barça? I have a contract.\" — @elchiringuitotv pic.twitter.com/QLT6XddXTJ — Barça Universal (@BarcaUniversal) May 27, 2024 Players usually say “I have a contract” when they don’t want to be sold and hope to fulfill their current agreement with their clubs. Raphinha has always dreamed of playing for Barça and isn’t interested in ending his journey with the club after just two years, so he’ll certainly fight to stay even if a big offer comes. It remains to be seen what Barça’s position on Raphinha’s status is, and this story will certainly not go away as we approach the start of the transfer window.",

        "content": "Los primeros ministros de y y el presidente surcoreano llamaron este lunes a la desnuclearización de , en el marco de una inusual cumbre en en la que se comprometieron a reforzar la cooperación tripartita. El presidente surcoreano y los primeros ministros , de China, y , de Japón, celebraron el lunes la primera cumbre entre los tres países en casi cinco años, en parte debido a la pandemia pero también a relaciones otrora deterioradas. Poco antes de la cita, Corea del Norte informó a la guardia costera japonesa de un inminente lanzamiento satelital, como anticipó la inteligencia surcoreana. Yoon y Kishida urgieron a Pyongyang a desistir del lanzamiento, que según el dirigente surcoreano “viola directamente las resoluciones del , y socava la paz y la estabilidad regionales y mundiales”. Yoon también solicitó una respuesta internacional “decisiva” si el líder norcoreano, , sigue adelante con su cuarto lanzamiento de este tipo. Al respecto, el primer ministro chino Li pidió a las “partes relevantes ejercer la moderación y evitar futuras complicaciones en la situación de la península coreana”, según la agencia oficial china . es el principal socio comercial de Corea del Norte. En una declaración conjunta emitida tras las conversaciones, los países utilizaron su usual lenguaje para reafirmar su compromiso con la \"desnuclearización de la península coreana\", añadiendo que la paz es una \"responsabilidad\" y un \"interés común\". Corea del Norte reaccionó afirmando que \"hablar hoy de la desnuclearización de la península coreana es una grave provocación política\" y \"violaría la posición constitucional de nuestro país como Estado poseedor de armas nucleares\". La “‘desnuclearización completa de la península coreana’ ya murió teórica, práctica y físicamente”, indicó un portavoz de la cancillería norcoreana, citado por la agencia de noticias oficial . (HANDOUT/AFP) Los mandatarios chino, japonés y surcoreano anunciaron el lunes que “mantendrán conversaciones para acelerar las negociaciones de un ALC ”. Li pidió a los otros dos gobernantes “oponerse a convertir los temas económicos y comerciales en juegos políticos o asuntos de seguridad”, así como a la “ruptura de las cadenas de suministros”, indicó la agencia . El líder surcoreano Yoon agregó que los tres países \"decidieron crear un entorno transparente y predecible para el comercio y las inversiones, y dar seguridad a las cadenas de suministros\". “El sistema de cooperación trilateral debe ser fortalecido.

        "content": "BRITAIN is set to face one of the soggiest summers on record — with at least 50 days of rain forecast in just three months. The Met Office has briefed the Government and transport chiefs to expect wet conditions over the holiday season, with damp weather 50 per cent more likely than average. It could be the soggiest summer since 1912 — when showers struck on 55 days. Last year’s washout saw rain on 40 days, but even more downpours are now expected from the start of June until the end of August. This means major events including the Trooping of the Colour , Royal Ascot , Wimbledon and the Formula 1 British Grand Prix could all be blighted by bleak weather. There needs to be 2.5mm or more of rain within 24 hours to count as a rainy day. Forecasters are blaming the wet outlook on low pressure systems. The Met Office long-range forecast said: “The chances of a wetter-than-average period are higher than a drier-than-average one. “Rainfall at this time of year has a greater risk of localised heavy downpours and thunderstorms.” Britons got a taste of the dreary weather over the Bank Holiday weekend when sunny spells were interrupted by showers for much of the UK. The rain turned heavy — with hail in places — and flooding hit Wynyard, County Durham. The RAC estimated that more than 20million leisure car journeys were made over the weekend — the most since pre-pandemic levels. But motorists faced gridlocks across the country as many Bank Holiday sunseekers cut their trips short over the poor weather. Delays also hit the ferry routes from Dover , flights from Birmingham Airport and the trains — on the busy West Coast Main Line and in and out of Portsmouth . Showers eased last night and there is set to be bright start today, but it will turn overcast. Hail and thunder could also return later in the week, but it is set to be dry by Friday.",

        "content": "Doug Ford has figured out the price of power. Too bad we’re all paying for it. To the premier, it’s small beer — a mere $225 million in subsidies for suds. That’s how much he’s admitted to paying out in taxpayer funds to the big brewers as financial compensation for allowing beer into convenience stores roughly a year ahead of schedule. The political payoff? Ford wins bragging rights, with our money, for belatedly delivering on his 2018 campaign promise to make beer available just about anywhere, anytime. It also buys him the flexibility to hold an early election — not in 2026, as scheduled under Ontario’s fixed election law, but a year sooner. At what price, precisely? By some counts, it is destined be far higher than the purported low ball figure of $225 million — as much as $1 billion, according to opposition critics. Remember “buck-a-beer,” the other cynical slogan Ford dined out on in 2018? It fizzled out fast because that unsustainable price for a can of beer defied common sense and business sense. During his winning campaign, buck-a-beer was twinned with another slogan that was similarly oversold — “beer in corner stores.” Ford knew perfectly well that The Beer Store’s owners could sue the province for defaulting on a under which they’d first agreed to relax their grip on the market by phasing in supermarket beer sales. That pioneering framework, negotiated by the previous Liberal government, broke the stranglehold of the big brewers. But it wasn’t good enough for Ford — who always boasts of bettering what came before. Mercifully, Ford’s most influential cabinet ministers managed to talk him out of breaking the beer pact, persuading him that the province faced costly litigation and possible penalties exceeding $1 billion. Yet it always rankled our teetotalling premier that he’d failed to deliver on a forgotten promise. Now, all these years later, he has contented himself with an about an antiquated issue. Belatedly, beer will become more convenient — a mere one year ahead of when it otherwise would have, and four decades after it first became a political issue. Back in the 1980s, the Liberal leader of the day, David Peterson, first promised beer in corner stores but found it inconveniently complicated to deliver on it. Now, it’s a non-issue that no one notices. They’re not even called corner stores anymore. They’re no longer on every corner, not all that convenient, and mostly owned by big chains, not Mom and Pop operators. Which is why – flatter than a stale beer washing down a nothing burger. Still, there is good reason to pay attention, for we will potentially be paying far more than Ford pretends. Beyond the stated subsidy of $225 million going to The Beer Store’s owners, another $375 million in fees now paid by them to the LCBO will be rebated. As Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie points out, a wholesale discount of 10 per cent for the big grocery chains — now enjoying record profits — could easily total more than $150 million in lost revenues. If you add in the foregone licensing fees from 8,500 new stores (charged by other jurisdictions), that’s at least $300 million more money left on the table. By Crombie’s count, it adds up to a “billion-dollar booze boondoggle” that is “lining the pockets” of the wealthy and well-connected — an echo of the campaign rhetoric Ford used against the Liberals in 2018. Buy beyond the opposition critiques, there’s also the opportunity cost of spending so much time and money so utterly opportunistically on a faded, defanged oligopoly. Quite apart from financial resources, consider the governmental bandwidth being wasted by a premier who doesn’t touch a drink deploying the best minds in the public service to bringing beer into convenience stores. Imagine if Ford spent more time and money solving real problems rather than creating new ones — dealing with overflowing surgical wait-lists, say, or a housing and homelessness crisis. The speculation is that Ford prefers to gear up for an early provincial campaign to get out ahead of a federal election later that same year likely to crown his Tory cousin, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as prime minister. The premier is understandably wary of how shabbily the federal Conservatives might treat Ontario as they slash spending. An early election could also allow Ford to dodge the results an RCMP probe into his other boondoggle (that’d be the Greenbelt imbroglio). He might also catch Crombie’s Liberals off guard while deflating the NDP’s Marit Stiles before either gains traction. But it’s a quid pro quo that’s hard to quaff — or swallow: Ford’s fantasy is that by keeping his stale promise on beer in corner stores, he is now free to break the promise of fixed election dates every four years codified in law. Ford’s billion-dollar bet may be one boondoggle too many.",

        "content": "A global race to dominate the global artificial intelligence (AI) space is on, and countries are battling to outrun one another. Canada is one of the first movers in AI research, but several other countries have surpassed it lately. Sensing its declining rankings, Canada recently a $2.4 billion AI spending package to secure the country’s homegrown AI industry. Two , including ( ), or IBM, and ( ) stock, could be the early beneficiaries. To understand how each identified AI stock may benefit, its important to take a look at how Canada is channeling its sovereign AI spending budget. How will Canada spend its $2.4 billion AI investment budget? The government of Canada may disburse its $2.4 billion AI budget as follows: Most of the direct beneficiaries from the budget may be small and medium enterprises, research centres, and startups. These beneficiaries are mostly available to early-stage venture capital and private equity investors, and many may be inaccessible to public stock market investors. That said, a few publicly traded AI stocks could benefit, and Nvidia stock is one of them. Nvidia stock: Getting more business from Canada The Government of Canada and Nvidia a strategic deal in February 2024 — weeks before the country’s AI budget announcement. The deal, which is aimed at boosting computing power, came as Nvidia’s chief executive joined Canada’s AI luminaries to explore their breakthroughs in healthcare, transportation, and other AI advances. Nvidia, a leading AI stock, acknowledges Canada as an early partner (customer) since the early days of artificial intelligence, and the latest deal, whose numbers remain private, may include a guaranteed supply of AI accelerators to the country. Canada’s $2 billion investment in AI computing capabilities and technology infrastructure will most likely involve acquiring new data centre equipment, including the latest AI computing chips, and Nvidia is the leading vendor of AI computing hardware today. To be fair, Canada’s purchases of AI equipment under the $2 billion budget may not single-handedly move the needle on Nvidia’s stock price. The wildly successful recently reported a record US$26 billion in quarterly sales. IBM stock: Picking up strategic investments One of the key pillars of Canada’s AI growth strategy is strengthening its local semiconductor supply chain. On April 26, 2024, the prime minister’s office a $59.9 million investment to support IBM Canada and the MiQro Innovation Collaborative Center (C2MI), one of the country’s microelectronics research and innovation leaders, to create more semiconductors. IBM expects up to $187 million in total investment in advancing its Canadian subsidiary’s plant’s assembly, testing, and packaging capabilities, and the Government of Canada’s investment helps create a strong domestic production of semiconductors, furthering quantum research within Canadian borders. Semiconductors remain critical in the global race to scale up and adopt artificial intelligence and quantum computing. It’s unclear whether the IBM investment is directly related to the $2 billion AI budget. However, the deal could help Canada create a more vibrant semiconductor research and development ecosystem and help retain AI talent within the country. IBM is a significant AI stock to watch as its Watson AI platform gains traction. Its new AI processors in 2022 may eventually creep into an undersupplied market dominated by Nvidia’s hot-selling AI accelerators.",

        "description": "A B.C. Supreme Court justice and about a dozen lawyers couldn't proceed with murder and murder conspiracy cases May 27.",
        "content": "Murder and a murder conspiracy cases were delayed in B.C. Supreme Court May 27 due to a shortage of sheriffs that continues in B.C. despite the attorney general’s assurances it is being dealt with. Justice Kathleen Ker came into court to hear the two cases but had to leave as there was no sheriff. Sheriffs are required in courtrooms to provide security for proceedings. They also move prisoners around courthouses and transport them to court. About a dozen lawyers, including four publicly paid Crown prosecutors, were left milling around outside the courtroom at the Vancouver Law Courts on Monday. One case involved an appearance by Pascal Jean Claude Bouthillete. He and Sandy Jack Parisian were accused in the death of 78-year-old Usha Singh. Singh, who lived alone, was found badly beaten in her house on Jan. 31, 2021. Vancouver police said two men gained entry to Singh’s Little Mountain home around 6 a.m. by posing as police officers. Singh succumbed to her injuries in hospital two days later. Parisian and Bouthillete were arrested on Feb. 3, 2021. The conspiracy to commit murder case involves multiple accused. Two men are facing the court together while a third is facing the charges separately. Due to a series of publication bans in the case and the separate trials, Glacier Media has chosen not to publish details at this time. Court delays in B.C.’s justice system due to sheriff shortages have become more common in recent years. Thirty-one courtrooms were closed in Abbotsford, North Vancouver, Port Coquitlam and Surrey between Aug. 14 and Sept. 13, 2023. Earlier in 2023, sources told Glacier Media courtroom closures included those in Vancouver, Abbotsford, Port Coquitlam, Surrey, Victoria, Chilliwack and Kamloops. Concerns have already been expressed before judges and by judges that delays could begin to hamper people's right to a trial within a reasonable time period. This comes before the courts as lawyers begin mentioning the application of the so-called Jordan principles whereby that right is upheld. The Jordan principles stem from a case that wound up in the Supreme Court of Canada. Stays of proceedings are possible if a case hits a ceiling of 18 months for those tried in the provincial court and 30 months for cases in superior courts. On the May 27 Vancouver Provincial Court list alone, there were 32 cases listed in excess of 300 days (or nearly 10 months). “Delay attributable to or waived by the defence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling,” the high court said. Attorney General Nikki Sharma has acknowledged the problems created by the shortage and stressed the provincial government is working on recruiting new sheriffs. In February, Sharma announced the addition of 13 new deputies . \"Everyone who uses the court system expects it to run safely and smoothly,\" Sharma said in a statement at the time. \"Sheriffs provide critical protective and enforcement services for the judiciary, Crown, defence, court staff and the public. That's why it's so encouraging that more people than ever are applying to join the BC Sheriff Service.\" The new deputies will fill positions in Oliver, Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria and the Lower Mainland, Sharma said. Getting those recruits to courtrooms, however, does take time as they need to undergo training at the Justice Institute of BC. Glacier Media has reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on the May 27 proceedings.",

        "description": "Officers cleared in January death",
        "content": "Langley RCMP officers would have acted illegally if they took a man into custody for threatening suicide because he convincingly claimed otherwise, B.C.’s Independent Investigations Office (IIO) has ruled. The man, identified only as AP, killed himself a few days after police visited in January. A Monday, May 27 decision released by the police watchdog shows officers visited AP twice after he texted his mother to say “I am done and I can’t do this anymore” and she contacted RCMP to advise her son had attempted suicide in the past. During the first visit by an RCMP officer on Jan. 10, AP insisted he was “merely expressing frustration at academic studies in which he was engaged, as well as other difficulties in his life,” the IIO review summarized. A previous IIO statement said AP was living in the 20200 block of 66th Ave. at the time. AP said he was taking his medications properly, showed the officer the meds “laid out in an orderly manner” and agreed to call for help if he required it. Less than an hour later, a social worker reported receiving emails from the man threatening suicide. When two Langley officers returned to his home later that day, AP insisted the email was referring to actions to be taken in the future, in the event of his death, “not a plan to die shortly.” He had been drinking, and one of the officers convinced him to pour out the remaining alcohol to avoid further escalation, the report said. According to the RCMP members, AP was “evidently intelligent and insightful, was able to respond to all their concerns, and all their questions in a plausible and reassuring manner.” On Jan. 11, an officer spoke with the AP’s mother, who later told the IIO she did not have any concern that he was in immediate danger of self-harm at that time. Another family member, who spoke with AP that same day, said there was “no suggestion that he was in imminent danger.” But when the mother was unable to contact her son, police returned to the home on Jan., 14 and found AP dead from apparent suicide. IIO Interim Chief Civilian Director Sandra J. Hentzen ruled the officers “did everything they reasonably could to test him for present suicidal intention and he passed the tests. It appears that not only was [he] able to conceal his true intent from the police, but he was also able to deceive close family members in the time between the officers’ visits and his eventual death.” Officers did not have sufficient grounds to apprehend AP under the Mental Health Act based on their personal observations,” Hentzen said. “It would in fact have been unlawful for them to proceed with an apprehension and it was appropriate for them not to do so.” Accordingly “the matter will not be referred to Crown counsel for consideration of charges,” Hentzen ruled.",

The Met Office has briefed the Government and transport chiefs to expect wet conditions over the holiday season, with damp weather 50 per cent more likely than average. 3 People carry their shopping through heavy flooding in County Durham Credit: Jordan Crosby 3 People huddle under umbrellas as they go punting on the River Cam in Cambridge Credit: Geoff Robinson Photography 3 A car is partly submerged after heavy rain Credit: Jordan Crosby It could be the soggiest summer since 1912 — when showers struck on 55 days. Last year’s washout saw rain on 40 days, but even more downpours are now expected from the start of June until the end of August. This means major events including the Trooping of the Colour , Royal Ascot, Wimbledon and the Formula 1 British Grand Prix could all be blighted by bleak weather. There needs to be 2.5mm or more of rain within 24 hours to count as a rainy day. Forecasters are blaming the wet outlook on low pressure systems. The Met Office long-range forecast said: “The chances of a wetter-than-average period are higher than a drier-than-average one. “Rainfall at this time of year has a greater risk of localised heavy downpours and thunderstorms.” Britons got a taste of the dreary weather over the Bank Holiday weekend when sunny spells were interrupted by showers for much of the UK.

        "description": "Contributions to NSSF shot up by Sh26.5 billion in 2023 as detailed in the latest report despite a drop in the number of newly registered employees and employers over the period.",
        "content": "Contributions to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) shot up by Sh26.5 billion in 2023 as detailed in the latest report despite a drop in the number of newly registered employees and employers over the period. Enhanced contributions to the fund as per the NSSF Act 2013 that took effect early last year may have played a key role in this increase even as data also raises questions on the drop of the number of employees and employers registered with NSSF. Data from the latest Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey shows contributions made to the state-affiliated retirement fund in 2023 stood at Sh43.4 billion compared to Sh16.9 billion in 2022. This is as newly registered employers, employees and voluntary contributors dropped over the period. “Newly registered male and female employees decreased by 1.8 per cent and 29.7 per cent respectively from 2022 to 2023,” the report says. “Contributions paid increased from sh16.9 billion to sh43.4 billion in 2023.” The increase reported in the Economic Survey 2024 coincides with also the enactment of the 2013 NSSF Act that enhanced contribution to the fund that was implemented in February 2023. As such, while the number of employers, employees and voluntary contributors might have dropped, the enhanced contribution replenished the fund by more than double. Previously, employees used to contribute sh200 a month notwithstanding the amounts one makes as gross salary. In the new Act, the contributions are gradual and have been split into two tiers – I and II – which should have individuals contributing up to six per cent of their income. While Tier I contributions are made directly to NSSF, employers can opt out for Tier II if they get approval of the Retirements Benefits Authority to contribute instead to a regulated retirement scheme of choice. Effectively, the amounts paid to the fund when the Act came into effect in 2013 rose from Sh200 to Sh1,080 for both employees and employer. This amount will progressively be increased over a period of five years. NSSF in February released the rates for 2024, which show the contributions went up to Sh2,160 for employees, which is matched by employers. “This is therefore to notify all employers effective February 2024 payroll, of the NSSF contribution rates for the second year. Remittances to the Fund should be made by the 9th of each subsequent month,” read the notice by NSSF. The drop in the number of newly registered members could signify increased operational costs by businesses which, apart from enhanced NSSF deductions, are also expected to contribute to the Affordable Housing Levy to match the employees’ contributions, which increased overhead expenses. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter “The number of newly registered employees in NSSF declined by 14.5 per cent to 395, 561 in 2023 from 462,519 in 2022,” said the Economic Survey 2024. Employment rate But as the number of employees and employers registered with the NSSF dropped in 2023, the same report shows an increase of 4.4 per cent in employment rate over the period. Some 848,100 jobs were created in 2023 compared to 816,000 in 2022, majority of the them in the accommodation and food service activities, which ideally should inform either more employers or employees as well registering with the fund. However, a drop in this number could mean probably majority of the jobs are in the informal sector, which the report confirms, or some employers may not be willingly registering their businesses with the NSSF due to the increased cost of operations occasioned by high taxes and the hawk eye of the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) through the electronic Tax Invoice Management System (eTIMS). This is particularly key owing to the fact that the report records an increase in the number of wage employment (formal) that grew by more than 100,000 to 3.1 million in 2023. The drop in NSSF voluntary members from 175,566 in 2022 to 171,241 in 2023 also speaks of dwindling disposal income due to the increased cost of living partly contributed by taxes. The number of voluntary members to NSSF was 137,686 in 2021 which grew from 112,580 in 2020 when the country was battling the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of newly registered employers was 24,768 in 2023, a drop from 36,991 in 2022. While not being the largest wage employer, jobs in the accommodation and food services sector increased by 27.8 per cent in 2023 due to the the tourism sector surpassing pre-Covid 19 levels as it employed 97,000 compared to 75,900 in 2022. Manufacturing, which is the country’s largest employer, grew its wage employment to 340,600 in 2023 from 329,600 in 2022 while agriculture, which grew seven per cent in 2023 after a negative performance in 2022, combined with fishing and forestry employed 302,400 individuals in 2023 compared to 299,700 in 2022. Jobs in the informal sector, where majority of the voluntary NSSF members fall, rose by 720,900 in 2023 to stand at 16.7 million. “Total employment exclusion small scale agriculture and pastoralist activities stood at 20 million in 2023 up from 19.1 million persons recorded in 2022,” said the Economic Survey 2024.",

        "description": "The Finance Act 2023 remains one of the most controversial money laws, with some of the clauses still being contested in court.",
        "content": "Close to a year after the Finance Act 2023 came into effect, many Kenyans are still struggling to adjust to the realities that the law dealt them. This is even as the National Treasury proposes even more new tax measures that analysts have warned could have a similar kind of impact on Kenyans, making essentials such as bread and transportation more expensive. The Finance Act 2023 remains one of the most controversial money laws, with some of the clauses still being contested in court. A look at the Economic Survey 2024, which shows how the economy performed last year, somewhat gives a view of the kind of impact that the Finance Act 2023 had on Kenyans. Different sectors reduced their consumption of petroleum products by reacting to the high cost of fuel, which could have meant a reduction in activities while construction also suffered a to the higher cost of building materials. Different sector players noted that last year’s Finance Act made life difficult for Kenyans and argued that the Treasury should have been considerate this year. “With mwananchi still recovering from the adverse impact of the fiscal changes imposed in 2023, we strongly believe that the focus as a country must be on supporting the manufacturing industry to reduce the cost of locally produced products and services, to drive job and wealth creation, boost productivity, as a result, it will lower the cost of living for mwananchi and create prosperity for Kenya,” said Kenya Association of Manufacturers chief executive Anthony Mwangi. Alex Kanyi, a partner at financial consultancy firm Cliffe Dekker and Hofmeyr, said the Treasury should have measured the impact of the previous measures before introducing new ones. He added that the government should make data-driven proposals, ensuring changes are effective before implementing further reforms. “We are getting into another difficult cycle. The tax measures that were introduced last year already stretched many Kenyans. We are however seeing more taxes being introduced through the finance bill 2024,” he said. “For Kenyans, it means you must tighten your belts, since you will be left with less disposable income. The government should have gone through the old taxes introduced last year instead of coming up with entirely new proposals and see what did not work out instead of introducing new ones.” It suffices to say that in 2023, EIPL was imposed on industrial raw materials such as kraft paper, steel billets, and cement clinkers to support local manufacturing. “While KAM is in full support of local manufacturing, imposing EIPL on raw materials without data verification does more harm than good,” said KAM in a recent statement after a review of the Finance Bill 2024. “KAM has analysed, in detail, the impact of EIPL on the paper, steel and cement sectors and has noted unparalleled negative unintended consequences in those sectors that are crucial to the economy. “The cost of construction has since gone up by at least 40 per cent due to this unwarranted policy action.” affected by the levy include construction which grew at a slower rate of three percent in 2023 compared to a growth of 4.1 per cent in 2022. The decelerated growth was evidenced by declines in key inputs in the construction industry such as cement consumption and volume of imported iron and steel, cement clinkers and non-ferrous metals. Imported clinker, critical in the manufacture of cement, dropped by 77.5 per cent. Treasury has sought to expand the number of products that pay EIPL in the Finance Bill 2024 to include raw materials for manufacturing of paper packaging materials, critical for packaging food products and household items.",

        "description": "Counties will in the Financial year 2024/2025 be smiling all the way to the bank after parliament reached a deal to allocate them the highest amount of shareable revenue.",
        "content": "Counties will in the Financial year 2024/2025 be smiling all the way to the bank after parliament reached a deal to allocate them the highest amount of shareable revenue since the advent of devolution. The Senate and National Assembly on Monday reached an agreement on the division of revenue share where Counties will now be allocated Sh400.1 billion of shareable revenue in the financial year 2024/2025. This amount is Sh15 billion higher than the amount allocated in the current financial year where counties were allocated Sh385 billion. This figure was arrived at following deliberation by members of a joint mediation team of the two houses after the Senate had been pushing for Sh415 billion for counties while the National Assembly wanted counties allocated Sh391 billion. Members of the joint committee who met at Parliament buildings yesterday had at some point to take a break to consult following a heated exchange. Both Senators and MP seemed each to stick to their initial positions and after lengthy deliberations, the Senate agreed to climb down as the National Assembly adjusted its position upwards. National Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Ndindi Nyoro who co-chaired the talks said the deal was a win for devolution since it was the first time that the two houses reached an agreement on the contentious issue. He asked governors to make good use of the funds allocated to their counties. “The Senate has agreed to reduce their figure by Sh15 billion while the National Assembly has agreed to push up its earlier figure by Sh9 billion in the spirit of give and take so that we can resolve this matter and allow Counties to get their increased allocation from Sh385 billion in the last financial year,” said Nyoro. The Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi who co-chaired the talks with Nyoro said they were proud that counties had gotten a Sh15 billion increase compared to the last financial year when they got Sh385 billion while the Senate had wanted them to get Sh30 billion extra by getting Sh415 billion. Murungi said that the two teams had held lengthy deliberations and they were all in agreement that devolution was working and that it should be supported by ensuring that counties get sufficient funds to carry out the devolved functions calling for the respective administrations to ensure prudent expenditure. The Division of Revenue Allocation Bill was published and introduced in the National Assembly on March 12 this year after which it was considered and approved without amendments on March 20 with a proposal of Sh391 billion for counties with the bill referred to the Senate for concurrence which amended with a proposal of Sh415 billion for the shareable revenue. Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula appointed nine members each to join the parliamentary mediation with 18 members so as to resolve the crisis caused by the National Assembly rejecting amendments made by the Senate over the bill. Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were elected as the co- chairmen for the mediation committee during the first meeting held in Parliament building and they are expected to steer the team to come up with a decision to be adopted by the two houses. Wetangula appointed Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Teso South MP Mary Emase, Ugenya MP David Ochieng, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto,Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi,Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, and Garsen MP Ali Wario to be members of this team. Kingi appointed Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Machakos Senator Kavindu Muthama, Marsabit Senator Mohammed Chute and Migori Senator Eddy Oketch to be members of the committee. The majority of Members of the National Assembly had argued when the bill was brought to the house two weeks ago from the Senate that the increase in funds to counties meant a reduction to allocation to the National Government Constituency Development Fund(NGCDF) and National Government Affirmative Action Fund(NGAAF). Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter The majority of Senators who responded to the rejection of their proposed amendments by their colleagues in the National Assembly of the house said that it was imprudent for them to seek an allocation to the 47 counties capped at Sh391 billion and go ahead to castigate the Senate which was only championing for the development of the country through devolution. During the first meeting of the joint committee held last Thursday, Nyoro said that contrary to perception out there the National Assembly fully supported devolution and that the reason they had stuck with Sh391 billion as shareable revenue to counties was due to financial constraints the country was currently facing. “The National Assembly Budget Committee that I chair met with the Council of Governors and found out that there are funding gaps and that they had to look for an extra Sh4 billion as a conditional grant for health to counties, that is why we are willing to move the shareable revenue to counties to Sh395 billion to address this shortfall,” said Nyoro. The Kiharu MP said that they should deliberate and resolve the impasse as soon as possible and that it was worth noting that Sh391 billion was proposed by Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council which was affirmed by the National Assembly with the Senate proposing Sh415 billion while the Commission for Revenue Allocation had proposed Sh396 billion to be released to the counties. Nyoro said the country was working with a budget of about Sh4.1 trillion with Sh270 billion slashed off and now they are dealing with Sh3.8 trillion and that they had set a ceiling of Sh391 billion for counties with the proposal of Sh415 billion by the Senate being untenable. Nyoro said by the Senate dealing with a figure of Sh415 billion will create a deficit of Sh24 billion and that there is need to cap a deficit at the GDP ratio of 2.9 percent and that they are not dealing with an open envelope which has led to the cost of borrowing coming down gradually. He said some of the considerations are that they should cede the Roads Maintenance Levy Fund to the counties and that if they agree with the Senate they will have Sh10 billion slashed from the Nation Government Constituency Development Fund to go to this fund. Murungi said that the decision by the Senate to push to have Sh415 billion allocated to the counties was meant to ensure that they are able to run their operations and that counties cannot be starved of funds because one governor or the other is misusing public funds terming it as blanket condemnation. “Members of the National Assembly did not use kind words when dismissing the Senate proposal for the increase of allocation of funds to counties to Sh415 billion, they should have instead expressed their reservation in a civilized manner since I believe it is the wish of every Kenyan having devolution working,” said Murungi. Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi said that devolution plays a crucial role but the country is operating under strained financial times and that as much they support counties they have to live with the fact that there is no enough money that is why the National Assembly supported Sh391 billion. Nyakundi said that instead of increasing money allocated to the counties Senators should get more money for oversight so that they can ensure that there is value for money going to the county governments since there are a lot of corruption-related cases witnessed across the 47 counties. Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago said that having served as Governor he can attest that devolution is working with issues at grassroot level addressed well addressed compared to when the central government was responsible for all functions and that they wanted all devolved functions to be under counties “We are not looking at additional resources but making good use of what is available with a view to redirecting functions that are in national government and ought to be devolved with most government agencies performing devolved function gobbling up billions of shillings that could have been used well under counties,” said Mandago. The Uasin Gishu Senator said that Agriculture and Health Ministries budgets have been increasing in the last 10 years while the functions are 95 per cent devolved and that they need to look at functions that are being duplicated at the national level.",

        "description": "The bench said the amount awarded by the High Court was reasonable as it would enable the distributor to recoup its expenditure and goodwill.",
        "content": "Beer maker Heineken will pay Kenyan distributor Maxam Limited Sh1.7 billion for breach of rights to distribute its products in the country. This is after the Court of Appeal affirmed a High Court’s order for Heineken to pay Maxam for illegally terminating a contract to distribute its products in Kenya. Justices Pauline Nyamweya, Abida Ali-Aroni and John Mativo dismissed Heineken’s appeal and ordered the firm to shoulder the cost of the case. The bench was of the view that the t was reasonable as it would enable the distributor recoup its expenditure and goodwill. “Once goodwill legally vested, it could not be unilaterally annulled. In our view, given the loss and damage arising from the circumstances of the breach by Heineken EA and Heineken BV, the projection of profits by PW2 for the period 2017 to 2021 was reasonable and adequate to enable Maxam Ltd to recoup its expenditure and goodwill,” the bench, headed by Justice Nyamweya, ruled. On May 21, 2013, Heineken East Africa Import Company Limited (Heineken EA) wrote to Maxam appointing it the only distributor of its products. Two months earlier, on February 28, 2013, Heineken International BV, on behalf of Heineken EA, appointed Modern Lane Limited, which is Maxam’s subsidiary, to distribute Heineken Lager in Uganda from February 1 of the same year. This was to await the preparation of a formal distribution contract. Heineken Brouwerijen BV wrote a letter to Olepasu Tanzania Ltd, confirming that it would be the importer in Tanzania from April 2013. Nearly four years into the respective contracts, on January 27, 2016, terminating its deal from May 1, 2016. This, according to Heineken BV, was also supposed to affect Modern Lane and Olepasu. The three companies challenged the move before the High Court. Maxam was the key party in the case. Before the High Court, Maxam’s lawyer Phillip Nyachoti argued that the termination was unprocedural and illegal. He argued that Heineken tried to shield itself from litigation by indicating that the termination was without prejudice. He was of the view that Heineken BV could not terminate Maxam’s contract as it was not in the picture. Instead, the lawyer argued that Heineken EA had committed that it would issue Maxam with a three-month termination notice in the event it wanted to end the relationship. The lawyer also said that Heineken EA and Heineken BV never explained to his clients why they had decided to terminate the agreement. Nyachoti further argued that by time Heineken BV was terminating Maxam’s contract, the Kenyan firm’s value was Sh1.7 billion and it stood to lose the value of its business if the termination was allowed without compensation. At the High Court, Heineken ordered not to terminate Maxam’s distribution rights. The orders were issued by Justice Eric Ogola. The two, however, defied the court order and appointed one of the Maxam’s sub-distributors as the exclusive distributor. Justice Joseph Onguto extended the orders barring Heineken from terminating the contract. Maxam told the court that Heineken went to the extent of directly selling to the market in a bid to circumvent the orders. On the flip side, Nyachoti argued that Heineken EA and Heineken BV went ahead to increase Maxam’s buying price of Heineken products while reducing the recommended selling price. After hearing rival submissions, High Court judge James Makau found that Heineken EA and Heineken BV had constructively kicked out the local distributor in 2016 and proceeded to appoint other distributors.",

        "description": "Officers cleared in January death",
        "content": "Langley RCMP officers would have acted illegally if they took a man into custody for threatening suicide because he convincingly claimed otherwise, B.C.’s Independent Investigations Office (IIO) has ruled. The man, identified only as AP, killed himself a few days after police visited in January. A Monday, May 27 decision released by the police watchdog shows officers visited AP twice after he texted his mother to say “I am done and I can’t do this anymore” and she contacted RCMP to advise her son had attempted suicide in the past. During the first visit by an RCMP officer on Jan. 10, AP insisted he was “merely expressing frustration at academic studies in which he was engaged, as well as other difficulties in his life,” the IIO review summarized. A previous IIO statement said AP was living in the 20200 block of 66th Ave. at the time. AP said he was taking his medications properly, showed the officer the meds “laid out in an orderly manner” and agreed to call for help if he required it. Less than an hour later, a social worker reported receiving emails from the man threatening suicide. When two Langley officers returned to his home later that day, AP insisted the email was referring to actions to be taken in the future, in the event of his death, “not a plan to die shortly.” He had been drinking, and one of the officers convinced him to pour out the remaining alcohol to avoid further escalation, the report said. According to the RCMP members, AP was “evidently intelligent and insightful, was able to respond to all their concerns, and all their questions in a plausible and reassuring manner.” On Jan. 11, an officer spoke with the AP’s mother, who later told the IIO she did not have any concern that he was in immediate danger of self-harm at that time. Another family member, who spoke with AP that same day, said there was “no suggestion that he was in imminent danger.” But when the mother was unable to contact her son, police returned to the home on Jan., 14 and found AP dead from apparent suicide. IIO Interim Chief Civilian Director Sandra J. Hentzen ruled the officers “did everything they reasonably could to test him for present suicidal intention and he passed the tests. It appears that not only was [he] able to conceal his true intent from the police, but he was also able to deceive close family members in the time between the officers’ visits and his eventual death.” Officers did not have sufficient grounds to apprehend AP under the Mental Health Act based on their personal observations,” Hentzen said. “It would in fact have been unlawful for them to proceed with an apprehension and it was appropriate for them not to do so.” Accordingly “the matter will not be referred to Crown counsel for consideration of charges,” Hentzen ruled.",

        "description": "Infrastructure projects are poised to play a key role in the success of the AfCFTA with policymakers insisting on the need to derisk these investments to attract the private sector.",
        "content": "Infrastructure projects are poised to play a key role in the success of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) with policymakers insisting on the need to derisk these investments to attract the private sector. At the ongoing African Development Bank (AfDB) annual meeting in Nairobi, the continent’s dependency on developed nations to fund these projects was discouraged. It was also noted that the slow Africa has hurt industrialisation - leaving the continent trading in raw materials instead of finished goods as envisioned in trade agreements. South Africa High Commissioner to Kenya Johanness Mahlangu said this dependency had African nations caught unaware in recent times due to macro conditions, among them the financial market meltdown and the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Mahlangu said the reliance on traditional Western partners should be countered with South-to-South corporations and intra-Africa trade. He cited infrastructure and connectivity deficit and trade agreements with developed markets as some of the challenges that face the implementation of the AfCFTA. The Rainbow Nation’s envoy said trade agreements with developed countries should be complementary to AfCFTA. “Our industries have remained small scale and infrastructure development has been on a snail space. These are some of the factors that have affected the development of Africa hence we are still dependent on trading of basic commodities,” he said. Mr Mahlangu was speaking during a breakout session on building resilient African economies in the face of economic shocks. The discussion was in line with the theme for the AfDB meeting - Africa’s Transformation, African Development Bank Group, and Reform of the Global Financial Architecture. He said Covid-19 exposed the continent’s overdependency on Western markets, noting that AfCFTA as well as BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have enormous opportunities to reverse this trend. “We have witnessed the expansion of BRICS to BRICS+ and more developing countries are expected to join. The expansion of these groupings with the context of opportunities,” he said. He added: “We have to change and focus on something that will not catch us unaware when such pandemics come.” BRICS+ is an intergovernmental organisation comprising of formerly comprising of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa before Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates also joined. The last four countries were admitted this year. East African Business Council (EABC) Executive Director John Bosco Kalisa said infrastructure is one of the reasons behind East Africa’s 5.4 per cent growth. He noted the growing challenge in the region, funded by the governments and the development partners, crowding out the private sector. “The role of the private sector has been very marginal. It accounts for only three per cent,” he said. He called for the derisking of our infrastructure investment. “We need to create an enabling environment for the private sector to invest in infrastructure development both roads, ports, and digital,” he said, citing Kenya as a leading market for digital infrastructure on the continent. Mr Kalisa urged the continent to embrace multimodal transport to reduce trading costs. “How do we ensure our ports are active where ship turnaround is four days yet in other places it is 24 hours,” he said.",

        "description": "Former Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri pointed an accusing finger at Roads CS Kipchumba Murkomen, and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi as Rift Valley leaders spearheading a smear campaign against the DP.",
        "content": "The emerging rift between President William Ruto and his Deputy Rigathi Gachagua has grown more evident after political leaders who have been dragged into the scheme continue to reveal themselves by engaging in more attacks against Gachagua. Former Bahati MP Kimani Ngunjiri earlier pointed an accusing finger at Roads Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi as the Rift Valley leaders spearheading a well-oiled smear campaign against Gachagua. “They are in the forefront in the incitement campaign and the fight against the Deputy President. They have sufficient funds to carry out their plan, they are the ones leading the meetings together with the youthful leaders from Mt Kenya region,” Ngunjiri has claimed. From the Mt Kenya region’s side, another Gachagua’s ally Embakasi North MP James Gakuya, has pointed an accusing finger to MPs Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) Mwangi Kiunjuri (Laikipia East) and former State House New Media Director Dennis Itumbi as those who are being used to soil the image of the Deputy President in his own backyard. The scheme aims at making Gachagua look like a leader lacking national appeal, Gakuya told The Standard Gakuya claimed that the leaders are pushing a narrative that Nyoro was the most suitable leader to replace Gachagua as Ruto’s running mate for the 2027 re-election game plan. The leaders have now gone ballistic accusing Gachagua of using a retrogressive card; that of asking the elected leaders to remain in their electoral zones even as they denied claims of political tourism saying they were on a political development tour. On Monday, Kiunjuri denied the tag of collaborating with people soiling Gachagua’s image. He claimed it was Gachagua who had such qualities. The Laikipia East MP accused Gachagua of being an activist. He said a deputy president should not be seen campaigning about the one-man-one vote-one-shilling revenue sharing formula but his power to push for the formula be implemented. “The motion can be brought through cabinet which is usually done through the leader of the majority. Those people who are yapping on the streets are members of that cabinet. They have the power to even collect signatures for a constitutional review. What exactly are they telling us? They are playing political activism.’’ Kiunjuri told The Standard. While accusing Gachagua of forcing himself on the people to be recognised as a kingpin and issuing threats to leaders to commandeer them, Kiunjuri claimed Gachagua, despite being the senior most political leader from Mt Kenya region, he had no clout to be the region’s kingpin. “Why do you want to force yourself on the people? Where have you ever heard of a leader forcing himself on others. Leadership is cultivated to a point where you gain acceptability by people; it is not earned by inflicting fear on them,” Kiunjuri said. While comparing the second in command with a qualified clergy with no experience, Kiunjuri said “If you pursue theology to become a reverend and you are conferred a degree and you even further your studies to be called a professor but you have never been in active preaching you can’t argue with the church elder who has been in church for over 70 years. You can’t go about disrespecting such people”. On his part, Itumbi took to his social media platform to respond to Gakuya saying: “Our call for generational change is not about disregarding the past but learning and benefitting from mentorship. ‘‘Generational change is just a voice of the majority. We appreciate those before us for their guidance and achievements, but we have come of age and we are ready to take our positions in business, careers and politics”. He continued “We are your sons and daughters; we decline the invite to have a tribal conversation. Like many of my generation, the language I speak has never given me an advantage, so I therefore decline an invitation to discuss Gikùyù supremacy”. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi on Sunday told Gachagua off saying he could not control where he goes or how he handles his political affairs. “You cannot control where I go. If we all stayed in our respective constituencies then we could not be in government. We had to fly all over the country to ask Kenyans to elect this government. I am not someone you can threaten. I have been threatened enough and this does not move me,” the MP claimed he would not cease holding fundraisers anywhere in the country, a thing he said he inherited from the President. CS Murkomen told congregants of Kaplomboi Catholic church Sotik constituency in Bomet that he had no time and luxury to do politics of hatred. His only duty was to help the President deliver on his mandate “through my docket”. “There are people who have problems with us when we tour the country and fellowship with Kenyans over the weekend, yet it is an opportunity for us in the Executive to come face to face with realities on the ground,” the CS said on Sunday. Other leaders who attended the event included the host MP Francis Sigei, Bomet Senator H ilary Sigei and MPs Japheth Nyakundi (Kitutu Chache). Reuben Kiborek (Mogotio) among others who accused Gachagua of propagating politics of deceit, tribalism, nepotism and division. Politics of gagging leaders and confining them into their electoral zones is retrogressive and has no place in today’s politics,” Sotik MP said. Mogotio MP Reuben Kiborek said “It is retrogressive for a leader to tell leaders not to go to other areas other than where they are elected telling people to stay in his corner but I also need visitors to come in my area and help me in my developmental agenda”. However, Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei said although Gachagua and Ruto enjoyed a cordial working relationship ‘there were a few individuals who wanted to bring a wedge between them.’ “As leadership, we shall not allow political conmanship to derail our government. ‘‘The Presidency deserves absolute respect. If you disrespect DP Gachagua you are also disrespecting President Ruto,” he told The Standard on the phone. Despite Ruto’s allies stinging remarks against Gachagua, the President’s silence over the matter has added more confusion into the matter as it is not known whether his lieutenants have his blessings.",

        "description": "Many governments on the continent have entered into carbon offset contracts with different firms, which observers say could be rushed moves.",
        "content": "Kenya and many African countries could be shortchanging themselves in rushing to sign carbon deals. Many governments on the continent have entered into carbon offset contracts with different firms, which observers say could be rushed moves. They warn that the firms taking large tracts of land today to reclaim and generate carbon credits could be making billions in the coming years with the host communities and governments making peanuts when the real value is unlocked. A new report by the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) shows that while Africa produces more credits than the global average from categories that command high prices, “anecdotal evidence indicates that, for the same project type, African carbon credits may command lower prices than the global average”. The report notes that currently African carbon markets comprise only about 16 per cent of the global credits market and face challenges that can hinder future growth potential. Locking in prices Among the challenges include determining the value of the carbon credits today and in the future going by how the market will likely move in the coming years. ACMI chief executive Paul Muthaura said there are concerns about the level of understanding of the contracts that governments and communities are signing. “If, for instance, you are signing a 50-year lease on land, how have you factored in the likely change in value and change for those carbon credits over that time? Are you locking in poor prices right now for that long term?” he posed during a roundtable in Nairobi yesterday. “And how do you make sure that people are aware and empowered to make sure effective deals are being negotiated?”. He said capacity building is critical to ensure that local communities and even governments are able to reach the best possible decisions when getting into agreements. “There is a need for capacity building and education so that governments and communities have an understanding of the specifics of a contract and the opportunities when negotiating. This will enable them to make well informed free, prior and informed consent to what is being put in place,” Mr Muthaura said. “We should have clarity on what our national goals are and how this negotiation fits into a country’s goals. We should negotiate within this context and understanding and not on a deal. A deal will always work against our best interests.” ACMI and the African Union Commission are currently working to have a continental framework in place that should then guide countries when negotiating the deals. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter “We are already in discussions with AUC to work towards some level of coordination of legal frameworks on the continent. We can then start talking about African credits rather than project credits. “As long as you are discussing project to project , you will always be squeezed. We should be discussing at a jurisdictional level but ideally at a regional level,” said Muthaura. The value of carbon sinks is something that Shiftings Ltd, owned by Cyrus Jirongo, is trying to unlock, working with different African governments. The firm has partnered with China’s Luokung Technology in working with to determine the value of these assets, which would help countries make more informed choices when getting into carbon deals with both private sector firms and other government agencies. Mr Jirongo said the problem with most of the African countries was them getting into carbon trading without knowing their worth thus getting prone to poor negotiations. The former Kenyan cabinet minister has made inroads in the region, with his firm mapping out the carbon assets that different countries in an effort to ensure that African countries are getting into carbon agreements from a point of knowledge. Shiftings Ltd uses technology to quantify carbon assets over a geographical location while hand-holding them to set up platforms such as carbon exchanges and carbon accounting standards. The company in February this year signed an agreement with Uganda that was witnessed by President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. Shiftings, together with Luokong Technologies, will deploy a cutting-edge Digital Measuring, Reporting, and Verification (DMRV) platform that will be used to arrive at the value of carbon credits that different carbon assets can generate. This will cover Uganda’s Lakes, Forests and Parks that are under the Ministry of Environment. The firm will also help Uganda set up a carbon exchange in Kampala. “What we have are advanced tools that ensure standardised, digitally-driven carbon accounting for nature-based projects at a fraction of traditional costs and time,” said Jirongo. “In Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a number of the countries we are in talks with, we will help them know their potential so that they can trade from a point of knowledge.” Jirongo said that through the use of state-of-the-art satellite imagery, remote sensing, and machine learning technologies, his firm would provide Carbon Neutrality Data Services and Natural Resources Asset Management to assess and monitor a country’s carbon reserves. NasDaq traded, a Chinese firm, Luokung Technology Corp is a leading provider of, full services in the entire life cycle of the carbon economy, remote sensing data processing and application services, and spatial-temporal intelligent big data services. Prominent deals African countries have been getting into carbon deals with different firms, many of them foreign-owned. Among the prominent deals include those signed with Blue Carbon Initiative, owned by Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook al-Maktoum of Dubai’s ruling royal family. Among the deals that Blue Carbon has signed include a Framework of Collaboration (FOC) with Kenya’s Ministry of Environment signed last November. In the agreement, Kenya will cede millions of hectares to Blue Carbon which is then expected to restore and protect the area, with the goal of earning carbon credits. The credits will then be sold to major polluters. The Dubai-based firm has signed similar carbon offsetting deals with other African countries, covering large tracts of land. Some of these have attracted criticism, which include a deal with Zimbabwe covering as much as 20 percent of its and mass, 10 percent of Liberia and Zambia and eight percent of Tanzania. The large chunks of land position the Sheikh to become one of the biggest players in the emerging African carbon markets. Analysts noted that this could one day be worth billions. His private office has a portfolio of privately held group companies that focus mainly on infrastructure development, energy projects, LNG terminal development, and commodity and oil trading, among others. Blue Carbon itself is relatively young, founded about one year ago and still getting its footing in the management of carbon offset projects. T There has also been speculation as to whether the firm is part of a bigger plan by UAE to offset its own emissions. According to the World Bank, Africa represents only five per cent of carbon credits generated under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism while China and India accounted for 67 percent. Carbon credits are traded at the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as well as Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM). Both markets are dominated by large economies, and only a handful of African countries and companies have benefited. Expand projects The global carbon credit market stood at around $950 billion (Sh118 trillion) in 2023, according to Kenya Institute of Public Policy Research and Analsys (Kippra) with the whole of Africa accounting for just 11 per cent in the five years to 2021. The share for Africa has gone up to 16 percent last year, according to ACMI. “Between 2016 and 2021, African countries accounted for only approximately 11 per cent of the total global carbon credits issued, with only two percent of its maximum annual capacity for carbon credits tapped,” said Kippra. According to ACMI, to full benefit from the global carbon credits market, Africa needs to expand the kind of projects being undertaken on the continent. This would mean going beyond cookstoves and planting trees , projects which ACMI noted that are facing global integrity challenges. “Global integrity challenges have particularly strong implications for Africa. These concerns are particularly important in Africa, where REDD+(Reducing Emissions from Forest and Forest Degradation) and cookstove projects comprise almost 90 percent of the past two years’ credit supply,” said the ACMI report. “Both REDD+ and cookstove carbon projects have seen intense global scrutiny over the past year, and together these comprise almost 90 per cent of African credit supply in the past two years. “Numerous specific African projects have come under the spotlight as part of the past year’s intensified scrutiny of credits’ integrity.” It further added that some REDD+ projects have been scrutinised for over stating emission reductions. “Beyond these global issues, Africa also faces unique challenges spanning the carbon market value chain. These include a high investment risk, high upfront costs for project development, and regulatory complexity,” said ACMI. “Some recent trends have sharpened these challenges, such as regulatory decisions that have increased political risk. For example, Zimbabwe’s recent regulatory developments intensified investor speculation that other countries could follow suit and highlighted potential political risk.”",

        "description": "Ford has won bragging rights, with our money, for belatedly delivering on his 2018 campaign promise to make beer available just about anywhere.",
        "content": "Doug Ford has figured out the price of power. Too bad we’re all paying for it. To the premier, it’s small beer — a mere $225 million in subsidies for suds. That’s how much he’s admitted to paying out in taxpayer funds to the big brewers as financial compensation for allowing beer into convenience stores roughly a year ahead of schedule. The political payoff? Ford wins bragging rights, with our money, for belatedly delivering on his 2018 campaign promise to make beer available just about anywhere, anytime. It also buys him the flexibility to hold an early election — not in 2026, as scheduled under Ontario’s fixed election law, but a year sooner. At what price, precisely? By some counts, it is destined be far higher than the purported low ball figure of $225 million — as much as $1 billion, according to opposition critics. Remember “buck-a-beer,” the other cynical slogan Ford dined out on in 2018? It fizzled out fast because that unsustainable price for a can of beer defied common sense and business sense. During his winning campaign, buck-a-beer was twinned with another slogan that was similarly oversold — “beer in corner stores.” Ford knew perfectly well that The Beer Store’s owners could sue the province for defaulting on a binding 10-year contract under which they’d first agreed to relax their grip on the market by phasing in supermarket beer sales. That pioneering framework, negotiated by the previous Liberal government, broke the stranglehold of the big brewers. But it wasn’t good enough for Ford — who always boasts of bettering what came before. Mercifully, Ford’s most influential cabinet ministers managed to talk him out of breaking the beer pact, persuading him that the province faced costly litigation and possible penalties exceeding $1 billion. Yet it always rankled our teetotalling premier that he’d failed to deliver on a forgotten promise. Now, all these years later, he has contented himself with an anticlimactic announcement about an antiquated issue. Belatedly, beer will become more convenient — a mere one year ahead of when it otherwise would have, and four decades after it first became a political issue. Back in the 1980s, the Liberal leader of the day, David Peterson, first promised beer in corner stores but found it inconveniently complicated to deliver on it. Now, it’s a non-issue that no one notices. They’re not even called corner stores anymore. They’re no longer on every corner, not all that convenient, and mostly owned by big chains, not Mom and Pop operators. Which is why Ford’s news fell flat on Friday – flatter than a stale beer washing down a nothing burger. Still, there is good reason to pay attention, for we will potentially be paying far more than Ford pretends. Beyond the stated subsidy of $225 million going to The Beer Store’s owners, another $375 million in fees now paid by them to the LCBO will be rebated. As Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie points out, a wholesale discount of 10 per cent for the big grocery chains — now enjoying record profits — could easily total more than $150 million in lost revenues. If you add in the foregone licensing fees from 8,500 new stores (charged by other jurisdictions), that’s at least $300 million more money left on the table. By Crombie’s count, it adds up to a “billion-dollar booze boondoggle” that is “lining the pockets” of the wealthy and well-connected — an echo of the campaign rhetoric Ford used against the Liberals in 2018. Buy beyond the opposition critiques, there’s also the opportunity cost of spending so much time and money so utterly opportunistically on a faded, defanged oligopoly. Quite apart from financial resources, consider the governmental bandwidth being wasted by a premier who doesn’t touch a drink deploying the best minds in the public service to bringing beer into convenience stores. Imagine if Ford spent more time and money solving real problems rather than creating new ones — dealing with overflowing surgical wait-lists, say, or a housing and homelessness crisis. The speculation is that Ford prefers to gear up for an early provincial campaign to get out ahead of a federal election later that same year likely to crown his Tory cousin, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre as prime minister. The premier is understandably wary of how shabbily the federal Conservatives might treat Ontario as they slash spending. An early election could also allow Ford to dodge the results an RCMP probe into his other boondoggle (that’d be the Greenbelt imbroglio). He might also catch Crombie’s Liberals off guard while deflating the NDP’s Marit Stiles before either gains traction. But it’s a quid pro quo that’s hard to quaff — or swallow: Ford’s fantasy is that by keeping his stale promise on beer in corner stores, he is now free to break the promise of fixed election dates every four years codified in law. Ford’s billion-dollar bet may be one boondoggle too many.",

        "description": "A section of Members of Parliament is reading sinister motives in senators' push to have counties get Sh415 billion equitable shareable revenue.",
        "content": "When Senators engaged in a heated debate over equitable shareable revenue at the Senate chambers. [Elvis Ogina, Standard] A section of Members of Parliament is reading sinister motives in senators' push to have counties get Sh415 billion equitable shareable revenue. Speaking in Navakholo, Kakamega County, Ikolomani MP Bernard Shinali said senators are not sincere in their new push to increase county allocation since the majority of them have declared interest in running for governor in 2027 and they intend to control more resources if elected to office. \"Our senators are speaking the truth and facts that counties need more money but they are not sincere because they have a hidden agenda of giving more money to counties because they want to be governors,\" said Shinali. \"It would be different if our senators would put aside their greed and ask for more money to counties if they had not declared openly that they want to be governors. Most of those pushing for more resources have declared their interest and they want to control more resources when they become governors and that is their main agenda and not more money to help our people,\" he claimed. Vihiga Woman Representative Beatrice Adagala slammed senators saying that the National Assembly will give money to governors based on what is available and not because they (senators) want more allocation to counties with a view of becoming governors. \"We are the ones giving and allocating money to counties and we have seen some senators who are campaigning to become governors calling for more money so that they can be in charge, we shall allocate counties what is available based on the status of our economy not because senators want more resources,\" said Adagala. \"They should tell us how money has been spent in their counties and the level of development, we don't want to give more money and in return, we witness corruption and misuse of public money,\" she added. However, Likuyani MP Innocent Mugabe said counties need to get more money in order to address inequality that has been witnessed in the sharing of national resources. \"We have been experiencing discrepancies in the sharing of national resources across the country because more money is left with the national government and when a new regime comes in power it distributes the resources based on the voting pattern,\" said Mugabe. \"The perceived opposition areas are usually disadvantaged and to end such problems we need to give more money and resources to counties so that our people can easily access resources and get services,\" he added Vihiga Senator Godfrey Osotsi concurred with Mugabe and urged the mediation committee to approve the Sh415 billion as an equitable share to counties. \"Counties need an additional Sh24 billion to achieve and implement new obligations and as senators across the political divide, we are speaking in one voice that we want to hear that the mediation committee has approved the Sh415 billion as proposed and approved by the Senate because counties need more money to realise the fruits of devolution,\" said Osotsi. Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter He told MPs to approve the Division of Revenue Bill that proposes a Sh415 billion allocation to counties to end the notion that lawmakers are enemies of devolution. \"We will support devolution to our last breath and we are working with governors to realise that and we urge our MPs to join us, let them approve the figure and ensure more monies are sent to counties so that they can remove the notion that they are against devolution,\" he said. Senators approved Sh415 billion allocation to counties from Sh385 billion but the National Assembly rejected it and instead approved Sh391 billion which led to a stalemate and the formation of a mediation committee to resolve the issue. The Council of Governors (CoG) criticised MPs for rejecting the Senate's proposal to increase equitable shareable revenue to counties for the financial year 2024/2025 from Sh385 billion to Sh415 billion, terming it a threat to devolution. CoG Finance and Economic Planning Committee chairperson and Kakamega Governor Fernandes Barasa said devolved units require more funds to implement projects and new functions. Governors had demanded Sh450 billion for the coming financial year. “I fault with the National Assembly Budget Committee for rejecting senators’ proposal to increase counties allocation to Sh415 billion. Counties have medical equipment to be serviced and various other duties which have been devolved but not funded and I urge the mediation committee to increase the allocation so that we can be able to handle the new functions,\" said Barasa.",

        "content": "Former Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana and lawyer Maina kiai will lead celebrations to honour literary giant Ngugi wa Thiong'o in Atlanta Georgia. Mkawasi Mcharo Hall, an African study, language and cultures scholar from Washington DC will be among the guest speakers at the fete scheduled for June 22, and organised by the Kenya Diaspora Alliance-USA (KDA-USA). The trio will lead Kenyans and Africans in the Diaspora in the ceremony that is expected to attract 300 people from across the globe to celebrate Prof Ngugi where his remarkable contributions and influence in academia and contemporary culture over the decades will be showcased. Serenading the congregants will be renowned Mugithi artist Kwame Rigii who's songs such as \"Mwene Nyaga\" and \"Iceembe\" have brought him acclaim. Kwame is a talented creative artist who uses song to tell captivating stories of love, spirituality and tradition. His urban folk style of music seeks to inspire the Gikúyú to embrace its identity. Others who have organised the event are Association of Kenyan Diaspora Organisations (AKDO), One Voice Consortium (OVC) and the Kenya Studies and Scholars Association (KESSA). KDA-USA founding president Saisi Marasa said the event will bring together scholars, students, Kenyans and Africans living in America. \"Ngugi has been prolific for six decades, since his first novel, Weep Not, Child was published in 1964. With over 30 books published, spanning multiple genres from novels, to plays, to a collection of poems, children’s literature, essays, some in his native Kikuyu language, Ngugi remains the most prolific writer in Africa,\" Dr Marasa said during a briefing on the event which will be livestreamed globally. \"He is the most deserving, a globally recognised and celebrated author all over the world, but he is yet to be recognised with a commendation by his country of birth. This is a shame. If he dies today, he will be given a state burial,\" he added. KDA-USA founding president said that the fete will be a step towards ensuring that Ngugi’s contribution to Pan-Africanism, quest for an African identity, promotion of the usage of African language and culture are applauded. Mukurima Muriuki, a member of the KDA-USA, said: “In America such people get a Medal of Honor from the President, they get statues and celebrations. To this day, he only has one honorary degree from Kenyan institutions, and not even from his alma mater. At 86, he certainly deserves his flowers.” Muriuki said Kenya owes Ngugi reparations for the time he undeservedly spent in jail, “He had to also go to exile for the sake of a better Kenya. It’s hard to find such a breed. And all he deserves is a thank you,” he said. “Prof Ngugi has forced us to see, or at least debate, a national and indeed a continental failure to decolonise minds. Words from the barrel of Ngugi’s often-acerbic pen have inspired millions to continue wrestling post-independence ills that crush young dreams,” adds author and medical device manufacturing executive Washington Osiro. Hall, a Baltimore-based scholar, says: “Mwalimu’s character lives in culturally identifiable spaces, yet he easily brings it home with global audiences that read and celebrate him, proof that one does not need to abandon their culture to be accepted by others; true to the Swahili adage that mwacha mila ni mtumwa.” Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter The event will be open to women, men and youth seeking to honour Ngugi and his works. Speakers will include his contemporaries in the literature and scholarly fields as well younger generations inspired by the values he espouses. “Deliberate outreach will be extended to his alma maters, universities where he has been a professor as well as Mwalimu’s publishers,” said Dr Marasa. “Mwalimu Ngugi is an academic who has graced the corridors of several colleges. He has received over a dozen honorary degrees from institutions across the globe. He continues to engage, write and teach as opportunity allows,” he added. Marasa said the organisers are open to partnering with different entities and individuals who feel inspired by Ngugi’s works to make “the event as colourful as it can be.”",

        "description": "Where have they come from, and are they cause for concern?The post What Do Aussies Need to Know about COVID-19’s Spicy New FLiRT Variants? appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.",
        "content": "We’ve now been living with COVID for well over four years. Although there’s still much to learn about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) at least one thing seems clear: it’s here to stay. From the original Wuhan variant, to Delta , to Omicron , and several others in between, the virus has continued to evolve. New variants have driven repeated waves of infection and challenged doctors and scientists seeking to understand this changing virus’ behaviour. Now, we are faced with a new group of variants, the so-called “FLiRT” variants, which appear to be contributing to a rising wave of COVID infections around Australia and elsewhere. So where have they come from, and are they cause for concern? The FLiRT variants are a group of subvariants of JN.1 from the Omicron lineage. JN.1 was detected in August 2023 and declared a variant of interest by the World Health Organization in December 2023. By early 2024, it had become the most dominant variant in Australia and much of the rest of the world, driving large waves of infections. As new variants emerge, scientists work hard to try to understand their potential impact. This includes sequencing their genes and assessing their potential to transmit, infect and cause disease. In late 2023 scientists detected a range of subvariants of JN.1 in wastewater in the United States. Since then, these JN.1 subvariants, including KP.1.1, KP.2 and KP.3, have popped up and become more common around the world. But why the name FLiRT? Sequencing of these subvariants revealed a number of new mutations in the virus’ spike protein, including F456L, V1104L and R346T . The name FLiRT was coined by combining the letters in these mutations. The spike protein is a crucial protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 that gives the virus its spiky shape and which it uses to attach to our cells. Amino acids are the basic building blocks that combine together to form proteins and the spike protein is 1,273 amino acids long . The numbers refer to the location of the mutations in the spike protein, while the letters designate the amino acid mutation . So for example, F456L denotes a change from F (an amino acid called phenylalanine) to L (the amino acid leucine) at position 456. The regions of the spike protein where the mutations have been found are important for two main reasons. The first is antibody binding, which influences the degree to which the immune system can recognise and neutralise the virus. The second is virus binding to host cells, which is required to cause infection. These factors explain why some experts have suggested the FLiRT subvariants may be more transmissible than earlier COVID variants. There are also very early suggestions the FLiRT subvariants could evade immunity from prior infections and vaccination better than the parental JN.1 variant. However, this research is yet to be peer-reviewed (independently verified by other researchers). In more positive news, there’s no evidence the FLiRT variants cause more severe disease than earlier variants. Still, that doesn’t mean catching a COVID infection driven by FLiRT is risk-free. Overall though, it’s very early days in terms of published research on these new FLiRT subvariants. We will need peer-reviewed data to understand more about FLiRT’s characteristics. In the US , FLiRT has overtaken the original JN.1 variant as the dominant strain. The latest data from the US suggests the original JN.1 is making up less than 16% of cases. While the FLiRT subvariants were detected in Australia more recently, they appear to be gaining traction. For example, NSW Health data up to mid May showed the proportion of KP.2 and KP.3 samples was continuing to increase. In other parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, the FLiRT subvariants are similarly on the rise . In Australia, as temperatures continue to drop, and we head into the winter months, respiratory viruses commonly increase in circulation and case numbers peak. So it is anticipated that the number of COVID cases will rise. And with the FLiRT subvariants showing evidence of increased “ fitness ”, meaning they present a stronger challenge against our body’s immune defences, it’s possible they will soon take over as the dominant subvariants circulating in Australia. As the FLiRT variants are descended from Omicron, the current booster on offer in Australia, against Omicron XBB.1.5, is likely to offer substantial protection. Although it’s not guaranteed to stop you becoming infected, COVID vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe disease. So if you’re eligible , consider getting a booster to protect yourself this winter. SARS-CoV-2 is now an endemic virus meaning it will continue to circulate around the world. To do this, the virus mutates – usually only slightly – to survive. The new FLiRT subvariants are excellent examples of this, where the virus mutates enough to continue to circulate and cause disease. So far there is no suggestion these subvariants are causing more severe illness. It’s more likely they will cause people to catch COVID yet again. While the information we have at this stage doesn’t give us significant cause for concern about the FLiRT variants specifically, we are nonetheless facing rising COVID infections once more. And we know people who are older or vulnerable, for example due to medical conditions that compromise their immune system, continue to be at greater risk.

The underfire dancer, 33, who is being investigated by the BBC over his behaviour on Strictly , was with his girlfriend at a retreat in Oxon. But he was back in a rehearsals yesterday with Anton , ahead of their summer tour. Strictly judge Anton showed no signs of concern for working with Giovanni as he said: “First day of rehearsals, always my favourite day.” Giovanni added “it feels nice , it’s lovely” to be back in action. The Sun recently revealed a BBC investigation into Giovanni had been told he sent a celebrity dance partner an offensive video clip . The broadcaster’s team were presented with the new claim as they look into the Strictly pro’s workplace conduct. Giovanni is alleged to have sent the clip via WhatsApp ahead of filming one of the live Saturday night shows. He did not make, commission or appear in the video. The BBC has launched an internal investigation after receiving complaints from his previous dance partners, including TV presenter Laura Whitmore and actress Amanda Abbington , who are being represented by lawyers. A source said: “The BBC was told about the video clip and that someone found the content completely inappropriate, grossly offensive. \"The BBC was told the celebrity was shocked and upset to receive it on a WhatsApp message, hours before the couple were meant to be dancing together on live television. “They were told they felt intimidated by it. The women are being incredibly brave in speaking out, especially as a lot of them are going up against vicious messages from his loyal fans.”",

        "description": "Target seems to be falling behind Walmart in the U.S. market.",
        "content": "Target ( TGT 0.57% ) recently posted its latest earnings report. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on May 4, the retail-giant's revenue fell 3% year over year to $24.53 billion but still roughly matched analysts' expectations. Its comparable-store sales dropped nearly 4%, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of declining comps. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) dipped 1% to $2.03 and missed the consensus forecast by $0.02. Target's stock stumbled after that disappointing report -- extending its 36% decline over the past three years -- as Walmart 's ( WMT 0.83% ) stock rallied 37% during the same period. Let's review the four reasons Walmart outperformed Target by such a wide margin. 1. Superior scale and diversification Target operated 1,963 stores at the end of the first quarter, but all of them were located in the United States. Walmart is a larger and more broadly diversified retailer that operates 10,607 stores and numerous e-commerce sites across 19 countries. In the U.S. market, it operates 4,609 Walmart stores and 599 Sam's Club stores. Walmart's international business owns Flipkart, one of India's largest e-commerce marketplaces, and a major stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com . Its Sam's Club business competes against Costco in the membership-driven warehouse club space . That scale and diversification makes Walmart a safer long-term retail play than Target, which is heavily dependent on the U.S. market. Both companies are countering Amazon by turning their own brick-and-mortar stores into fulfillment centers for online orders, but Walmart has a much larger network of stores than Target. 2. Better comps growth Target's comps fell 4% in fiscal 2023 (which ended in January 2024), as it struggled with inflationary headwinds for consumer spending and theft and safety issues. This led to the closures of some of its smaller-format stores. The company also suffered from a boycott by conservative groups in response to some controversial products in its Pride Month Collection. Target generates a lower percentage of its sales from groceries -- which are more resistant to macro headwinds -- than Walmart. In the most recent fiscal years, groceries accounted for 23% of Target's sales and 60% of Walmart's U.S. sales. Walmart also faced inflationary headwinds, theft-related issues, and a few political-driven boycotts over the past year but fared lot better than Target. In fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Walmart's U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose nearly 6%. Sam's Club posted nearly 5% comps growth on the same basis, while its international sales grew 11% in constant-currency terms. The company's total revenue rose 6% for the full year. For fiscal 2024, Target expects its comps to only rise 0%-2%. For fiscal 2025, Walmart expects its consolidated net sales to come in at the \"high-end or slightly above\" its original forecast for 3%-4% growth. 3. Superior earnings growth As Target's growth cools off, it's limiting its markdowns and cutting costs to boost its EPS. But despite those efforts, it only expects adjusted EPS to increase by a midpoint of 2% this year. Walmart, which is also streamlining its spending to counter the macro headwinds, expects its split-adjusted EPS to rise by a midpoint of 4% this year. 4. It deserves its higher valuation Based on those estimates, Target might seem like the cheaper play at 16 times this year's earnings. Walmart trades at 28 times forward earnings . Target's forward dividend yield of 3.1% is also higher than Walmart's 1.3% yield. However, Walmart deserves that higher valuation because it's better diversified, comps are rising, and it's generating strong earnings growth. Walmart's U.S. growth also suggests that Target is suffering company-specific challenges. Walmart will likely stay ahead of Target Walmart and Target both survived the retail apocalypse, which wiped out many of their brick-and-mortar peers over the past 14 years. They also grew through the COVID-19 pandemic by keeping their stores open and selling more products online. But today, Target is gradually falling behind Walmart in the U.S. market. It doesn't sell enough groceries to offset the inflationary headwinds and is exposed to the faster-growing overseas e-commerce and warehouse club markets. Therefore, I believe Walmart will continue to outperform Target by a significant margin for the foreseeable future.",

        "content": "Hit Man Review: An Outrageously Awesome Rom-Com of Sorts By Richard Linklater is back with what may be his most entertaining movie. He’s consistently produced fantastic works in many different genres for decades. He co-writes and directs , a romantic crime comedy of sorts. Glen Powell co-writes and stars in the film as Gary Johnson, a college professor who works part time with the New Orleans Police Department. He works undercover posing as a hitman so that his “clients” who try to hire him end up getting arrested. But when a woman named Maddy Masters (Adria Arjona) hires him to kill her husband, things become quite interesting. Hit Man works so well on every level. It’s genuinely a riot from start to finish. There isn’t a dull moment in this film. It’s exceedingly rewatchable, especially with large groups of people. Although this movie will land on Netflix’s streaming platform soon, it is playing in a few theaters and I’d recommend seeing it in one. This movie is an absolute blast and there are so many things the film has going for it. For one, the premise feels very fresh. Although the movie hits many familiar beats surrounding love stories harmed by a fake identity, the particular approach and style this movie has makes it feel unique. The reason to see this movie is Glen Powell. He has been working his way to stardom for many years, having had small roles in Spy Kids 3D and The Dark Knight Rises. And ever since I (and others) saw him on the big screen in Top Gun: Maverick, we knew that was a movie star in the making. He followed that up in 2023 with the theatrical box office hit Anyone But You. Although that movie was very successful and is a shining example of a rare theatrical rom-com, Hit Man is everything that I wanted that movie to be in terms of quality. This film takes the conventions of a romantic comedy and puts such a fun spin on it, while Anyone But You stuck to the formula too much. When Gary meets Maddy, he’s undercover, playing a hitman. There’s a wonderful idea here because in real life, Gary is a bit of a boring nerd. But when he’s playing this hitman persona for Maddy, he’s attractive, confident, and many things that he usually isn’t. That puts an interesting spin on their romance because she has no idea who he really is. As they spend more time together, we get a sense of their chemistry. And while Powell was leaning into the affair rumors with Sydney Sweeney to help promote his previous rom-com, the chemistry is even better in this movie. It’s funny, lovely, and very sexy. Arjona enchants the screen unlike any other as Maddy, and although she’s had roles in films like Triple Frontier and Morbius, this was my first time taking full note of her ability. It’s safe to say that with the upcoming Twisters, Monsanto, Edgar Wright’s Running Man reboot, and JJ Abrams’s next movie, Powell has become Hollywood’s new hot ticket. He’s booked and busy as ever, and it’s wonderful to see him reteam with Linklater. The actor/director duo had previously worked together on Everybody Wants Some!! and Apollo 101⁄2: A Space Age Childhood. They’ve collaborated on a screenplay built for Powell’s talents. The fun thing about Gary is the fact that he plays various hitmen and he plays them all as very different characters. He has to play a redheaded sociopath, he needs to do a Russian accent, and for one of them, he does a spot-on impression of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Not only are all these hitmen characters hilarious, but they quickly show you Powell’s range and comic ability. But above all else, Hit Man is a rom-com. This movie is quite funny, even if it can feel at one point like the hitman story comes to a halt. It spends a sizable amount of time with Gary and Maddy. Linklater is no stranger to romance with his pitch-perfect Before trilogy, but there are times in Hit Man where it feels like the relationship’s focus is more sexual than a deeper connection. It may anger the prudish “unnecessary sex scene” Twitter users but this is a sexy film all while giving you a strong hook. Halfway through the film, the storyline surrounding the romance becomes tied to a storyline surrounding real killing. That’s where the movie becomes both gripping and outrageously humorous. The story gets very investing once this shift happens, and there are many scenes in Hit Man that put the biggest smile on your face as a result. It knows how to put the audience a step ahead of some supporting characters while making us suspicious of other characters. Seeing Gary find himself in over his head as he needs to maintain the illusion of who he is despite never killing anyone is quite amusing. That’s what makes Hit Man such a special movie; it’s darkly funny, it has a killer ending, and it’s a well-paced movie with a strong flair from Linklater. Don’t miss it. As ComingSoon’s explains, a score of 8 equates to “Great.” While there are a few minor issues, this score means that the art succeeds at its goal and leaves a memorable impact. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films. Share article Related",

        "description": "A B.C. Supreme Court justice and about a dozen lawyers couldn't proceed with murder and murder conspiracy cases May 27.",
        "content": "Murder and a murder conspiracy cases were delayed in B.C. Supreme Court May 27 due to a shortage of sheriffs that continues in B.C. despite the attorney general’s assurances it is being dealt with. Justice Kathleen Ker came into court to hear the two cases but had to leave as there was no sheriff. Sheriffs are required in courtrooms to provide security for proceedings. They also move prisoners around courthouses and transport them to court. About a dozen lawyers, including four publicly paid Crown prosecutors, were left milling around outside the courtroom at the Vancouver Law Courts on Monday. One case involved an appearance by Pascal Jean Claude Bouthillete. He and Sandy Jack Parisian were accused in the death of 78-year-old Usha Singh. Singh, who lived alone, was found badly beaten in her house on Jan. 31, 2021. Vancouver police said two men gained entry to Singh’s Little Mountain home around 6 a.m. by posing as police officers. Singh succumbed to her injuries in hospital two days later. Parisian and Bouthillete were arrested on Feb. 3, 2021. The conspiracy to commit murder case involves multiple accused. Two men are facing the court together while a third is facing the charges separately. Due to a series of publication bans in the case and the separate trials, Glacier Media has chosen not to publish details at this time. Court delays in B.C.’s justice system due to sheriff shortages have become more common in recent years. Thirty-one courtrooms were closed in Abbotsford, North Vancouver, Port Coquitlam and Surrey between Aug. 14 and Sept. 13, 2023. Earlier in 2023, sources told Glacier Media courtroom closures included those in Vancouver, Abbotsford, Port Coquitlam, Surrey, Victoria, Chilliwack and Kamloops. Concerns have already been expressed before judges and by judges that delays could begin to hamper people's right to a trial within a reasonable time period. This comes before the courts as lawyers begin mentioning the application of the so-called Jordan principles whereby that right is upheld. The Jordan principles stem from a case that wound up in the Supreme Court of Canada. Stays of proceedings are possible if a case hits a ceiling of 18 months for those tried in the provincial court and 30 months for cases in superior courts. On the May 27 Vancouver Provincial Court list alone, there were 32 cases listed in excess of 300 days (or nearly 10 months). “Delay attributable to or waived by the defence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling,” the high court said. Attorney General Nikki Sharma has acknowledged the problems created by the shortage and stressed the provincial government is working on recruiting new sheriffs. In February, Sharma announced the addition of 13 new deputies . \"Everyone who uses the court system expects it to run safely and smoothly,\" Sharma said in a statement at the time. \"Sheriffs provide critical protective and enforcement services for the judiciary, Crown, defence, court staff and the public. That's why it's so encouraging that more people than ever are applying to join the BC Sheriff Service.\" The new deputies will fill positions in Oliver, Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria and the Lower Mainland, Sharma said. Getting those recruits to courtrooms, however, does take time as they need to undergo training at the Justice Institute of BC. Glacier Media has reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on the May 27 proceedings.",

Online shopping The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers' perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. \"Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn't rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,\" said Merline McGregor, General Manager of Pattern Australia. \"With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells.

Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon's Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform's advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia, 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process - significantly more compared to any other single marketplace.

        "description": "Officers cleared in January death",
        "content": "Langley RCMP officers would have acted illegally if they took a man into custody for threatening suicide because he convincingly claimed otherwise, B.C.’s Independent Investigations Office (IIO) has ruled. The man, identified only as AP, killed himself a few days after police visited in January. A Monday, May 27 decision released by the police watchdog shows officers visited AP twice after he texted his mother to say “I am done and I can’t do this anymore” and she contacted RCMP to advise her son had attempted suicide in the past. During the first visit by an RCMP officer on Jan. 10, AP insisted he was “merely expressing frustration at academic studies in which he was engaged, as well as other difficulties in his life,” the IIO review summarized. A previous IIO statement said AP was living in the 20200 block of 66th Ave. at the time. AP said he was taking his medications properly, showed the officer the meds “laid out in an orderly manner” and agreed to call for help if he required it. Less than an hour later, a social worker reported receiving emails from the man threatening suicide. When two Langley officers returned to his home later that day, AP insisted the email was referring to actions to be taken in the future, in the event of his death, “not a plan to die shortly.” He had been drinking, and one of the officers convinced him to pour out the remaining alcohol to avoid further escalation, the report said. According to the RCMP members, AP was “evidently intelligent and insightful, was able to respond to all their concerns, and all their questions in a plausible and reassuring manner.” On Jan. 11, an officer spoke with the AP’s mother, who later told the IIO she did not have any concern that he was in immediate danger of self-harm at that time. Another family member, who spoke with AP that same day, said there was “no suggestion that he was in imminent danger.” But when the mother was unable to contact her son, police returned to the home on Jan., 14 and found AP dead from apparent suicide. IIO Interim Chief Civilian Director Sandra J. Hentzen ruled the officers “did everything they reasonably could to test him for present suicidal intention and he passed the tests. It appears that not only was [he] able to conceal his true intent from the police, but he was also able to deceive close family members in the time between the officers’ visits and his eventual death.” Officers did not have sufficient grounds to apprehend AP under the Mental Health Act based on their personal observations,” Hentzen said. “It would in fact have been unlawful for them to proceed with an apprehension and it was appropriate for them not to do so.” Accordingly “the matter will not be referred to Crown counsel for consideration of charges,” Hentzen ruled.",

        "content": "National Grid, one of the two surviving listed companies from Thatcher’s privatization of the electricity industry, is a giant firm that owns the electric transmission systems of England and Wales, electricity distribution networks in England, Wales, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, as well as gas storage facilities and renewable resources. National Grid, like most utilities normally is in the headlines only when the lights go out. However, the company recently shocked the investment public when it announced financing for its £60 billion five-year capital spending program. The company intends to raise £6.8 billion by selling discounted common stock in a rights offering (7 new shares for every 24 owned) to its shareholders, which will increase the number of shares by roughly 29%. This is a monumental offering by European standards. Now for the bad news. In order to save cash for the big spending program, the company will “rebase” ( euphemism for “reduce”) the common stock dividend so dividend outflow remains the same despite the higher number of shares outstanding. Not exactly share-owner-friendly. But let’s be frank. Income-seeking investors with a low appetite for risk hate dividend cuts. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} Financing the £60 billion capital program, we estimate, might look roughly like this (rounded): rights offering £7 billion, depreciation £12 billion, retained earnings £4 billion, sale of assets £4 billion, debt and other £32 billion. That’s a lot of debt, but that is not what shocked the market. It was the size of the stock issue combined with a dividend cut. National Grid stock fell 20% in three days. Yet, even on a “rebased” basis, with a 4% dividend and a likely 6% growth rate, National Grid, to us, looks like a reasonable value. Stated differently, current income of 4% plus earnings growth of 6% suggests an implied total equity return for this company of 10%. That has traditionally been a very attractive level for a regulated utility. Maybe we are missing something. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} But we aren’t planning to discuss National Grid’s prospects or its communications with share owners, but rather to point out that National Grid's capital program will lead to growth in capitalization of roughly 10% per year. But like many utilities, its internally generated funds might only furnish less than one-third of the money needed for its capital program. American utilities, with increasing capital programs for electrification, are headed in the same direction in terms of spending and financing. The only difference is that US companies will not sell one huge equity offering but rather a number of smaller ones. The end result is the same in terms of equity dilution but equity investor’s feelings are less ruffled this way. Big electric utility spending plans will become commonplace. So will frequent common stock sales. Get used to them. And finally, shareholders of a properly regulated US investor-owned utility do not suffer meaningful earnings dilution when the company sells a considerable amount of common stock. Quite the contrary. Earnings can grow by a lot because regulators authorize rate increases that permit actual eps growth. Bottom line? Income-oriented investors react emotionally to dividend cuts. Let’s put it this way. A decently run utility with a 10% total return potential should not be sold. By Leonard S. Hyman and William I. Tillles More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",

        "content": "The Young Bucks are happy with the first five years of AEW. On the anniversary of their first ever show, the brothers teamed with Kazuchika Okada and Jack Perry to pick up a famous win. They beat FTR , Bryan Danielson and Darby Allin in the Anarchy in the Arena match, in one of the show’s main event. The Young Bucks spoke on the AEW Double or Nothing 2024 post-show media scrum . They spoke with Renee Paquette , bemoaning her not being in the company for the whole five years. They then revealed that they feel good about the last five years, especially after their win over Team AEW at the pay per view. Matthew Jackson said “Coming off a big W for us, Team Elite, so it feels good,” Matt Jackson said. “I’ve got good match syndrome, I feel good about it. I feel good about five years. It’s crazy walking these halls. You weren’t here, Renee. In the beginning. But we were; I don’t know if anyone else in the room was either, but we certainly were. But five years ago, we started this company called AEW. We designed the logo, we created the entire thing.” The Young Bucks Named The Show In A Group Chat The Young Bucks then spoke about how they named both AEW and Double or Nothing. Nicholas Jackson said “We named the show”, before Matthew Jackson continued. He revealed it was their idea, while talking in a group chat with Tony Khan. He also named the wrestlers in the back as “ungrateful”, before calling their matches “unbelievable. “In a group chat with Tony Khan, it was our idea. And it’s just cool to come back here and just feel that presence, feel that nostalgia, you know? And see a lot of familiar faces, people that aren’t around all the time. I just — what we accomplished here in AEW, I said this in an interview recently, it’s unprecedented. I feel that there’s a lot of ungrateful folks, some people in this room.” “A lot of people in the locker room, a lot of people out there tonight. What we’ve done in five years, no other company — no other wrestling company, certainly, has ever done. And I think that sometimes you’ve gotta stop and smell the roses, and go ‘Look at what we’ve done! Look at the PPVs we’ve had. Look at the in-ring matches that we’ve had.’ This is unbelievable!” This article first appeared on Wrestlezone and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Former President Trump is talking about flipping blue-leaning states in his already tight race with President Biden for the White House. Trump and Biden are — including , , and — but the former president’s campaign contends that traditionally bluer states are also in play. In recent weeks, he’s set his sights on Minnesota and Virginia, states that voted against him in both 2016 and 2020 — but where some polls now suggest the two are just a few points apart. Polling would likely still need to shift more in Trump’s favor to make these states more realistic, but there are some signs that they could eventually be on the table. Here are seven blue states that Trump is hoping could flip red in November: Although it last voted for a Republican in a presidential election more than half a century ago, Trump has often named Minnesota as a state where he can expand his map on the way to winning the presidency. And it may be one of the most likely places for him to flip if the election were to seriously tilt in his direction. The state polling average from Decision Desk HQ/The Hill is based on relatively few polls, but Biden only leads by just more than half a point there. An internal poll taken from the end of last month to the start of this month from the Trump campaign had the former president leading by 3 points, while another independent poll showed Biden leading by 2. Trump nearly won it in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton by less than 2 points, the closest margin of victory for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1984. But Biden comfortably carried it in 2020, winning by 7 points. Trump had vowed to win the North Star State in 2020 and said he’s “never coming back” if he loses it. But Trump returned to the state earlier this month for the state GOP’s Lincoln Reagan Dinner, falsely claiming he won Minnesota in 2016 and 2020. Democrats in the state have meanwhile brushed aside a potential upset, with Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) Trump is “grasping at straws.” The Granite State has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000, but it has regularly had one of the closest margins in the past few decades. The state was Hillary Clinton’s closest margin of victory in 2016 at less than half a point. Biden greatly improved the margin in 2020 with a 7-point win, but polling so far indicates a closer race could be in store. The handful of polls taken have mostly shown Biden up, but only by a few points. He leads in the DDHQ/The Hill polling average 48.5 percent to 44.5 percent and led by the same margin in one poll from this month. But another poll this month from NH Journal/Praecones Analytica of a three-way race that includes independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. showed Trump just ahead , though well within the margin of error. Biden has made a couple visits to New Hampshire on the campaign trail, most recently Tuesday for an aimed at veteran health care. Trump may have to turn more attention to the state to break the Democratic trend in presidential elections, but the state has regularly been in conversations as a battleground this century. Biden beat Trump in Virginia by nearly four years ago — and four years before that, the Old Dominion was the with Clinton. But this year, the former president has set his sights on flipping the state . Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita told the Biden campaign is “deliberately playing a faux game” in its such as Florida and North Carolina, but argued the former president has “a real, real opportunity in expanding the map in Virginia and Minnesota.” The campaign pointed to internal surveys that reportedly showed Biden with a small edge in Virginia. Polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill put Biden up less than 2 points, with around 46 percent to Trump’s 44 percent. A Kennedy’s campaign to lay out how the independent could reach 270 electoral votes found Trump up 1 point over Biden in a Virginia head-to-head, , while Kennedy’s presence on the ballot shifted the state into Biden’s column. Maine is even more on the further reaches of the map for Republican presidential candidates, having not voted for one since 1988, but it’s not completely inconceivable if the election moves toward landslide territory. A Pan Atlantic Research Omnibus Poll found Trump ahead of Biden by 6 points among Maine voters, with 38 percent to Biden’s 32 percent — while “another candidate” scored 21 percent, and 9 percent said they were undecided, as reported by . Another poll from last month’s Kennedy-associated poll placed Trump ahead of Biden by less than 2 points. With Kennedy in the mix in a three-way race, the polling showed Biden would win Maine, according to the Kennedy campaign. Trump has not appeared to talk about winning Maine this cycle, at least yet, but in August 2020 that he should carry the state that year. Biden won it by 9 points. Trump is on trial in New York in a historic case centered on a hush money payment made amid his 2016 campaign, but he’s nevertheless projecting confidence that he can win over the deep-blue Empire State in 2024. “I think we have a chance to win New York. It hasn’t been done in, you know, many, many decades. As a Republican, I think we have a very good chance. When you see the crowd, nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told “Fox and Friends” in an interview aired Friday after he held a rare rally in the Bronx. “And we’re going to win New York. And if we win New York, the election’s over. We take over the country. We take over the country.” Polling has shown Biden predictably ahead in New York, which has voted blue in presidential elections for more than three decades running — but one puts Biden’s lead in the single-digits, with 47 percent to Trump’s 38 percent. The 45th president’s New York City event Thursday underscored how he is working to drum up support in the Democratic stronghold. The rally came on the heels of stops in the blue states of Minnesota and New Jersey. The Garden State appears to be another long shot Trump is trying to make in November. “We’re going to try and win the state of New Jersey. I want the people to know that. It’s not just going to be like, ‘Gee, maybe we can get close.’ We’re going to win it,” Trump on NJ101.5. That’s an ambitious goal in a state that Biden won by , and which has gone to Democrats in every presidential race since it backed Bill Clinton in 1992. Little polling has been done on how a Trump-Biden rematch would fare in New Jersey this time around, but the former president has nevertheless been optimistic about the possibility of a flip. “As you can see, today, we’re expanding the electoral maps because we are going to officially play in the state of New Jersey,” Trump told the crowd at a Jersey Shore rally earlier this month, as . “We’re going to win the state of New Jersey.” New Mexico was among a handful of states that Trump back in January he may be “foolish” to make a play for, but planned to do so all the same. “One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years: Minnesota,” Trump said. The Land of Enchantment last voted for a Republican president in 2004, and though Trump tried his hand at last cycle, Biden won in 2020 by roughly . Polling in the state has been sparse this cycle, but another recent Kennedy-sponsored survey shows a in the state.",

        "content": "Just under a month ago, Enzo Maresca won the Championship title in his first season as Leicester City boss. The Italian will compete in the Premier League next term but instead of doing so with the Foxes , he's set to take his expertise to Chelsea . talkSPORT understands that the Blues want to hire Maresca as their successor to Mauricio Pochettino after his mutually-agreed exit. Leicester's current head coach is on course to be the third permanent appointment at Stamford Bridge since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital completed their takeover in 2022. Their first was former Brighton boss Graham Potter , someone that their potential new head coach is very familiar with as they spent around a year-and-a-half together at West Brom . Maresca was 18 years old when he joined the Baggies and learned a new culture in England, but it seems as though Potter gave a helping hand. “When you move from, in my case Italy to England directly to Birmingham, you can adapt immediately to the language and to the country,\" he said in Manchester City's feature about him. “My English was not so good and also I learned a lot when I was there, though I struggled a bit at the beginning but after it worked quite well. “When I first joined the club, Denis Smith was in charge as manager then Brian Little came in for the second year. With both of them I was very happy. They helped me a lot in terms of adaptation to the life and the football. I was happy there. “I also remember sharing lifts to training with Graham. We played together, we lived very close so sometimes we travelled together in the car to the training ground.\" In September 2022, over two decades since he and Maresca left West Brom as players, Potter was named as Chelsea's new head coach. He came in to replace Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel and was quick to make an impression as he won six of his first nine games. However, Potter was dismissed just seven months later and weeks before the Blues finished a dismal Premier League season in 12th. With Maresca now set to be Chelsea's next permanent boss following Pochettino's departure, he'll hope he fares better in the dugout. The west London side have spent around £1billion on transfers since their takeover two years ago but are yet to win any silverware. Chelsea finished sixth this season and qualified for the Europa Conference League ahead of the new campaign, one that fans will be desperate to see more progress in. Maresca will arrives with previous Premier League experience as one of Pep Guardiola's coaches in City's treble-winning season. Championship title success came his way at Leicester when he left the European champions, with the job at Chelsea a reward for his success. However, taking the reigns at a Blues side who are so desperate to win trophies against will come as a whole new challenge and step up for Maresca next season.",

        "description": "Buyers are more concerned about current property market conditions than those looking to sell, a ...The post Buyers more apprehensive than sellers amid interest rate uncertainty appeared first on realestate.com.au.",
        "content": "Buyers are more concerned about current property market conditions than those looking to sell, a new survey from realestate.com.au shows. The latest Residential Audience Pulse Survey, conducted in April, found fewer buyers are feeling optimistic about purchasing a home, with the number of respondents saying now is a 'good time to buy' down 1% compared to the same time last year, at 35%. In contrast, those believing that now was a good time to sell jumped 24% on last year, at 41%. The main driver of buyer concern is the fact that 62% of respondents are either very or slightly concerned about interest rates. There are mixed forecasts as to where interest rates are headed in the near future, causing buyers to be more wary of entering the market at the current time. Additionally, one in five respondents said that they were experiencing mortgage stress as a result of increased interest rates pushing up monthly home loan repayments. One of the main drivers of high seller sentiment is that sellers perceive prices as being good at the moment, with one in four perceiving that prices are high. This is likely a reason why buyers are deterred from entering the market, as higher prices coupled with higher interest rates make buying more expensive than two years ago. More property seekers are pessimistic about the market than sellers. Image: Getty. This trend is especially pronounced in Western Australia, where survey respondents believing now was a good time to buy dropped by 11% to 21% in April. Home values in Perth have grown by 20.16% in the past 12 months, higher than all other cities and regional areas . This, coupled with low stock, has put additional stress on the budgets of Perth buyers. Half of buyers in WA believed that we will see price and rate increases in the next six months, a sharp increase on the same time last year. Respondents from Queensland and South Australia also had high concerns for price and rate increases, likely due to high price growth already seen in Brisbane and Adelaide in the past 12 months. For those currently in the buying process, the main reason was for a lifestyle change, such as living in another area. A 41% increase was seen in buyers wanting to move to a different area, mostly driven by respondents in New South Wales, QLD, and Victoria. Older respondents (aged 50+) were more likely to favour a lifestyle change and were also looking to retire, downsize, and/or sell. The current property market is marked by high buyer concern due to rising interest rates and property prices, while sellers are experiencing strong sentiment due to favourable selling conditions. This has led to a cautious approach from buyers, particularly in high-growth areas like Perth, and a notable shift towards lifestyle-driven relocations among older demographics.

        "content": "Baillie Billy Buchanan says he is very upset the plan won’t be taken further “after years of support and pressure”. Falkirk Council’s director of place services, Malcolm Bennie, confirmed that Transport Scotland was not willing to back the project which has been talked about for more than a decade. In 2019, it had seemed that the plans were on track as campaigners celebrated the news that Falkirk Council would support plans for a new train station to be looked in a Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidelines (STAG) report. At the time, the campaign group Reinstate Bonnybridge Train Station – whose convener Bryan Deakin went on to become a councillor – said it was “a massive step in the right direction”. But following the review, the Scottish Government, through Transport Scotland, decided it would not support the business case to reopen the station. Having asked Mr Bennie for a report that would “update the community”, Baillie Buchanan was dismayed by a reply that made clear it will not be taken forward. Baillie Buchanan said: “For some time I have been asking for a report on the Bonnybridge railway station proposal a full report to come to council to ensure the whole community knows its not forthcoming. “The contents of the reply clearly shows this present council has binned the project. “I am really upset that after years of support and pressure there is no support from the Scottish Government and now this council has finally admitted no more money or officers’ time is to be wasted. “The dream has gone – for now!” A spokesperson for Falkirk Council said: “Falkirk Council undertook a comprehensive review into the potential to re-open a rail station at Bonnybridge. “Following consultation, Transport Scotland confirmed that there was no compelling business case for this project to go ahead and it would be highly unlikely to gain their support. “As a result of this, it would be difficult for the council to justify using already limited resources to progress any part of this scheme and we have no plans to bring forward any further reports at this time.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "AMITE, La. (AP) — Authorities in south Louisiana searched Monday for two of four men who escaped a parish jail through a perimeter fence. Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards said the four inmates fled the facility through a section of the fence that “was found to be vulnerable and easily maneuvered in such a way that a small statured body could slide through.” Earlier Monday, authorities found two of the escaped men — Avery Guidry, 19, and Travon Johnson, 21, both of Natalbany — hiding in a trash bin behind a store in Amite, Edwards said. The other two — Omarion Hookfin, 19, of Hammond, and Jamarcus Cyprian, 20, of Amite — remained on the run, he said. The sheriff’s office said Johnson, Hookfin and Guidry were in jail following their arrest for a 2022 homicide in Hammond, while Cyprian was serving time for armed robbery and weapon charges. Hookfin also acquired additional charges of aggravated battery while jailed in a separate case in Catahoula Parish, authorities said. Edwards urged anyone with information on the whereabouts of the remaining escaped inmates to contact emergency authorities or call CrimeStoppers of Tangipahoa’s anonymous tip line at 800-554-5245.",

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz MONTREAL — CAE Inc. says it lost $484.3 million in its fourth quarter, compared with profits of $101.9 million a year earlier. The Montreal-based flight simulator maker says revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $1.1 billion, down from $1.2 billion during the same quarter last year. Its loss per share was $1.58, compared with earnings per share of 29 cents a year earlier. Last week, the company said it was expecting a loss of this magnitude due to a $568-million \"goodwill impairment\" for its beleaguered defence business. The company said it is making some changes, including a few moves in its upper ranks and operational changes. On Monday, president and CEO Marc Parent said the company took the \"necessary steps\" toward improving CAE's margins in defence, and now has a \"more balanced risk profile.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz MONTREAL — CAE Inc. says it lost $484.3 million in its fourth quarter, compared with profits of $101.9 million a year earlier. The Montreal-based flight simulator maker says revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $1.1 billion, down from $1.2 billion during the same quarter last year. Its loss per share was $1.58, compared with earnings per share of 29 cents a year earlier. Last week, the company said it was expecting a loss of this magnitude due to a $568-million \"goodwill impairment\" for its beleaguered defence business. The company said it is making some changes, including a few moves in its upper ranks and operational changes. On Monday, president and CEO Marc Parent said the company took the \"necessary steps\" toward improving CAE's margins in defence, and now has a \"more balanced risk profile.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "NEW YORK - Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly US$17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. Top sports headlines, all in one place \"I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,\" Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers' series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. \"Now that I've been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn't affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.\" In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees' Aaron Judge and Houston's Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 -- his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium -- when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. \"It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,\" Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. \"It's getting better day by day. It's definitely -- today is a lot better than yesterday.\" Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn't run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App \"Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,\" he said. \"But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.\" \"Obviously, the legs -- isn't that great, but I don't personally think it's affecting the swing,\" Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn't play the next day. \"I feel pretty good with the back. I've been working out and making sure that's in a good place,\" he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He's not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. \"A starting pitcher can tell you that there's a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,\" Ohtani said. \"So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I'm really just focused on just progressing every day.\" He hasn't concluded whether his offence has improved because he isn't pitching. \"It's hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,\" Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 m.p.h. from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. \"Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,\" he said. \"I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there.\"",

        "description": "The Marlins will have a week to trade him or pass him through waivers.",
        "content": "The Marlins announced that infielder Xavier Edwards has been reinstated from the 60-day injured list and optioned to Triple-A Jacksonville. To open up a spot for him on the 40-man roster, right-hander Eli Villalobos has been designated for assignment. Edwards, 24, battled a foot infection during Spring Training and began the season on the injured list. He has been playing in rehab games for over a week now and is healthy enough to be activated, though he only played seven games on his rehab so the club will keep him on optional assignment for regular playing time in Jacksonville. Though he won’t be joining the active roster, the Fish needed to make a corresponding 40-man move since Edwards was on the 60-day injured list, which will nudge Villalobos off his spot. The right-handed Villalobos is about a month away from his 27th birthday. The Marlins claimed him off waivers from the Pirates last June but then passed him through waivers about a week later. He got his 40-man roster spot back earlier this month and was able to make his major league debut. He made three appearances for the Marlins, allowing one earned run in 4 1/3 innings, before being optioned back to Jacksonville about two weeks ago. In addition to that small sample of big league action, Villalobos has also thrown 18 innings over 13 Triple-A appearances this year with a 4.50 earned run average. He has struck out 26.5% of batters faced at that level and kept 44.7% of batted balls on the ground, but he’s also walked 13.3% of hitters that have stepped to the plate. That has generally been the recipe for Villalobos. Dating back to the start of 2021, he has tossed 196 innings in the minors with a 3.72 ERA. His 29.4% strikeout rate in that stretch is quite strong but he’s also given free passes at a 12.2% rate. The Marlins will have a week to trade Villalobos or pass him through waivers. He can still be optioned for the rest of this year and one additional season, which could perhaps give him appeal for a club that is intrigued by the strikeouts and willing to wait to see if the control improves. If Villalobos were to pass through waivers unclaimed, he would have the right to elect free agency by virtue of his previous outright.

        "content": "Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract with Aston Villa following a stellar season with the club. Emery led Villa to fourth-place finish in the Premier League, thereby taking them into next season’s Champions League. The 52-year-old Spaniard has turned Villa around since his transfer from Villarreal, with the club sitting 17th in the Premier League when he arrived in October 2022. He led them to seventh place in his first season in charge and fourth this campaign. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club,” said Emery, whose existing deal still had another three years to run.

And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. “We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams.” Former Sevilla and Arsenal boss Emery also took Villa, the 1982 European Cup champions, to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season in their first European campaign for 13 years. Chairman Nassef Sawiris said: “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "Marcus Rashford is planning to take some time to reset mentally after acknowledging he has endured a “challenging season”. The England forward was left out of Gareth Southgate’s training squad for Euro 2024 after scoring just eight goals in all competitions for a struggling Manchester United side who finished eighth in the Premier League. But after helping his club end the season on a high by beating Manchester City in Saturday’s FA Cup final , the 26-year-old will now look to make the most of his summer of rest. Manchester United sound out Roberto De Zerbi about becoming new manager Read more As he announced his decision to step away from his social media accounts for a few weeks, Rashford – who last month said “enough is enough” after receiving online abuse – responded again to his critics. He wrote on X : “It’s time to come off socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. “Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t, just remember at United, we always stick together.” Rashford’s teammate Luke Shaw did make Southgate’s provisional squad despite injuries restricting him to only 15 appearances for United this season, the last of them in February. The full-back has addressed criticism over his apparent availability for his country, but not his club. Shaw posted on Instagram: “I don’t normally react to things I see on social media, but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. “The reality is I am not 100% fit for either right now, but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.” skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Football Daily Free daily newsletter Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 28-year-old France international joined the club in a £36m move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on Instagram, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under Erik ten Hag. In 2019, during Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "content": "George Mallory, the greatest British mountaineer of his day who died on Everest in 1924, replied \"because it is there\" when asked why he wanted to climb the highest mountain in the world. Last week Cheruiyot Kirui died just below the summit of Everest trying to climb it without oxygen. He was a banker with KCB, not a professional climber, but he was following his dream. He was close to the summit of 8,849 metres but apparently started suffering from altitude sickness and disorientation in the 'death zone' above 8,000 metres where oxygen becomes very scarce. Only three percent of Everest summits are made without oxygen. It was ambitious to climb Everest without oxygen as he had only previously climbed Kilimanjaro and Mt Kenya (many times). But, as the saying goes, it is better to try and fail than not to try at all. He paid with his life but he proved that Kenyans are brave and intrepid. He flew the flag high. We can all be proud of him. The best way to remember him is for us to follow our own dreams, even if they sometimes seem crazy and dangerous.

        "description": "After being eliminated from the Big East tournament in excruciating fashion, the UConn baseball team chose to take the bus home from Ohio, and the healing began. Now the Huskies have a fresh start in the NCAA Tournament, the sixth bid in a row for the program.",
        "content": "STORRS — There wasn’t a whole lot to say, but a whole lot to think about. The UConn baseball team , after dominating the Big East all season , took an early, rather unceremonious exit from the conference tournament. After failing to get the winning run in from third with no outs in the ninth, they lost to Xavier in 11 innings , the completion of a suspended game. Then after leading four different times, they lost to Georgetown in 10 innings . It was double-elimination, two-and-out in a matter of hours last Thursday. They tried to get an earlier flight home, but couldn’t and Coach Jim Penders decided the Huskies, who’d been away from home a week and a half, had enough of hotels. So the players and coaches were going to board the bus in Mason, Ohio, on Friday morning and ride home, a good 14 hours with a couple of stops. “The first couple of hours were a little bad,” senior pitcher Garret Coe said , “it was still stinging a little, but being around each other for that long was probably good for us.” On everyone’s mind: Was the season over? Were the seniors’ careers over? Had this one terrible day wiped out months of accomplishment? Or would the Huskies gather on Monday get a reprieve from the NCAA and a ticket to the Field of 64 ? “Personally, I was very confident, I think the coaches were pretty confident, I’m pretty sure everyone was pretty confident we would get a bid,” said catcher Matt Garbowski , a junior. “Because we deserved it.” Penders, his son, Charlie, and the assistant coaches had to sweat out the weekend, wondering if upsets in the other conference tournament’s would kill UConn’s chances for an at-large bid. “I was rooting for Duke (to win the ACC Tournament) for the first time in my life,” Penders said, not to mention Arizona, Louisiana Tech and a few others.. By Monday morning, things looked good. And when the team gathered in the lounge at the Toscano Family Ice Forum, the Huskies learned a few minutes into the selection show that they will be heading to Norman, Okla. — by plane — to face Duke, oddly enough, in the first round of the Oklahoma Regional on Friday. The host Sooners will play Oral Roberts. “They’ve survived,” Penders said. “They’ve been resilient, they found a way to fight, they won every Big East weekend.” UConn (32-23) started out the season 9-15, taking its lumps against top-level competition in the Southeast and on the West Coast. After a particularly tough loss at Cal-Santa Barbara, pitching coach Josh MacDonald admonished the players, “We’re not going to quit on you, don’t quit on us.” The Huskies hit their stride in Big East play, going 17-4 to win the regular-season title by three games over St. John’s, which won the automatic bid. They were No. 41 in RPI, right on the borderline in the selection committee’s key metric, but two things were in their favor: Conference series, which weigh more heavily than midweek games, and reputation. In the past, particularly 2017, reputation worked against UConn, as it often does for teams in this part of the country. Northeastern, despite a mid-30s RPI and two midweek wins over UConn, was snubbed Monday. But UConn, with 10 tournament appearances since 2010, became the first team from New England to go to the NCAA six years in a row. The program won a regional at Maryland two years ago, and has proven itself as a national player. “Coach Penders said it best,” Coe said, “a lot of times in selection shows in the past, when we didn’t have the automatic bid, it didn’t fall in our favor, it wasn’t necessarily about us getting in. It was about those other guys who were passed over, not given another chance. Finally, UConn’s got the respect to go show it.” During the Big East tournament, freshman pitcher Tommy Turner, who tells teammates he watches the runner on every home run, shouted into the dugout that a runner missed second. With nothing to lose, Penders asked for a review, which showed the runner had hit the center of the base hard enough to raise dust. “They were saying, ‘Has Penders lost his mind?'” Penders said. “So on the bus, I got up, and said, ‘Tommy, what did you see? The guy not only touched the bag, he came down right in the middle of it?’ And everybody laughed.” The gloom began to lift. From there, the long ride through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut felt normal, guys playing their video games, reading, bonding again, healing. “And when we got home, we showered and washed it all off,” Coe said. Along the way, Penders glanced down at his phone and read an email from a fan on the Connecticut shoreline who described himself as an “old timer,” who listened to every pitch of every UConn game. It was a long message of encouragement, not the kind of anonymous, what-were-you-thinking stuff a coach might see at such moments. Penders responded with a long message of thanks, promising the fan that his team would stay “in the arena” and fight, and he would be right there with the Huskies. Then as the bus was arriving in Storrs, Penders read the emails to his team. “It was pretty impactful,” Garbowski said. “Coach was saying he usually gets a bunch of emails from no-names saying, ‘You guys stink, you guys stink,’ and he just deletes them right away. This one stuck with us. When he read to us, it made me feel good about myself and I’m sure a lot of other guys, to know there are people out there who have your back and support you no matter what the guys are going through.” The challenges ahead next week, Duke, Oklahoma, are massive. The “Road to Omaha” is long and filled with them. Any and all positive re-enforcement will come in handy.",

        "content": "The latest season of AMC's Interview With the Vampire has successfully recreated the iconic Théâtre des Vampires, a key element from Anne Rice's 1976 novel. Production designer Mara LaPere-Schloop, drawn to the artistic promise of creating the Théâtre des Vampires and its coven, found her satisfaction in Season 2. \"More than anything, I really wanted to sink my teeth into this theater and the coven,\" LaPere-Schloop told Variety . Theatre des Vampires debuted in Season 2 The Théâtre des Vampires made its first appearance in the second episode of the new season. The plot follows characters Louis, played by Jacob Anderson, and Claudia, portrayed by Delainey Hayles. They join a coven that lives openly in Paris as a grotesque theater troupe. The series has updated Rice's original setting from the 1800s to the 1940s, featuring the coven putting on blood-splattering performances that captivate a desensitized post-World War II audience. 'Gothic in tone, but not necessarily in a historic way...' To achieve the desired atmosphere, the series required a space that served as an \"unapologetically\" and \"insatiably indulgent oasis for the campy coven.\" LaPere-Schloop and showrunner Rolin Jones aimed for a setting that was gritty yet entrancing. \"Gothic in tone, but not necessarily in a historic way,\" LaPere-Schloop explained, adding, \"More of a turn-of-the-century industrial space with gothic fingerprints on it.\" They discovered the ideal location in an old factory in Prague—one of many European sites scouted for S02. Projection animation used in the coven's performances In the depths of the backstage, LaPere-Schloop's team personalized each vanity for the coven members. The series's most significant mid-century upgrade to Rice's creation is the projection animation used in the coven's performances. This early cinema expressionism style—created in partnership with the London-based theater troupe 1927—charts the passage of time as Louis and Claudia fall deeper under the coven's spell. \"The projections kind of start monochromatic and then, as time passes, we start to see color bleed in,\" LaPere-Schloop explained. Series explores omitted elements from the original novel The series delves into a crucial part of Rice's 1976 novel that was left out from the 1994 film adaptation: Louis and Claudia's quest for other vampires. This journey forms a significant part of the first two seasons' 15 episodes. Jones previously mentioned, \"We always thought this would be a lovely little gift for fans...We focused on the relationship...and how we foreshadow an inevitable ending but do it with a moment of grace.\" It is now streaming on AMC+.",

        "content": "Shareholders have expressed readiness to massively support and mobilise for the ongoing recapitalisation of Fidelity Bank Plc amid commendations for the impressive performance of the bank over the years. Shareholders were unanimous that Fidelity Bank has shown strong resilience over the years and demonstrated its investors’ friendliness with significant dividends and capital gains. Shareholders, under the auspices of Nigeria’s leading shareholders’ associations, said they would buy into any share offering by Fidelity Bank as the bank holds exciting future for above-average returns. The sundry shareholders’ endorsements underlined market pundits’ expectations that Fidelity Bank would easily raise additional funds and retain its status as one of Nigeria’s leading commercial banks with international authorisation. With nearly 400,000 shareholders, Fidelity Bank has the most diversified retail shareholders’ base among Nigerian banks. No single shareholder held up to 5.0 per cent of the issued share capital of the bank. Five per cent and above are considered the material shareholding under extant laws and market regulations. The highly diversified shareholding base, while it has its challenges of corporate register management and stock volatility, shows Fidelity Bank as a popular stock. Its huge free float also underscores the pricing efficiency of the stock at the stock market, ensuring that the share price is a reflection of the bank’s fundamental and investors’ expectation. National Coordinator, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Mr. Moses Igbrude, said Fidelity Bank has shown that shareholders can trust it for sustainable growth and returns.",

        "content": "FILE - New York Mets’ Kodai Senga, of Japan, pitches during the first inning in the second baseball game of a doubleheader against the Miami Marlins, Sept. 27, 2023, in New York. Senga faced hitters Monday, April 29, 2024, for the first time since hurting his shoulder, throwing 21 pitches of live batting practice against minor leaguers at Citi Field. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Injured New York Mets pitcher Kodai Senga is upset he hasn’t been able to help his team this season. “It’s obviously not ideal, a lot of regretful feelings,” he said through a translator on Monday before New York’s series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers was rained out. “I just want to get back out there. I’m here at the stadium. I see all the guys fighting, and it really makes me want to have the urge to go back out there and pitch for the team.” Senga joined the Mets ahead of the 2023 season for a $75 million, five-year contract and became an All-Star in his first season. He went 12-7 with a 2.98 ERA in 29 starts and finished second in NL Rookie of the Year voting. “It’s hard to put a timetable here,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “We got a pretty frustrated player here that he’s not able to contribute to the team.” Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said Feb. 15 that an MRI revealed a capsule strain in the pitching shoulder of the 31-year-old right-hander, a scan performed after Senga twice expressed having shoulder fatigue following throwing sessions. Senga pitched batting practice once in late April and again in early May. He said he needed to work on his mechanics and reported triceps tightness during the road trip that ended last week. Another MRI on Friday showed nerve inflammation in Senga’s right elbow. “When your muscles are not moving the way they’re supposed to, then a lot of different things could get inflamed and it happened to be the nerve this time,” Senga said. He received a cortisone shot on Friday and likely will resume throwing on Wednesday. Senga sounded dispirited over his rehab. “I think that I understand my body well and I think things could have gotten better,” he said. “I’m not overly surprised of where I am. I think I could have fixed some things.” He was concerned about the progression of his return. “In order to get back to 100%, you have to hit each benchmark,” he said. “It’s not one specific thing that caused everything.

        "description": "Injured New York Mets pitcher Kodai Senga is upset he hasn’t been able to help his team this season. Sidelined since spring training, Senga says “it’s obviously not ideal, a lot of regretful feelings.\" Senga joined the Mets ahead of...",
        "content": "\"It’s obviously not ideal, a lot of regretful feelings,\" he said through a translator on Monday before New York's series opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers was rained out. “I just want to get back out there. I’m here at the stadium. I see all the guys fighting, and it really makes me want to have the urge to go back out there and pitch for the team.\" Senga joined the Mets ahead of the 2023 season for a $75 million, five-year contract and became an All-Star in his first season. He went 12-7 with a 2.98 ERA in 29 starts and finished second in NL Rookie of the Year voting. “It’s hard to put a timetable here,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “We got a pretty frustrated player here that he’s not able to contribute to the team.” Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said Feb. 15 that an MRI revealed a capsule strain in the pitching shoulder of the 31-year-old right-hander, a scan performed after Senga twice expressed having shoulder fatigue following throwing sessions. Senga pitched batting practice once in late April and again in early May. He said he needed to work on his mechanics and reported triceps tightness during the road trip that ended last week. Another MRI on Friday showed nerve inflammation in Senga’s right elbow. “When your muscles are not moving the way they’re supposed to, then a lot of different things could get inflamed and it happened to be the nerve this time,” Senga said. He received a cortisone shot on Friday and likely will resume throwing on Wednesday. Senga sounded dispirited over his rehab. “I think that I understand my body well and I think things could have gotten better,\" he said. \"I’m not overly surprised of where I am. I think I could have fixed some things.” He was concerned about the progression of his return. “In order to get back to 100%, you have to hit each benchmark,\" he said. “It’s not one specific thing that caused everything. But just moving forward, I think I have to look forward and bang out each thing that I need to do in order to move on to the next step and ultimately get back to on the mound.” New York waited an extra two weeks before Senga resumed throwing. “We laid out a plan when he first went down in spring training,\" the manager said. “Everybody was on board.

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? It may be one of the oldest homes in Winnipeg — and was even built by the grandson of one of the original Selkirk Settlers — but even a heritage advocate admits it would be better if it was demolished and replaced by two new homes. The Polson House, at 94 Cathedral Ave., which is named for its first owner, has been vacant so long it would cost more than what it’s worth to make it livable again. While the city’s director of planning, property and development has given permission for a new developer to create two residential lots on the site, the decision has been appealed and will be heard Wednesday. Cindy Tugwell, Heritage Winnipeg’s executive director, co-signed a letter supporting the demolition and opposing the appeal earlier this month, but said she isn’t happy about the situation. “It’s a classic ‘demolition by neglect,’” said Tugwell. “The property is now very derelict and you can do the math. When it reaches a certain state, it is too cost-prohibitive to do it. If it’s $150,000 to fix, versus the cost of demolition, it doesn’t make sense. “You would never make any money if you sold it.” While the house has history, the city has placed it on its historical commemorative list, which means there are no protections on it at all. Tugwell said many residents in the area want to see it torn down. “The house is beautiful. It’s a 19th-century home and it fits on the streetscape so well. But I also feel sorry for the neighbours who have had to look at this blight every day. And it has become a safety issue, too,” she said. The sole appellant is Gillian Crawford, a community member who sits on the Seven Oaks House Museum’s board. She said she lives on Cathedral Avenue and recognizes the safety and cost concerns related to the house. She called her appeal a “last-ditch effort” to see if the home could possibly be moved or any other action could be taken. “I’m not necessarily against developing the spot, housing is super important, and we want to have people moving into the community.... I was just really hoping if there’s any last way that if the house could be saved, I just wanted to bring that forward,” she said. She said she hoped that, if the demolition does go through, the neighbourhood is able to forge a relationship with the developer. “I don’t know the developer, and I’m not saying that they wouldn’t be responsible. But in the North End, you don’t have to look far to find infill housing that is boarded up, as well,” she said. Tajinder Pal Singh, who heads Anand Infrastructure and Consulting Ltd., is the developer on the proposed demolition and new build. He said the current owner bought the building in 2023 and costs to repair and bring the house up to code could be upwards of $350,000. “Nobody’s going to pay us for that much renovation costs... if the (city) wants to give us $350,000 to restore it, why not? We’d take that,” he said. He said the building has been vacant for about five years. A previous developer convinced the city to allow the lot to be split into two in 2021, but that agreement lapsed when nothing went forward. Singh consulted Heritage Winnipeg and the Seven Oaks Historical Society before making any decisions and provided a tour of the house and an estimate from a contractor. He also got the thumbs-up from several neighbours in the surrounding area, he said. The new properties will feature a commemorative monument that documents the history behind the Polson House “Even if we can have a stone or something engraved, we’ll do that,” he said. Seven Oaks Historical Society president Kenneth Ingram called the demolition “the best possible result of a worst-case scenario” for a part of Winnipeg that isn’t given the attention it needs from city leadership. “The North and West Kildonan and Old Kildonan, has just been a part of the city that’s been neglected for years, and because of it, a lot of our history and our historical buildings are no longer standing,” he said. He said the support from his organization was contingent on the developer’s willingness to consult with people in the area. “Through our dealings with that developer, he’s basically done virtually every possible thing to ensure that the history of this house is preserved in some shape or form,” he said. “This is going to be an issue that’s that’s only going to increase over the coming decades, and a lot of these older houses are the ones that are vulnerable.” The house was constructed in 1894. It was first owned by Alexander and Jesse Polson. Alexander Polson was a city inspector and while Jesse was known for her charity work through St. John’s Cathedral. Their children lived in the house as late as 1957, when it was sold. Local historian Christian Cassidy described the house as lively — one of the Polson sons started a radio station there in 1911, and it had long been host to community gatherings and events. “For Cathedral Avenue, this would have been one of the social hot spots of the neighbourhood,” he said. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. The situation is a double-edged sword in Cassidy’s view: a community with aging housing stock will benefit from two new up-to-code units, but as the city’s focus on infill housing grows, more buildings of this type will be lost. “These are issues that are going to come up more and more with the push and the extra funding for densification of housing, incentives for infill housing, in these older neighbourhoods,” he said. “This is going to be an issue that’s that’s only going to increase over the coming decades, and a lot of these older houses are the ones that are vulnerable.” kevin.rollason@freepress.mb.ca malak.abas@freepress.mb.ca Kevin Rollason is one of the more versatile reporters at the Winnipeg Free Press.Whether it is covering city hall, the law courts, or general reporting, Rollason can be counted on to not only answer the 5 Ws — Who, What, When, Where and Why — but to do it in an interesting and accessible way for readers.

        "description": "Does Arnold Schwarzenegger's massive FUBAR Season 2 action figure look more like the actual star, or a legendary lumberjack?",
        "content": "I’m not going to lie to you fans of the smash hit Netflix series FUBAR who are reading, the news that Season 2 is in production is basically the news you came here to read. And normally, this would be the sort of thing you’d hear announced in a press release, with some teasing quotes about how the season ahead will be “its biggest yet.” Of course, when you’re talking about anything actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is connected to, that’s not enough. No, the hype train for his seemingly spiritual sequel to True Lies actually just broke a Guinness World Record with a giant action figure, which may not quite look like the actor all that much. We can specifically thank the world’s biggest Arnie action figure for that new, aforementioned record. Even if the footage shown below makes the art piece look more like a Paul Bunyan tribute than the former Governator of California. Check it out in the Instagram post below: A post shared by Netflix US (@netflix) A photo posted by on Now, that is one big pile of plastic. And you know something, considering Arnold Schwarzenegger's track record with celebrating , I'm starting to think he doesn't suck at it as much as he claims. The numbers behind this mammoth promotional device certainly back that hypothesis. For reference, the tiny action figure that Arnold Schwarzenegger uses as the initial reference for this FUBAR promotion stands at 5.52 inches. Sitting on the other end of the spectrum of extremes, the large and in charge Arnie towered at a height of 22.14 feet (265.7 inches), as it was shown off at the ShowFX campus in Santa Fe Springs, California. That’s almost fifty times taller than the more shelf friendly version. On one hand, I can definitely see where some might not feel this is the best rendering of Mr. Schwarzenegger’s unique facial features and may favor Paul Bunyan a bit more. But, at the same time, at least from where I’m standing, that massive FUBAR promotion bears a better likeness to Arnold Schwarzenegger than the last gargantuan item to bear his visage. Anybody else remember the infamous inflatable that helped promote Last Action Hero ? Try taking a look at that mega media move below, from back when Schwarzenegger’s most underrated role was touted as “the hot ticket of ‘93,” and tell me we haven’t advanced as a species: A post shared by American Cinematheque (@am_cinematheque) A photo posted by on Arnold Schwarzenegger loves talking a big game, but the FUBAR star loves living up to the hype even more. Which is why his claim that “next season’s action figure will be twice as big” give me pause. And, quite frankly, I’m sure the folks at Netflix’s marketing team are also having a bit of a concern. Based on what we know, that figure would theoretically stack up to 44.28 feet (531.4 inches), and would probably require Tom Cruise ’s assistance to assemble properly. And, given what we don't know, the cost would probably be so massive that it might figure into the calculations the studio undergoes in order to decide if FUBAR Season 3 is even going to happen! If you thought it was difficult to get the A-lister's face right on the scale we’re currently dealing with, that moonshot of an action figure would be practically impossible. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News But that’s just Arnie for you, as he’s all about doing it big, and doing it right. Sadly, all of this big talk doesn’t change the fact that we don’t have a release date for FUBAR Season 2. But the 2024 Netflix movie and TV schedule is still full of action, adventure, and other excitement to partake in.",

        "content": "MONTREAL — Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme ForThé in Quebec's Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. \"All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,\" he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they're investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had \"disappeared.\" Ruel didn't say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. \"You can't move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,\" he said in a phone interview. Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. \"There's a lot of emotion, because even if it's a new business, it's still all the work and the life savings,\" he said. \"To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.\" Fortin says it isn't easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it's not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he's heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren't insured against theft. If not, he says he'll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. \"For sure it's very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we're restarting at zero,\" he said.

He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. \"There's a lot of emotion, because even if it's a new business, it's still all the work and the life savings,\" he said. \"To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.\" Fortin says it isn't easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it's not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he's heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren't insured against theft. If not, he says he'll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. \"For sure it's very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we're restarting at zero,\" he said.

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday, a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win.

        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final.

        "description": "Van Dijk is about to enter the final year of his current Liverpool contract",
        "content": "Sport | Football Virgil van Dijk revealed he has held talks with new Liverpool boss Arne Slot , as he confirmed his commitment to captaining the club next season. Slot faces the difficult task of replacing Jurgen Klopp at Anfield, with the Dutchman leaving Feyenoord and signing a three-year contract to become Liverpool’s head coach. Klopp has backed his replacement to succeed, leading Liverpool fans in chanting Slot’s name after the final match of the Premier League season against Wolves, and Van Dijk has also thrown his support behind his new boss. The 32-year-old does, however, faces an uncertain future at Liverpool, as he enters the final 12 months of his current contract. Van Dijk recently stated “nothing is on the table” in terms of a new deal, confirming no progress had been made in discussions. As it stands, the centre-back will be able to leave the club as a free agent next summer, but he has made it clear he intends to be a Liverpool player at the start of the new season, with Slot assuring him the captain’s armband will not be changing hands. “That felt good,” Van Dijk told NOS when asked about talks with Slot. “We discussed everything. About the squad, but also about my personal situation. I am and will remain the captain and still have one year left on my contract.” Trent Alexander-Arnold , currently Liverpool vice-captain, is also out of contract at the end of next season, with no update given on any progress in talks over an extension. The 25-year-old, like Van Dijk, attended the Monaco Grand Prix over the weekend, and he was asked whether Liverpool can expect it to be a smooth transition under Slot. “I hope so, I have trust in the club and who we've appointed,” Alexander-Arnold said. “As a player, that's all you can ask for: to have trust in what the higher-ups have brought in. I'm sure it will be a smooth transition.” Transfer news LIVE!

        "content": "Following the first epic semi-final of the week, we have our first two Britain’s Got Talent finalists. Simon Cowell , Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon , and Bruno Tonioli returned to their judging duties tonight as eight acts took to the stage, all hoping to win over the public. These acts were: Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust, and Innocent Masuku. However, only two could go through to the final, and they were Innocent Masuku and Ssaulabi Performance Troupe. Opera singing powerhouse Innocent received the most votes from the public, sending him straight through after an incredible closing performance. Meanwhile, dog act The Trickstars and martial arts stars Sslaubi Performance Troupe found themselves in the top 3, meaning the judges had the power to choose who went through. While the panel heaped praise on both acts, it ended up being a clean sweep, as all four voted in favour of Ssaulabi Performance Troupe. This means they now have a chance to follow in the footsteps of last year’s winner, comedy clown Viggo Venn. Alas, dog training act The Trickstars suffered yet another blow, as she noted it felt like a repeat of 2016 ‘all over again’, when she also failed to make it to the final. In true BGT style, semi-final week kicked off in utterly chaotic style. Britain's Got Talent star is unrecognisable – and glam to the max – 13 years later BGT auditions conclude with appearance from rarely-seen family members Ant McPartlin reveals Simon Cowell sent him special gift after son's birth Britain's Got Talent fans shocked as four familiar faces return for mind-blowing audition We had rollerblading daredevils Stardust dragging judge Bruno on stage and suspending him in the air as part of their act, plus Sven running riot with his air guitar.

        "description": "Indigenous and critical race approaches to narratives of the Middle Ages help reveal more accurate histories, and combat the misuses of ‘the medieval’ for hate.",
        "content": "The seemingly fantastical world of the Middle Ages has held western popular culture in fascination since (at least) its nostalgic reimagining by Victorian antiquarians . European medieval imagery or narratives, partly popularized in the early to mid-20th century, with works like J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings , still permeates popular culture. “The medieval” is used to evoke both magical stories for all ages, and mature stories featuring senseless violence . Unfortunately, there is also a sinister side to our collective love affair with knights and dragons of yore. White nationalist and alt-right groups have taken up the stories, imagery and histories of what is popularly imagined in the West as the Middle Ages to visualize the existence of a homogeneous white Europe , whether imagined as fully Christian or neo-pagan Europeans. Read more: Understanding the Crusades from an Islamic perspective Revisiting the meaning of the Middle Ages, and how medieval imagery and narratives are appropriated and understood today, is therefore necessary for an accurate snapshot of the European and global historical period, and its misuses . As a scholar raised as a member of the Métis Nation in B.C. (though my current documentation is insufficient for citizenship), some of my work has been concerned with what it means to decolonize medieval studies. With literature professor Elizabeth Edwards, I have examined how medieval studies can gain insight from Indigenous worldviews and perspectives . Here, I consider the impact of white supremacy on historical and contemporary scholarly and popular understandings of the Middle Ages, and focus on how scholars are shifting the narrative with critical race and Indigenous approaches. Critical race scholars like Dorothy Kim and Eduardo Ramos have highlighted the colonial histories of medieval studies and its associated myths and stereotypes. As critical race literature scholar Matthew X. Vernon notes in The Black Middle Ages: Race and the Construction of the Middle Ages , white supremacist theorists have seen medieval England as “available for being imaginatively constructed as an era of racial purity and military subjugation on ‘foreign peoples.’” Such “extrapolations of the Middle Ages” have served to “racializ[e] bodies and then fi[x] horizons of expectations for what a race could achieve.” Medievalist scholars Mary Rambaran-Olm and Erik Wade note that some American and English writers rebranded “Anglo-Saxon” to include false narratives around white racial superiority . This use has perpetuated false ideas of what it means to be “native” to Britain, and by extention to claim special “white” belonging and rights in settler colonial societies. The idea of the Middle Ages is arguably tightly interwoven with settler colonial ideology . Indigenous and non-Indigenous with a decolonial focus have begun to understand the European medieval period through global historical and Indigenous perspectives . How have Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars approached the Middle Ages from a decolonial lens? 1. Red Reading “Red Reading,” a form of literary analysis that uses Indigenous approaches and methodologies to read non-Indigenous texts, was first coined by Jill Carter (Anishinabek), and simultaneously developed by Scott Andrews (Cherokee) . In my own work, I read texts like The Book of Margery Kempe , a fifteenth-century text of a mystic’s life and personal relationship with Jesus Christ, to understand how authors incorporated elements of oral storytelling into their written work, not as a an accident of progress but as a purposeful, artistic choice. 2. Examining settler colonialism emerging in premodern history Tarren Andrews (Bitterroot Salish), a literature scholar, revisits origins of colonial narratives . Her scholarship examined male heterosexual and patriarchal control over women in the English poem of The Wife’s Lament written around the 10th century, and how this cultural impulse would manifest in the sexism of the 1867 Indian Act . Read more: Disenfranchising Indigenous women: The legacy of coverture in Canada She’s focussed on legal and literary artifacts from before 1100 from the North Atlantic alongside stories or documents from Turtle Island (North America). 3. Deconstructing Norse contact on Turtle Island The field of medieval studies had long considered itself immune to the need for decolonial work, as it imagined itself to exist prior to European contact with Indigenous societies beyond Europe — other then a brief interaction between the Indigenous peoples of Newfoundland and the Norse. This contact was immortalized in the archaeological site of L’Anse-Aux-Meadow in Newfoundland, now a national historic site , and sagas (such as the Greenlander Saga and the Saga of Erik the Red). Literature scholars like Geraldine Heng have examined interactions in the saga to interrogate how notions of race were developed and depicted in pre-modern times. Christopher Crocker, a Qualipu Mi’kmaw scholar of medieval and modern Icelandic literature, notes how the fascination with Norse contact dominates Newfoundland tourism and historical research — at the expense of pre-colonial Indigenous studies and representation. 4. How colonial rhetoric imagined Indigenous Peoples as “medieval” Some scholars, like sociologist Daniel S. Goh or post-colonial medievalist scholar Helen Young, examines how discussing and framing Indigenous people as “medieval” (backward) has been key to colonial projects . Medievalism was used to justify racist colonial projects as necessary to allow the “medieval” Indigenous societies to “catch up” with supposedly superior European societies . 5. Indigenous adaptations of medieval literature English literature scholar Jonathan Hsy’s Antiracist Medievalism highlights how Indigenous poets have appropriated medieval poetry styles, as part of decolonial literary movements. Hsy showcases the work of Osage medievalist, Carter Revard, who studied, translated and wrote in the Old English Riddle style . This style was a popular form, written from the perspective of an object, such as a sword or book, to reveal itself to the audience. Alongside his translations, Revard wrote some riddles from the point of view of an eagle fan or birch canoe, as an act of reclaiming both halves of his identity — the Osage and the European. Work related to decolonizing the study of the Middle Ages is beginning to take root . I hope this thinking, and the thinking of other scholars, can inform what is taught in classrooms. This can help students carry forward new understandings as they both create and consume medieval-themed images, games, videos and narratives.",

        "content": "When Netflix’s hit series Bridgerton returned for its third season, fans eagerly anticipated the latest romantic escapades and societal intrigues of the Bridgerton family and their peers. However, one noticeable absence was Charithra Chandran‘s character, Edwina Sharma, who had played a significant role in the second season. Recently, Chandran opened up about why Edwina did not return, shedding light on the creative decisions behind her character’s journey. Chandran’s portrayal of Edwina Sharma in the second season captivated audiences with her grace, vulnerability, and the complex dynamics between her, her sister Kate Sharma (played by Simone Ashley), and Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey). Edwina’s storyline, which revolved around a complicated love triangle, culminated in her stepping back to allow her sister and Anthony to embrace their true feelings for each other. In an interview with the Indian Express in 2022, Chandran reflected on Edwina’s character, saying starring in Bridgerton “is absolutely a burden and a blessing. I think it’s about picking diverse roles that are really different from it and building out a career that doesn’t rely too much on the flagship show that launched me. But I’m so grateful for it. It was such a wonderful experience and I have great things to say about it.” She added, “I’m not on set for season 3. I’m doing another film. It hasn’t been announced yet. It’s really exciting!” Over the past one and a half years, she has announced many projects, including producing a reality show based on the Kama Sutra. She is also set to star in Arzu, a drama based on the novel of the same name, as a young Indian heiress who leaves Mumbai for New York City. She also starred in the film How To Date Billy Walsh, which premiered on Prime Video last month. The actress was aware that the success that came with Bridgerton could be fleeting. “I’ve potentially had the biggest success, in my professional life, in the second thing I’ve ever done,” Chandran said in an interview. She continued, “I’m not saying I’ll never do anything grander than Bridgerton. I hope that’s not the case – and I have big ambitions. It’s just rather bizarre that it was the beginning of my career. I think it has really warped my sense of achievement.”",

        "description": "The Fountain Fund, launching in Boston in July, will offer low-interest loans of up to $15,000 and financial planning for formerly incarcerated residents.",
        "content": "When Herby Caillot was released from the Massachusetts prison system in 2019 after serving 22 years for first-degree murder, he had to start from scratch to establish himself financially. He had been locked up since he was 17 years old and had never paid a bill or used a credit card. The bank across the street from his mother’s house in Brockton wouldn’t let him open a checking account; car dealerships turned him down for financing. “Without any credit history,” he said, “nobody’s even looking at you.” People who have been incarcerated face numerous challenges when they return to society, especially when it comes to getting a job and finding a place to live. Sometimes a few thousand dollars can make all the difference, providing a way to buy a car to get to work or put down a security deposit on an apartment. But with a criminal record and no recent employment or credit history, many lenders won’t approve funding, or will only grant it with a sky-high interest rate. Some people have had their identities stolen while they’re behind bars, making it even more difficult to establish credit. Advertisement A nonprofit being launched in Boston in July, with help from an investment by the GreenLight Fund, aims to fill this need by offering low-interest loans of up to $15,000, along with financial planning and community support, for formerly incarcerated residents. Boston will be the fifth market for the Fountain Fund , which was founded in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., and has issued 500 loans — typically for a three-year term with 5 percent interest — totaling more than $2.25 million. Applicants with any type of conviction are eligible, but they must have a job that will allow them to pay back the loan and show that the funds will provide a “potential elevation in their personal circumstances,” such as paying off a debt, getting their car insured, or starting a business. Advertisement Orlando Barbour used his $15,000 loan to buy a box truck and equipment to start a moving company in Charlottesville, Va. Barbour, 32, served five years for selling cocaine and meth, and now has two full-time employees. But getting the loan didn’t come easy, he said. He had to show pay stubs from his job driving a bread delivery truck and present a business plan for his company, Smoov Moving, complete with financial projections. The loan gave him a running start, he said, but the support the nonprofit gave him, along with the networking opportunities, was just as important: “Just having someone who believes in you.” The Fountain Fund staff reviews applicants closely, examining their income and monthly bills before presenting cases to a loan review committee made up of formerly incarcerated people and community leaders, said Jay Vilar, the former program director at Haley House in Boston, who was just named director of the local Fountain Fund. The money is paid directly to landlords, car dealerships, and other vendors, said Vilar, 45, who lives in Roxbury and has an older brother who has been in and out of prison. The nonprofit also partners with community organizations that provide financial literacy training for loan recipients, each of whom must complete an FDIC financial education course online. At Haley House, a nonprofit that runs a soup kitchen and provides other social services, Vilar oversaw a re-entry program for recently incarcerated residents and found plenty of assistance but nothing that gave them immediate access to money. This can drive people to fall back into their old ways to survive, he said, causing them to end up back in prison. Advertisement Many of those who have served time can’t rely on relatives for financial help, said Kristine McDonald , a Brockton attorney who works with people returning from incarceration through the Massachusetts Communities Action Network, a network of faith-based leaders and community organizers dedicated to economic justice and racial equity. “This is a demographic that has been denied generational wealth,” she said. “All of the economic injustices that have been perpetuated for generations and generations of Black and brown people are very much at play.” When Dormen Lisby first tried to buy a car after serving 26 years in prison in Pennsylvania, the dealership would only offer him financing with a 25 percent interest rate. So Lisby, who lives in Philadelphia, turned to the Fountain Fund, which gave him a $13,000 loan — with 3 percent interest — to buy a 2014 Nissan Maxima. Lisby, 52, uses the car to get to work as a program specialist for Shining Light, a nonprofit that provides re-entry programming inside prisons, and take his mother to the hospital for cancer treatments. He also uses it as a “tool of wellness,” rolling down the windows, cranking up the stereo, and going wherever he pleases. Advertisement “To be able to drive,” he said, “is the ultimate expression of freedom.” Katie Johnston can be reached at katie.johnston@globe.com . Follow her @ktkjohnston .",

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",

The 46-year-old royal stunned in a Summer ensemble, sporting a baby blue floral dress midi dress with matching blue heels. Her frock, which featured a gathered design around the lower waist and short sleeves, bore an elegant botanical print with pink flowers and green leaves. Mother-of-three Victoria co-ordinated her dress with a simple pair of heeled pumps in a matching shade of blue. She wore her brown locks pulled into a chic low bun, and opted for a natural make-up look, with a clear complexion, light eye-make-up, and a pink lip. Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden (pictured) was stylish in a baby blue dress featuring a botanical print as she visited The Nordic Museum in Stockholm today The royal (pictured) paired the elegant midi dress with a pair of simple heeled pumps in the same shade of blue The finishing touches to her ensemble included a few pieces of carefully curated jewellery. Among them were a classic silver wrist watch, a platinum ring on her ring finger, and a pair of colourful statement earrings, which matched the palette of her dress. Victoria was greeted at the museum's entrance by its director Sanne Houby-Nielsen, ahead of her attendance at the Friends of The Nordic Museum and Skansen at The Nordic Museum meeting. The royal has been a member and First Honorary Member of the association since 1997. Skansen describes itself as 'the world's oldest open-air museum, showcasing the whole of Sweden with houses, animals and traditions from every part of the country'. Carrying a bouquet of delicate white flowers, the Princess was snapped as she shook hands with Sanne Houby-Nielsen, along with Skansen director Maria Groop, Russel, director of operations Clara Block-Hane, and chairman Hans Malmsten. The Summery look complements her outfits from previous years where she has worn a similarly floral frock of varying colours. Last year, she looked perfectly chic in a matching floral white and grey blouse and skirt from the Scandinavian fashion brand, Malina. The royal opted for natural make-up and a simple, stylish low bun to complement her floral frock during her outing today The mother-of-three (pictured, left) is photographed while being greeted by Sanne Houby-Nielsen, director of the Nordic Museum (pictured, right) Her appearance today follows another recent outing. Last week, the Crown Princess attended World Wildlife Fund (WWF) event with her dog Rio. The organisation, which focuses its work on protecting the environment and nature, hosted in annual event in Stockholm. Dressed casually in a purple parka jacket and fitted green trousers, the royal rode the ferry where she visited the Nämdöskärgården National Park on the archipelago of Nämdö. Once slipping off her parka, the Princess revealed a magnificent queen silk blouse which was open necked. As a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme, Victoria has long been committed to causes including sustainability and climate action.

In attendance for the final on Saturday 11 May, she opened the ceremony with a pre-recorded speech to the hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide. The royal appeared to be following in the footsteps of the Princess of Wales, who opened the song contest in Liverpool last year with a touching piano performance tribute to Ukraine. Victoria looked chic in a pale pink suit, which she paired with a white blouse and stilettos in the short clip. She appeared to be standing in one of the main rooms in the Palace, revealing the opulent decorations and a large bouquet of flowers placed behind her.

        "description": "Portraying the separation of the capital-gains measures into a stand-alone bill as a shrewd political strategy to trap Conservatives distracts from the reality",
        "content": "The justifies the increased capital-gains inclusion rate (from one-half to two-thirds) on fairness grounds, asserting that only 0.13 per cent of Canadians with the highest incomes are expected to realize gains exceeding the $250,000 annual threshold. Even though it is now apparent the capital-gains tax increase will adversely affect many ordinary Canadians as well, in his recent Justin Trudeau has doubled down on this equity rationale, saying as he did in 2015 that the richest few should pay a little more. proposes the implementing legislation for many of the budget measures but conspicuously omits the contentious capital-gains provisions, for which important details still remain unknown as the effective date of June 25 approaches. Chrystia Freeland promises a separate bill on capital gains before the summer, which she says will force Conservatives to take a stand on tax fairness. This is disingenuous in two respects. Portraying the separation of the capital-gains measures into a stand-alone bill as a shrewd political strategy to trap Conservatives distracts from the reality: They were evidently a last-minute budget addition to raise revenue and contain this year’s deficit at the promised $40-billion cap. It’s clear that the technical amendments were not released with the budget because the Department of Finance was not given enough time to prepare them and they still are not ready. Moreover, the Liberals are framing support for the capital-gains tax increase as a choice exclusively about fairness, and in particular how progressive our income tax system should be. They argue that our already steeply progressive taxes – where higher rates apply to higher thresholds of income – should be torqued further, even though the already bear 22.5 per cent of all income taxes paid, and the . But this obsessive Liberal focus on their highly progressive version of tax equity obscures other important objectives of sound tax policy. These include ensuring Canada’s tax system is competitive with other countries, promotes capital investment and productivity improvements, and minimizes unwarranted complexity of compliance and administration. The capital-gains proposals arguably fail on all counts. In one respect, an increased capital-gains inclusion rate could possibly be justified on equity grounds not because it exacerbates progressivity so the richest Canadians pay more, but rather because it better measures a taxpayer’s ability to pay, regardless of income level. The base of our income tax to which progressively increasing tax rates apply is “income,” which is comprised of incomes from all sources plus, since 1972, one-half of gains from dispositions of capital properties. The in 1966 had recommended adoption of a comprehensive income base including 100 per cent of realized capital gains as a suitable measure of a taxpayer’s economic power, because “a buck is a buck is a buck,” but in conjunction with much-reduced marginal rates and more generous income averaging. In part to minimize the adverse impact on capital investment, and in part to avoid taxing nominal gains because of inflation, the government of the day instead adopted the arbitrary 50-per-cent inclusion rate for capital gains. Fiscal pressures led to this being increased to two-thirds in 1988, then to 75 per cent in 1990, and then returned to its present 50 per cent in 2000. There is thus no magic to any particular capital-gains inclusion rate. The policy goal is to appropriately estimate a taxpayer’s ability to pay without taxing inflationary gains or undermining incentives to invest in capital properties. The Carter Commission’s advice was to broaden the base (by increasing the capital-gains inclusion rate), and also to lower the rate of tax that applies to income as comprehensively determined. The Liberals are proposing only to broaden the base, but not to lower the overall rate, which for income over $247,000 is an excessively high 53.5 per cent for an Ontario-resident individual. This heightens the risks to capital investment that so many commentators have warned about. It is also arguably unnecessary because of the separate tightening of the alternative minimum tax base, which as of 2024 will now include 100 per cent of capital gains in any event. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is facing to take a position on the capital-gains issue. Canadians should reject the Liberal framing as a question solely of tax fairness, for unneeded enhancements to our already steeply progressive income tax system. The Liberals’ capital-gains proposal should be opposed on wider tax policy grounds, particularly its damaging impact on Canada’s already troubled investment climate. And whenever the draft legislation is eventually released, it is unlikely to reduce complexity of the tax system for ordinary Canadians.",

        "content": "Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes issued a joint statement (Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) The popular TV couple Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford's split is undoubtedly fresh, say close friends. Contrary to some circulating rumours which insist the pair have led entirely separate lives since 2022, they have in fact been fully supporting each other, before what's being called \"the past few months\". Both Eamonn and Ruth have faced significant personal hurdles over recent years including bereavement, workplace stress and health complications, navigating these issues whilst living together. Despite speculation, GB News anchor Eamonn, and Loose Women and QVC presenter Ruth, commenced the year sharing their Weybridge-based home in Surrey. Begging to differ with claims the couple separated as far back as two years or six months ago, one confidante noted: \"Their breakup has been very recent and only happened in the past few months. At the beginning of the year they were living together and working in the normal patterns, except for when Eamonn was off for reasons relating to his health,\" reports the Mirror .

It hasn't. They have been juggling things and getting by as they have for a very long time. Their marriage broke down very recently and while it is a sad time for them both, they are absolutely determined to keep things amicable.\" They were further criticised suggestions that Ruth is instigating the divorce. \"That's not the case but whatever has caused them to divorce is private,\" stated a friend, adding \"it's between them\". Express.co.uk has contacted Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford's representatives for comment. Eamonn and Ruth, both aged 64, have faced their fair share of turmoil in recent years including the GB News presenter's health struggles encompassing chronic back pain, a hefty tax bill predicament and the heartbreaking loss of his mother in 2022.

Read our Privacy Policy In October 2022 Eamonn's situation deteriorated significantly after a fall at home during his recovery from the earlier back surgery. The unplanned tumble resulted in a broken shoulder. The following year Eamonn publicly recounted how his wife had been with him during this distressing incident, which was triggered when his legs collapsed underneath him. He detailed: \"I was on a curve of the stairs, and I just went back down the stairs, boom, boom, boom down the whole staircase until I hit the stone floor in the hallway.\" Describing the painful aftermath, he said: \"Blood was pouring out my mouth, and a bone was sticking out my shoulder. Ruth came rushing down the stairs. She kept saying, 'You're fine, everything's okay, you're fine.' I said, 'Ruthie, there is a bone sticking out of my shoulder - I'm not fine'.\" Their ordeal did not stop there as they had to wait four hours for an ambulance to arrive once Ruth made that critical call. Recounting the agonising wait, Eamonn explained: \"Ruthie put a pillow under my head and sat with me in the hall and we tried to sleep.\" Eamonn and Ruth have been married for almost 14 years (Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) In spite of their trials, the resilient couple were seen enjoying their son Jack's 21st birthday celebrations the subsequent month in February. By the end of 2023, they were getting into the festive spirit despite Eamonn's persistent health concerns, something Ruth acknowledged they were learning to manage. \"Being a carer is not always easy, but when someone you love needs help, you step up,\" she shared with a magazine. Looking ahead to 2024, she expressed her hopes for Eamonn: \"For 2024, I obviously hope for Eamonn that his back improves, he's not in pain and can move around more.\" Ruth has faced her own challenges, including the tragic suicide of her sister Julia in 2019. She now cares for her elderly mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's and resides in a care home near Ruth's residence.

(Image: PA) She has also opened up about her struggle with empty nest syndrome following the departure of her son Jack, now 22, who resides in Manchester. Throughout these trials, she has been caring for Eamonn, who has struggled with mobility due to his bad back and a double hip replacement in 2016. \"Eamonn has been looked after and cared for by Ruth for a very long time,\" a friend revealed. \"How would she have been able to do that if they had not been together? It would be impossible. She has been there for him all this time, the split is a recent development not one that's been secretly going on for years.\" Eamonn expressed dissatisfaction with how he and his spouse were treated by ITV when Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond took over their spots on This Morning in 2020. Trending Regardless, both Eamonn and Ruth have continued to forge ahead with their careers. Eamonn helms GB News' breakfast show daily from 6am, while Ruth continues to grace Loose Women with her presence. Throughout their careers, they've shown unwavering support for each other's endeavours Eamonn has often voiced his pride for her thriving fashion business via QVC, which now enters its sixth year; Ruth, on the other hand, is known to chip in while he's on air with contributions made through messages.

        "description": "UTJ's Meir Porush says his wife, adult children were at the pilgrimage site to help him as he oversaw its closure to the general public in advance of Lag B'Omer holiday The post Minister arranged for family to join him in Meron despite strict closure appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage Minister Meir Porush arranged permits for himself and his family to visit Mount Meron in the Galilee on the eve of the Lag B’Omer holiday, despite orders closing the site to the public due to security concerns, according to a Monday report. The minister’s office told the Kan public broadcaster that Porush, who had responsibility over the security precautions that closed the site, was there in order to manage the closure, and that his family members only joined him to help. Porush, along with his wife, his daughter, and his two sons, reportedly spent all of Shabbat at the pilgrimage site, which usually draws as many as 100,000 worshipers, all but a handful of whom were barred from entering this year. His two sons — one of whom, Yisrael Porush, is the former mayor of Elad in central Israel — were reported to have received permits on the premise that they were the elder Porush’s drivers. “Minister Porush stayed in Meron for a few days before the holiday for management purposes, with the help of a team from his office,” the minister’s office responded in a statement. “His wife and his daughter helped him with his personal needs over the course of his stay,” the statement continued. “The minister’s sons served as his drivers through round-the-clock shifts, as they have done for years.” Neither Porush nor his sons were present at any private events, the statement added, saying that all of their activity there was for official purposes. Mount Meron is home to the tomb of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, who is celebrated on Lag B’Omer. The tomb compound normally attracts some 100,000 people for the holiday. Crowd sizes have been a major concern since 2021, when 45 people were killed in a crush as they traversed a slippery walkway during the annual pilgrimage. This year, authorities limited attendance at the compound to no more than 30 people at any given time, due to concerns that worshipers could not be safely sheltered in the event of a rocket attack by the Lebanese terror group Hezbollah. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Israelis attempted to visit the compound anyway over the course of the holiday, leading to violent clashes between pilgrims and police. On Monday, Hezbollah fired a barrage of at some 35 rockets toward Meron, some of which were intercepted and some of which landed in open areas, causing no reported injuries, but sparking at least one fire. The terror group declared that the rocket barrage toward Meron, as well as a later barrage of some 25 rockets launched toward the city of Kiryat Shmona, was in response to an Israeli strike that killed a terror operative outside a south Lebanon hospital earlier in the day. The Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Committee, which runs the hospital, said one person was killed and 10 were wounded in that strike, four of them seriously. Since October 8, Hezbollah-led forces have attacked Israeli communities and military posts along the Israel-Lebanon border on a near-daily basis, with the group saying it is doing so to support Gaza during the war there. So far, the skirmishes on the border have resulted in 10 civilian deaths on the Israeli side, as well as the deaths of 14 IDF soldiers and reservists. There have also been several attacks from Syria, without any injuries. Hezbollah has named 322 members who have been killed by Israel during the ongoing skirmishes, mostly in Lebanon but some also in Syria. In Lebanon, another 62 operatives from other terror groups, a Lebanese soldier, and dozens of civilians have been killed. Emanuel Fabian contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Back in 2021 when Jordan Love was signed by the Green Bay Packers, not many expected the QB to be as good as he is today. After spending the first two seasons in Aaron Rodgers’ shadow, Love had a coming of age last season with 32 TDs scored and 4,159 yards covered. His exploits last season have raised his stocks considerably in the NFL with many DEs being varied. However, there is a debutant DE this season who Jordan Love will be acquainted with. The DE is Ron Stone Jr., Jordan’s girlfriend’s brother. The 24-year-old Defensive End is entering the NFL on the back of a stellar campaign for Washington State . To put things into context, last season saw Ron record his career-best numbers of 60 tackles, 11 for a loss, and 5.0 sacks. These exploits have thus landed him in the NFL with the Las Vegas Raiders taking a punt on Ron. The WSU alum’s signing has been a matter of excitement for the Raiders fandom as he comes with an extensive experience of 5 years. Moreover, veteran ESPN analyst Mel Kiper also rated him as the 25th-best outside linebacker among active players in the collegiate circuit. Factor in his versatility in the defense line and Ron Stone becomes a rock-solid partner for the Raiders’ superstar DE Maxx Crosby. All said, the Raiders with Ron’s signing have certainly added an element of youthfulness and vigor to their backline. This particularly bodes well for Las Vegas when facing teams led by accomplished QBs, especially against the likes of Patrick Mahomes with whom there seems to be a rivalry brewing. Crosby’s Raiders Vs Jordan Love’s Packers, The Next Big Rivalry? For the last four decades, the Raiders vs Packers game has been one-way traffic favoring Green Bay . It was only last season that the Raiders broke their duck of losing eight straight games against the Packers with a 17-13 victory. Considering the constant humiliation that the Raiders face from the Packers, the rivalry will now get more spicy with Ron Stone Jr. in the mix. On the one hand, the Las Vegas Raiders will be fighting for their pride, while Jordan Love, on the other hand, will be fighting to not lose his domination. The Packers QB in particular would be hoping to not lose to his potential brother-in-law, adding more layers to this budding rivalry. Unfortunately for us, we can only dream of this match for the time being, as the Raiders won’t be taking on the Packers in the regular season this year. However, both teams have been heralded by many as the dark horses for the Super Bowl this time. Thus it would be a delight if the two teams were to lock horns in the playoffs this time raising the stakes even higher.",

        "content": "Janhvi Kapoor is currently awaiting the release of her next ‘Mr & Mrs Mahi’ which also stars Rajkummar Rao in the lead role. Janhvi Kapoor recently opened up about how doctors had advised her to not play cricket post the injury she had on the sets of her upcoming film. Janhvi underwent rigorous training and the intense cricket practice caused her to dislocate her shoulder twice. Talking to Bollywood Bubble, Janhvi revealed that the doctor had advised her to not play cricket. She stated that when she dislocated her shoulder for the first time, she thought it might be a fluke or she was overworked. But the second time around, when she had the second dislocation, nearly three months after the first, she consulted a shoulder specialist. She revealed that the specialist told her that she had multi-directional instability which meant that she was the worst candidate for cricket. The specialist even advised Janhvi that she shouldn’t be playing cricket all her life because she is very susceptible to dislocations. Janhvi recalled that despite the injuries she had to train, however, she had a strategy. Every time they had to train to play cricket, Jahvi taped up her shoulders to keep it in place. “I had a cap of about 60 balls but we ended up reaching 100 balls a day. I could not even play with a season ball so the team had even changed to a machine ball,” she recalled.",

On the contrary, Kelce defended Brady — admitting that he’d also do whatever he could do to gain a slim advantage during a game, while also trivializing just how much impact a slight deflation in footballs would have on a game. “I don’t even think Tom should have gotten in trouble for deflating footballs,” Kelce said. “I’m pro deflating footballs. I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I am pro deflating footballs. He outsmarted people. Why the (expletive) does it matter how much air is in that (expletive)? If you’re throwing it and catching it, who the (expletive) cares? ... “We’re all mad because he had the common sense to (expletive) take a little air out so the receivers could catch the (expletive) thing? “Why is that against the rules? Y’all could have taken the air out, too. You guys could have taken the air out, too. You just weren’t smart enough. So why am I getting penalized because you’re (expletive) dummies? It’s a rule, but it’s a stupid rule, though. ... You’re taking away intelligence.” Despite the year-long drama involving Brady, Roger Goodell, the NFL, and “Deflategate”, Brady earned the last laugh after getting hit with a four-game suspension before the 2016 season. Brady went on to win three more Super Bowls between the Patriots (LI, LIII) and Buccaneers (LV) after that suspension — with the former QB “Remember Deflategate? The NFL spent 20 million dollars and found that it was ‘more probable than not’ that I was ‘generally aware’ that someone may have deflated my footballs,” Brady said during the Netflix special. “You could’ve just given me the 20 million and I would’ve just told you I (expletive) did it.” Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during football season.

        "content": "can still have a wild night on the town despite his training routine. As seen on social media, at his bar, The Black Forge Inn in Dublin, Ireland. He returns to the cage on June 29 to take on Michael Chandler at UFC 303. As per MMA Junkie, the 35-year-old removed a celebratory Instagram post, but his Instagram Story had a link to a video that showcased footage from the bar on the platform. “Stocky tills at @theblackforgeinn,” McGregor wrote in the deleted post. “Quarter past 2 in the mornin ye hahahaaha.” In one video, McGregor and his fiancée, Dee Devlin, were shown driving up in a beautiful automobile to the bar and then entering via fireworks. In one clip, McGregor was seen holding behind the DJ booth, but in other reels, he was seen posing for pictures close to it. McGregor even happened to run into Lee Hammond, another Irish mixed martial artist. None of the images or videos depict Conor McGregor drinking; during his fight preparation, he had , as he stated on a Duelbits live broadcast. McGregor seems to be having fun completely naturally without the aid of alcohol. After spending almost three years out of the ring, McGregor will make his comeback at UFC 303. He last competed at UFC 264 in July 2021, when he was defeated by Dustin Poirier. McGregor (22-6) and his UFC 303 opponent, Chandler (23-8), will compete at welterweight. They previously trained against one other on The Ultimate Fighter season two. Chandler told The Post that he expects to end McGregor’s career. “I truly believe what I’m going to do to him on June 29 is going to warrant and merit him never stepping back into the octagon,” he said. Conor Mcgregor has been appearing in movies and generally out of the UFC fight world for a couple of years. His return is very much anticipated, but it will not be an easy fight. Overall, McGregor should enjoy himself while he can before locking in 100% for the fight. [ ]",

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. — Four teenagers were killed and another was seriously injured when their truck collided with a semitrailer in rural south-central Wisconsin early Monday. The Dodge County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that deputies responded to the crash just outside Columbus around 4 a.m. An initial investigation shows the teenagers were traveling north in a pickup truck when they ran a stop sign and hit an eastbound semitrailer. The pickup's driver, a 19-year-old Sun Prairie man, was pronounced dead at the scene. So were a 17-year-old male passenger from Sun Prairie and a 16-year-old male passenger from Madison. An 18-year-old female passenger from Madison died later at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison. Another 18-year-old female passenger from Madison was taken to the same hospital with life-threatening injuries. The semitrailer driver, a 57-year-old man from La Farge, was taken to a hospital in Columbus with minor injuries. The sheriff's office has not identified anyone involved in the crash, which remains under investigation. Columbus, a city of about 4,000 people, lies about 27 miles (45 kilometers) northeast of Madison, the state capital.",

        "content": "Many coming of age in the 1960s hold a special place in their hearts for Iron Butterfly’s 1968 psychedelic rock anthem “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.” Now, the vocalist, composer and organist behind the mega-hit — Doug Ingle — has died. He was 78. Ingle’s son, Doug Ingle Jr., confirmed his father’s death on social media . “It’s with a heavy heart & great sadness to announce the passing of my father Doug Ingle,” he wrote. “Dad passed away peacefully this evening in the presence of family.” “Thank you Dad for being a father, teacher and friend. Cherished loving memories I will carry the rest of my days moving forward in this journey of life. Love you Dad,” the post continued. Ingle was born in Nebraska and raised in San Diego, forming Iron Butterfly in 1966, according to The Guardian . The band released “Heavy” and then “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” in 1968, the title of the latter being a garbled version of “in the garden of Eden.” Ingle wrote the song while drinking a gallon of wine, the Guardian wrote — hence the garbled title. The original version of the song was 17 minutes before a radio version was slashed down to three. The shorter version of the song reached number 30 on the Billboard top 100 chart. Ingle and Iron Butterfly released two more albums after “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” but neither matched the commercial success of that album. The band was slated to play at the Woodstock festival in 1969, but they wound up getting stranded at New York’s LaGuardia Airport, according to Ultimate Classic Rock . Unfortunately, by 1974, three years after the band broke up, Ingle was in serious debt. “I was a child among men,” Ingle told the Los Angeles Times in the mid-’90s . “I was dealing with people who were competent but not necessarily (working) in my interest. I took the luxury of playing ostrich. I didn’t involve myself at the business level at all. I just went out and performed.” Ingle lost most of his property, including a 600-acre ranch and an apartment building in Woodland Hills, California. He even had to sell his grand piano, according to the Los Angeles Times. Ingle rejoined Iron Butterfly and toured with the band in 1978 and through most of the ‘80s and ‘90s, officially retiring in 1999, according to NBC News . “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida” would go on to influence a generation of rockers, and was famously covered by “ The Simpsons .” More music content",

        "content": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Four teenagers were killed and another was seriously injured when their truck collided with a semitrailer in rural south-central Wisconsin early Monday. The Dodge County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies responded to the crash just outside Columbus around 4 a.m. An initial investigation shows the teenagers were traveling north in a pickup truck when they ran a stop sign and hit an eastbound semitrailer. The pickup’s driver, a 19-year-old Sun Prairie man, was pronounced dead at the scene. So were a 17-year-old male passenger from Sun Prairie and a 16-year-old male passenger from Madison. An 18-year-old female passenger from Madison died later at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison. Another 18-year-old female passenger from Madison was taken to the same hospital with life-threatening injuries. The semitrailer driver, a 57-year-old man from La Farge, was taken to a hospital in Columbus with minor injuries. The sheriff’s office has not identified anyone involved in the crash, which remains under investigation. Columbus, a city of about 4,000 people, lies about 27 miles (45 kilometers) northeast of Madison, the state capital.",

        "description": "Gardening is a labor of love -- and requires a love of labor. The rewards are the colors and smells and bees ang butterflies, columnist Donna Vickroy says.",
        "content": "Tomato plants in. Flower beds redefined. Debris removed from hostas, lilies and coneflowers. Check. Check. Check. Tilling, pulling, digging, hauling. Gardening is work that never ends. And that’s exactly why I love it. I am a worker. I was raised to be busy. Growing up in a household of eight, if you weren’t doing something, well, you were lazy. Even though it’s been decades since the to-do list exceeded hours in the day, I still struggle with downtime. Coneflowers, seen here in columnist Donna Vickroy’s garden, are not only easy to grow and native to Illinois but they attract all sorts of pollinators. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) Life demands enough thankless work, chores that go uncelebrated but still need to be done. But there also is the work that reaps rewards. The snipping of dead blooms, the thinning of robust lily beds, the trimming of lilacs and spirea. If things go well, all of it will result in loveliness. Temporary loveliness, of course, but loveliness all the same. Peonies popping with brilliant color, tomatoes bursting with flavor, wisteria cascading with purple hues. Even when you fail and your clematis burns up in the sun, you gain knowledge and, thus, the opportunity to start again — in the shade. In 2020, when I decided to retire from full-time writing and people asked, “What will you do now?” I didn’t want to tell them, “Now that I’m grown up, I want to be a gardener.” But then COVID-19 hit and my dad took a turn and suddenly there was endless work and endless obstacles to getting that work done. Even though I didn’t need more to do at the age of 60, I opened the door on gardening, mainly because life was suddenly so stressful and I needed something that brought peace. I’d always been intrigued by gardening and would have dug into it sooner but there were kids to be raised and a career that demanded so much of my time. Back then, domestic duties were given minimal attention. Neglect is a nice euphemism. Foolishly, I thought, once I retired and had some time, I would instantly become a gardener. Ha. Donna Vickroy grew a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes in her garden last summer. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) Gardening takes planning, thoughtfulness, research. It takes strength, patience and humility. And it takes years of practice. It has literally taken me years to learn the identities of plants, let alone their properties. Thank goodness for that iPhone plant identifier. Countless times I have Googled, “Why won’t my peonies bloom?” “Where should I plant daisies?” “Should I deadhead black-eyed Susans?” I only recently learned about the importance of removing suckers from tomato plants and how to harvest basil properly. The journey has been a humbling one, fraught with failure, wasted funds and countless blisters, sunburns and thorn-like injuries. I now understand that I likely won’t live long enough to be really good at this. But that’s OK. I like that the endeavor is bigger than me. I like that the discipline requires ongoing investigation, not to mention trial and error. Mostly, I like that the endeavor is worthwhile. Not only does it reap a harvest of color, it enables me to give the earth something it appreciates. Years ago, while helping tend to my dad’s backyard veggie plot, he told me, “If you want the earth to work for you, you have to work for it.” In exploring the world of local fauna, I have discovered much about myself: How much I don’t mind dirt or worms or the occasional tortoise that crosses the border from the nearby wetlands; how much I like to collapse into the bed at night because I worked so hard all day; and, how much of a social media show-off I can be — did you catch the photo of my peonies? I was nervous that the supersonic cicada emergence would be more than I could handle, but so far I haven’t spied a single one in my yard. When we walk the dog, they’re all over the sidewalks of other neighborhoods but it seems ours has been spared. Bee balm flowers not only bring color and aroma to your garden, they live up to their name. (Donna Vickroy/Naperville Sun) And so my work continues. Hauling hoses, pulling buckthorn and sticker weeds, and trying desperately to keep the coleus happy. It is a never-ending job but it also is a labor of love. I love when the wild geranium loses control and has to be cut back. I love when the bee balm lives up to its name. I love when the cherry tomato harvest is so robust that I have to stand and eat them off the stalks to maintain order. And I love the creativity gardening affords. I put together a fairy garden for my grandchildren. I relegated a portion of my new perennial garden to milkweed. And, last year, I scattered wildflower seeds across the railroad garden, which backs up to a heavily traversed walkway. By mid-July, the trains were circling a small meadow. I love when the honeysuckle vines leap, their blooms becoming a siren for hummingbirds. And I especially love when finches, butterflies and bees come to feast and join the show. I will never be an expert. My home will never make the garden club circuit. And there will always be something that’s failing, struggling or completely out of place. But they are my gardens. And I am proud to be at their service.",

        "content": "Michael Thorbjornsen of Stanford finished No. 1 in the PGA Tour University standings and secured his PGA Tour card as soon as he turns professional. Thorbjornsen, a 22-year-old from Massachusetts, was one of the top players in college golf this season and has capitalized on the tour's relatively new pathway for amateurs to qualify for the tour directly through college. Thorbjornsen accrued a high enough points average over the past two years to finish the 2023-24 NCAA season atop the rankings. Points are awarded for playing college tournaments as well as getting into professional events. Thorbjornsen has made the cut in four professional tournaments already, most recently the 2023 John Deere Classic. He placed fourth at the 2022 Travelers Championship, where he was playing on an exemption. Thorbjornsen, whose four-year Stanford career concluded when he missed the 54-hole cut at the NCAA Championship, would be eligible for the remainder of the 2024 PGA Tour season and the entire 2025 season whenever he turns pro. \"PGA Tour U is, I think, one of the best programs in all of sports,\" Thorbjornsen said in a news release from the tour. \"What they've done, creating a pathway to the PGA Tour and to these different tours underneath it, it's huge. It gives students and us golfers reasons to stay for four years, and you can't really pass up on the opportunities that they present to you.\" The PGA Tour University pathway has been tweaked and modified, and last year was the first time a player who finished No. 1 in a given season received immediate access to the PGA Tour. That player was Ludvig Aberg, a Swede who parlayed his career at Texas Tech into a white-hot start to his pro career. He won one tournament apiece on the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour, played for the victorious Team Europe at the Ryder Cup, finished second to Scottie Scheffler at last month's Masters and is currently ranked No. 6 in the world. \"Ludvig, even though he's been on tour for say a year now, he's top 10 in the world, he's done unbelievable things recently,\" Thorbjornsen said. \"We're good friends, we competed a lot last year, so he's someone I look up to but I'm also trying to beat him as well.\" This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "The High Court quashed an order of Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj barring them from taking part in execution of various public works",
        "content": "The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Monday allowed contractors, who were delisted for being relatives of militants and separatists, “to participate in the tendering process” and quashed an order of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. “I find merit in these petitions...The impugned communication dated March 15, 2023, issued by the commissioner/secretary, Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, is quashed. The respondents shall permit the petitioners to participate in the tendering process,” Justice Sanjeev Kumar said. Justice Kumar was hearing a number of petitions where local contractors pleaded that they were denied permission to participate in a government tendering process for allegedly being related to militants or separatists. “Evidently, the competent authority has not proposed the cancellation or refusal to renew the certificates of registration issued in favour of the petitioners. Simply, because one or more relatives of the petitioners were involved in anti-national activities in early 1990s or thereafter cannot be a ground to deprive the petitioners of their right to enter into contracts with government for execution of various public works,” Justice Kumar held. The Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj in 2023 debarred a number of local contractors from participating in the process of government tendering on the basis of the communication received from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Jammu and Kashmir, wherein they “failed the security test”. The CID report suggested that “close relatives of the petitioners, i.e. brother, cousin, uncle, nephew, maternal uncle, father’s maternal uncle, father etc. had in the past remained involved in subversive activities. Some of the relatives indicated in the remarks column of the verification reports are dead for the last couple of decades. “I am of the considered opinion that the impugned communication not only violates the fundamental right of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, but it has also the effect of depriving the petitioners of their right to livelihood implicit in Article 21. The relevant extract of Article 19 i.e. 19(1)(g) and 19(6),” the court observed. Fundamental rights Justice Kumar further held that in a democracy, as we are, governed by rule of law and no authority, however high and mighty it may be, cannot be permitted to subvert the constitutional provisions. “The fundamental rights, which form the bedrock of rule of law, cannot be permitted to be tampered with in the manner it has been done by the commissioner/secretary, Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj,” the court observed. Referring to the 2010 rehabilitation policy for former militants in Kashmir who crossed into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Justice Kumar said, “To such a blatant violation of fundamental rights of the citizens, this court cannot remain a mute spectator. It may not be out of sync to point out that with a view to rehabilitating former militants/surrendered militants, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir has been promulgating rehabilitation policies.” The policy was intended to facilitate the return of former militants who belonged to the Jammu and Kashmir and had crossed over to PoK/Pakistan for training in insurgency but later gave up insurgent activities due to change of heart. “The intent and objective of the rehabilitation policies issued by the government from time to time was to bring the misguided youth and others, who had strayed into militancy but had realised their mistake, into the mainstream. The impugned communication issued by the then commissioner/secretary, Rural Development department and Panchayati Raj, is clear onslaught on the well thought after and wise decisions taken by the government to bring peace and normalcy in the then State of Jammu and Kashmir, now Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” the court observed. ‘Filmsy ground’ Justice Kumar said, “I have not been able to discern the thought process that might have gone into the mind of the then commissioner/secretary to issue such communication. They [contractors] were debarred from executing works of the Rural Development department on a flimsy ground that their uncle or even father’s uncle 10/20 years ago were involved in anti-national activities. As is evident from the CID report, most of the relatives of the petitioners named therein have either died or surrendered to make a new beginning as law- abiding citizens of this country.” The court held that it was a matter of “very serious nature”. “Let a copy of this judgment be placed before the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, for initiating departmental action against the concerned commissioner/secretary. A report with regard to action taken shall be submitted by the Chief Secretary to this court within a period of two months,” the court held. The court listed the case for July 29, 2024. Under the 2010 rehabilitation policy for militants, official figures suggest over 212 people returned from PoK through Nepal and other routes between 2010 and 2012, against 219 cases approved after security clearance.

        "content": "The National Federation of Visually Impaired Persons (NFOVIP) and volunteers from Vangani in Thane organised a special screening of the movie ‘Srikanth’ for visually impaired persons at a multiplex (SM5) in Kalyan on Sunday. ‘Srikanth’ is about a self-motivated blind student who sets out to achieve a near-impossible goal. The NFOVIP’s Thane branch has over 70 visually impaired and partially sighted men and women and provides a variety of services to assist similarly challenged students in education and all-round development. While blind students listened to the movie, the partially blind viewed it. For many of them, watching or listening to a movie in the theatre was a first-time experience. Completing the entertainment package were popcorn and cold beverages. Volunteers said the viewers and listeners left motivated, willing to learn new things to achieve their dreams. NFOVIP was established in 2010 to support visually impaired families in meeting their daily needs and achieving sustainable development. It runs a working hostel for partially/ fully visually impaired persons (VIP), with currently eight residents. There are plans to expand to accommodate over 25 persons. They receive food, accommodation and training in packaging materials, making incense sticks, and cooking. Several visually impaired families are keen to participate in self-sustainability projects. The organisation aspires to establish new initiatives such as a computer learning centre to enhance employment opportunities for visually challenged in banking and private sectors. Sambhaji Badar, 47, and his wife Mangla (both visually impaired), and their six-year-old son Yagnesh (a normal-sighted person) live in Vangani. Badar said, “I operate an incense stick business and sell it on trains, while my wife does massage work through home visits. She and I are happy that our son was born normal and is studying in a school in Vangani.” Babu Aher, 53, visually impaired and unmarried, lives in Vangani in a rented home. He was invited by NFOVIP to watch the movie. He said, “I was very happy to watch a film after 20 years. I belong to Nashik and my parents have passed away. In the village, where my brother and his family live, there is no scope. I moved to Mumbai where there are several opportunities. I sell pens and diaries on trains. Previously, I worked at Birla Ayurveda company where I earned Rs11,000 per month, but lost my job after the pandemic.”",

        "content": "NEW YORK — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. ''I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,\" Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers' series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. \"Now that I've been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn't affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.'' In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees' Aaron Judge and Houston's Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. ''It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,'' Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. \"It's getting better day by day. It's definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.'' Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn't run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. \"Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,'' he said. ''But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.'' ''Obviously, the legs — isn't that great, but I don't personally think it's affecting the swing,'' Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn't play the next day. ''I feel pretty good with the back. I've been working out and making sure that's in a good place,\" he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He's not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. ''A starting pitcher can tell you that there's a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,\" Ohtani said. ''So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I'm really just focused on just progressing every day.\" He hasn't concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn't pitching. ''It's hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,'' Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. ''Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,\" he said. ''I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there.\" ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",

According to Carlos, the media and fans tried to destroy Vinicius during his early days at Real Madrid, which has made the Brazil international even stronger. Speaking to the media at a recent event, Carlos said via TheMadridZone, that it would be natural for Vinicius to win the top individual prestigious award. “They tried to destroy Vini when he was young and that made him stronger,” the former defender said of Vinicius. “There are other great players, but we needed a player like Vini. If he continues like this, it will be natural for him to win the Ballon d’Or.” Vinicius has been impressive for Real Madrid this season. He has already helped Los Blancos win La Liga and has played a key role in taking them to the UEFA Champions League final where they will face Borussia Dortmund.

        "description": "The one-of-a-kind champion turned broadcaster never left the public eye but still nobody knew of his fight.",
        "content": "Two-time NBA champion Bill Walton, who dominated the hard court during a 13-year pro basketball career and later excelled as a broadcaster, has died after a “prolonged” battle with cancer. The 71-year-old was with his family when he died, NBA spokesperson Mark Broussard said in a statement. Walton led the Portland Trail Blazers to an NBA championship in 1977 and won a second NBA title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today And after a 13-year career on the hardwood, Walton moved into the media. “(He) translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colourful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said. Former ESPN commentator JA Adande said “‘I’m much better at getting high than getting low’ might be the ultimate Bill Walton quote”. “I never saw him ‘low’, no matter how much his chronically bad back might have been bothering him. I assume now he had cancer when I saw him in February. Couldn’t tell,” Walton was a high school phenom before he went to play for coach John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins. There, Walton won three consecutive National College Player of the Year awards between 1972 and 1974 and helped lead the Bruins to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973. Off the court, Walton became one of the most polarising athletes in the country with his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War, the Nixon administration and the FBI. He was even arrested at a war protest during his junior year. With a shock of flame red hair, Walton also broke the mould for what a college athlete should look like with his multicolored headbands and flannel shirts. He declared himself a vegetarian, practised meditation and became a lifelong fan of The Grateful Dead. “Your generation has screwed up the world,” he said in a statement after his arrest. “My generation is trying to straighten it out. Money doesn’t mean anything to me. It can’t buy happiness, and I just want to be happy.” Being happy to Walton meant to pursue an NBA career. Selected as the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton led the Trail Blazers to a championship three years later and also won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award. In 1978, Walton won the NBA’s Most Valuable Player Award. But from high school through the rest of his career, Walton was dogged by foot and leg injuries that forced him to play through the pain. He missed three seasons because of injuries that required some three dozen surgeries to correct. At age 34, Walton retired after playing just 10 games of the 1986-87 season. In his autobiography, Walton wrote that his biggest regret was playing hurt. “I didn’t let pain be my guide. I didn’t say, ‘If it hurt a lot, don’t play,” Walton wrote. But Walton was not done with basketball. A stutterer, Walton overcame his speech impediment to become one of the country’s best-known — and sometimes controversial — basketball commentators. Walton called games for NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, ESPN, Turner Sports and, most recently, provided commentary for ESPN broadcasts of Pac-12 basketball. In 2001, Walton received an Emmy for best live sports television broadcast. Along the way, Walton built a collection of outlandish quips, some of which were compiled online by an outfit called Awful Announcing. “Come on, that was no foul,” Walton once declared mid-game. “It may be a violation of all the basic rules of human decency, but it’s not a foul.” Walton once likened a player to a mosquito. “If you ever think you’re too small to make a difference, you’ve never spent a night in bed with a mosquito, or you’ve never played basketball against Taylor from Utah — No. 11 in your program, No. 1 in your heart,” he said. Walton could also go over the top with praise. For example: “John Stockton is one of the true marvels, not just of basketball, or in America, but in the history of Western civilisation!” Walton is survived by his second wife, Lori, and his sons from his first marriage: Adam, Luke, Nate and Chris, according to the NBA.",

        "content": "Jo Aleh and Molly Meech competing in Marseille last year. Photo: Getty Images By Dana Johannsen Yachting NZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections after one of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games, despite failing to meet the required performance standard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up in the 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined the announcement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Games last month. With five previous Games appearances and three Olympic medals between them, the pair are the most experienced of the nine-strong team named thus far. But according to Yachting NZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to be considered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10 placing at one of the designated selection regattas. The selection was signed off by the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamant proper process was followed in the nomination and selection of the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparent willingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech, along with a perceived inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes over its handling of selections and allegations of bias. Secret selection criteria leaked Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak of secrecy around how it selects its athletes for the Olympic Games. It is the only national body that does not publicly share its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC's nomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing to be considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep it confidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of the selection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clear an even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\" criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primary selection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominate athletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To be eligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline, achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta, or have medalled at a world championships during that Olympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailors or crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emerging talent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors need to finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selection regattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailing partner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly, won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver in Rio. Meech was also a silver medallist in Rio, alongside teammate Alex Maloney in the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separate ways following a disappointing 12th place finish in Tokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginning of 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite their credentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results on the international circuit. In the first of two selection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at the European Championships in Portugal last year - well outside the top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the World Championships earlier this year. Prior to being named in the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just one top 10 result at a major international regatta in two-and-a-half seasons - a sixth placing at the 2023 world championships. It is understood selectors relied heavily on this result, despite it not being an official selection regatta. Under the criteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew's track record of success at past Olympic Games\". However, those familiar with the policy say these factors only come into play in final deliberations once sailors have met the underlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken with several past and present members of the NZL sailing team, who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of this year's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fear of being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made a point of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFX pair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme of the conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceived inconsistent approach to its selections has created distrust in the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into the debate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, but told RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection, having had close friends impacted by selection policies in the past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happy to be selected and for us it was just a little step on the way to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus is very much on making sure we are doing everything we can over the next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named in the Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough result last month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming the bronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning to perfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone's reading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied an extraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meech in the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ, Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisation does not publicly comment on individual nominations, but all sailors and crews were selected in line with its policies. The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process led by an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertise and experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicol also asserted proper process was followed. \"All selections are made by an experienced selection panel. Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by [national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOC selectors against the agreed nomination criteria and the NZOC selection policy,\" she said in a statement. Selection discretion: Pedigree vs potential The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meech appears not to have been as readily available to others. RNZ understands at least one sailor - kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appeal with the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the new Olympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympic pole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke out about the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy, arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to the Olympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will be heard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in the meantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when a case is before the tribunal, but it is understood Walton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emerging talent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected under this criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women's IQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to be confirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesday morning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall at her two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16 nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky start to her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in the first two selection events earlier this year, before pulling it out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month. There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14th nation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focus on the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th at his three selection regattas. His 17th placing at the European Championships last year put him inside the top 16 nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28 year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. He finished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninth nation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships (15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event, Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next, I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let's see.\" 'Rigid' with rules 'when it suits them' One former international sailor said the governing body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\" approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, but also funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\" development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules to the absolute letter when it suits them. We're always being told, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when they want to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all this grey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directly address questions related to whether he has concerns about perceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. But in a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are \"transparent and available to every athlete throughout their campaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of the organisation also said the current policy was \"developed after an athlete-led review following the Tokyo Olympic Games\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refining the policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignored questions about whether the NZOC had any concerns about Yachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we are not able to comment on individual cases, we do understand how tough it is for athletes that may not have been nominated by their sport for selection to an NZ Team.\" It is not the first time questions have been raised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections for pinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) and Natalia Kosinska (RS:X) took cases to the Sports Tribunal over their non-nomination for the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruled in favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitration body Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport's handling of selections. \"I have concerns about the inadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. While the selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretion to YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide by the rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness in its implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in his decision.",

        "content": "Image credit: (Photo by Jay Biggerstaff/Getty Images) Here’s a take: College baseball’s selection committee largely got it right this year. I just last night argued it made a mistake in choosing East Carolina as a host over Dallas Baptist and I still believe that. But taken in totality, the committee did a good job. Eleven bids for the SEC? The right decision. Leaving Charleston and Northeastern out, making the Coastal Athletic Association a one-bid league? The right decision. Indiana and Georgia Tech in? The right decision. Cal and Lamar out? The right decision. I would have taken TCU instead of Kansas State. Oklahoma State should be seeded higher than Oklahoma, a team the Cowboys went 4-1 against. But reasonable people can disagree about all of this. The problem, however, is that the selection committee is taking a ton of heat right now because of a perception problem. The committee is composed of sitting college baseball administrators — this year it’s 10 athletic directors — and, unluckily, this year a lot of those committee members had teams that fell on the bubble of something — the top-eight seeds, hosting or the tournament field. And just about every decision that involved one of those schools went in a favorable direction for those teams. The NCAA sets rules and procedures that all of its selection committees have to follow in such cases. If a committee member’s school is ever up for discussion, that person must leave the room and they are not a part of any voting in the debate. But what does that look like in practice? We don’t know. We don’t know a lot about the selection process and that’s a problem, even if it’s only a problem of perception and that, in fact, the procedures put in place to safeguard the system are working perfectly. The process is inherently subjective. This is not professional sports, where teams are playing uniform, consistent schedules, meaning that it’s entirely reasonable to build a playoff field out of division winners and then a few more teams that had the best records. And when the selection committee leans too heavily on RPI – one of the most objective tools it has at its disposal (it might be flawed, but it’s literally just an algorithm that doesn’t care what conference you represent or how big your stadium is) – people get mad. When the selection committee deviates from RPI, people also get mad. What this process needs more than anything is more transparency. Good luck even finding who is on the committee in any given year. The NCAA website is a nightmare to navigate and a lot of information is truly buried. Last month, a major conference head coach reached out to me to ask who was on the baseball committee. I’m always happy when coaches come to me for information, but in this case, that’s not a good sign. College baseball is becoming too big of a deal for its current process. The basketball selection committee releases its full seed list, 1-68. Baseball won’t even tell us what team is No. 17 or No. 65. Every selection committee I’ve ever talked to says the regional advisory committees (which are supposed to be their version of the eye test) are an important part of the process. I’d love to know how the RAC lined up the Big 12 teams. Is that why Kansas State was selected instead of TCU (which had better metrics) or Cincinnati or Kansas (which both had better conference records)? Show me the goods. College football and basketball both have in-season releases of the committee rankings (football does a Top 25 weekly down the stretch, while basketball shows a release of the top four seeds in each region once). Those are both mostly just content made for the TV partners. But they do at least give some early insight into the committees’ thinking. Committee chairman Matt Hogue on Monday was asked if baseball had explored something similar. He said they hadn’t to this point, but believed it would help drive interest to baseball. There are a number of ways the baseball committee could provide more clarity to the process. Instead, it remains largely a black box and that allows conspiracy theories to run rampant. Some, like the importance of having a team or league representative on the selection committee, have at least some correlating evidence, even if causality is impossible to prove. Others, like agendas for or against the SEC or Pac-12, appear to be essentially baseless. But they’re out there and they’re eroding confidence in the selection committee. Maybe it’s unreasonable to think these are solvable problems. Again, this is an inherently subjective process that gets harder every year because of conference consolidation and the increasing attention and money in the sport. Missing the tournament is more likely to have consequences for programs and coaches today than it did even 10 years ago, let alone 25 years ago. But bringing some sunshine into the committee room couldn’t hurt.",

        "description": "After a year where multiple natural disasters hit HRM, city staff is now working on enhancing its emergency management program after receiving an assessment report.",
        "content": "Findings of a report determining the state of HRM’s emergency management program was presented to Halifax’s Executive Standing Committee on Monday. The Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) framework was used to make the assessment, hoping to build the best possible emergency management program. “We have a lot of experience responding to emergencies,” said HRM Community Safety Executive Director Bill Moore. “We have a lot of very, very good staff doing a lot of really, really good work. This is not a reflection of that. This is about building the program around it.” HRM CAO Cathie O’Toole told the executive standing committee that assessing the maturity of emergency management for the city was her priority when she entered her role. The report shows the HRM’s emergency management program lacks documentation and structure and needs a multi-year strategic plan. Story continues below advertisement “Right now, we are strong in terms of the fact that we have good people and we are well practiced in terms of responding to emergencies,” said O’Toole. “The resilience piece, though, is of particular concern because without the documentation and without the training, then we may not be resilient if we lost two or three key individuals.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. The report came as a bit of a surprise to some councillors who believed the program was in good order, who now welcome the changes.

Paul Russell. “I’m also pleased to hear that...we’re moving ahead with that.” The internationally recognized EMAP set of standards used to assess and continuously improve emergency management programs will allow for plans to be updated regularly while providing a roadmap for building the program in the future.

Having managed the way through at least four emergency events last year, approval from the Executive Standing Committee for the report recommendations allows City Staff to begin strategic planning.

        "content": "Two days after the Rajkot blaze, forensic experts have been able to establish identities from DNA samples of only 13 of the 27 completely charred bodies recovered from the site of the TRP Game Zone fire. Of the 13 identified, seven bodies have been handed over to the victims’ families, Rajkot Collector Prabhav Joshi told The Indian Express . “Those remaining will be handed over in the morning as requested by the families. These have been kept in the cold room facility at the Rajkot Civil hospital and AIIMS,” Joshi said. The seven victims whose bodies have been handed over to the families are Satyapalsinh Chhatrapalsinh Jadeja (17), Smit Manishbhai Vala, Sunilbhai Hasmukhbhai Siddhpura (45), Jignesh Kalubhai Gadhavi, Omdevsinh Gajendrasinh Gohil (35), Vishvarajsinh Jasubha Jadeja (23) and Ashaben Chandubhai Kathad (38). Advertisement DNA sampling was necessitated after the bodies were charred beyond recognition. However, according to sources, the bodies were charred to such an extent that there was no fluid remaining for even easy DNA sampling. Some of the bodies were dismembered, too, they added. “Blood is required for extracting DNA samples from a dead body, but in the Rajkot incident, there was no blood (left in the bodies). So, the bones of the deceased were sent immediately to Gandhinagar FSL by an air ambulance to save time,” stated Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi, who visited the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar on Monday to review the investigation. Also Read | No fire clearance: Rajkot game zone kept flying under radar for 3 years He added that a team of more than 18 members “is working day and night to get the bodies of the deceased to their families as soon as possible”. The blaze that broke out on May 25 had claimed 28 lives, including seven minors. So far, the remains of all but one missing person have been found. Advertisement “Some of the DNA samples have been identified today (Monday). The process of DNA analysis is underway and it is expected to confirm the remaining samples as early as possible, likely by tonight,” a senior official confirmed to The Indian Express. According to Sanghavi, the FSL started working from 5 am Sunday. The first DNA samples to arrive were blood and post-mortem samples. “This operation has to be done in eight stages — from extracting the DNA samples to the final report. At each stage, the duration of the test is determined based on the type of the sample,” he said. Some of the hard tissue samples are estimated to take around 36-48 hours to be identified. Advertisement In the first stage that takes around six to seven hours, the case opening process is carried out for analysis of samples for testing, the minister explained. The second step, which also takes nearly six to seven hours, involves extracting DNA from the samples. The third step is to check the quantity and quality of the DNA. This takes around three to four hours, the minister said. “Then PCR (Polmerase Chain Reaction) of the DNA samples, i.e., DNA enrichment process is carried out under the fourth step. It is a three-four-hour process. The fifth stage involves DNA profiling, which takes approximately eight to nine hours. The DNA profile obtained under the sixth phase is analyzed, which takes two to three hours. In addition, the interpretation of the analyzed samples is done in the seventh phase that takes around six to seven hours, and the DNA report is prepared under the final and eighth phase that takes nearly three to five hours,” Sanghavi explained. On Sunday, Rajkot Collector Prabhav Joshi had said, “Despite some identification evidence on the bodies, like rings and bangles, the government decided on DNA analysis for scientific identification so that there is no mistake in handing over the bodies.”",

The minister stated this during the ongoing one year of the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, sectoral update on Agriculture and Food Security, held at the National Press Centre, Abuja on Monday. He said the government also procured and distributed to all states and FCT 58,500 metric tonnes of milled rice, to dampen escalating prices, fortified crops with Vitamin A micro-nutrient to enrich nutrition content and health value of food commodities. Listing some of the achievement, Kyari said, the government has procured and distributed 14,056,467 doses of anthrax spore, foot and mouth diseases vaccines for risk-based vaccination exercise in 22 high-risk states located in the NC, NW, NE, SW and SS zones of the country.",

        "content": "As the Trudeau government desperately seeks to improve its polling numbers heading into an election next year, Canadians are increasingly confronted with the reality that many of its signature policies don’t make sense. Not only that but, even worse, they often work against each other. A case in point is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s simultaneous goals of significantly increasing Canada’s annual immigration levels, creating more affordable housing and lowering Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by 2020. The problem is that higher immigration lowers the availability and raises the cost of housing, as well as increasing greenhouse gases. When the Trudeau government came to power in 2015, 271,845 immigrants became permanent residents of Canada. Its current plan boosts that number to 465,000 this year, 485,000 in 2024, 500,000 in 2025 and “stabilizes” it at 500,000 in 2026. In 2022, while the Trudeau government was developing its plans, its own public service warned it that this would exacerbate Canada’s housing shortage, raise prices and adversely affect other government services. As the Canadian Press reported earlier this year, documents obtained through an access-to-information request revealed that in 2022, public servants in the immigration ministry warned the government that, “In Canada, population growth has exceeded the growth in available housing units ... As the federal authority charged with managing immigration ... policy-makers must understand the misalignment between population growth and housing supply, and how permanent and temporary immigration shapes population growth ... “Rapid increases put pressure on health care and affordable housing.” Then there’s the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Herbert Grubel, a former federal MP and emeritus professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and Patrick Grady, a former senior official in the federal finance department, estimated in a 2021 Financial Post article that based on higher immigration levels, “greenhouse gas emissions will be 7.5% above what they would have been otherwise” in 2030 and “this gap will be much larger by 2050, the year the government has promised to reduce emissions to net-zero as required by the Paris accord.” As Canadians for a Sustainable Society notes on its website, “there is a direct link between immigration and sustainability.” One would think this would be obvious to everyone, including the Trudeau Liberals. Apparently not.",

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Joe Ryan pitched seven smooth innings for the Minnesota Twins, who got a two-run homer by Jose Miranda and a three-run shot from Trevor Larnach and hung on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff’s two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe’s two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach’s blast. The Royals have their first losing streak since a two-game skid from May 4-5 and just their second since April 30. Their eight-game winning streak was stopped on Sunday in Tampa Bay. TRAINER’S ROOM Royals CF Kyle Isbel was cleared for action after a full pregame workout but remained on the bench as a precaution, two days after fouling a ball off his face that caused a small fracture in his upper nose. The Royals have been remarkably healthy so far this season, but 2B Michael Massey just landed on the injured list with a lower back sprain. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. UP NEXT Royals: LHP Cole Ragans (4-3, 3.34 ERA) takes the mound on Tuesday night with a 13-inning scoreless streak over his last two starts with 19 strikeouts and just three hits allowed. Twins: RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (1-0, 2.57 ERA) pitches the second game of the series. In two starts at home this season, he has allowed only two runs over 11 innings with 14 strikeouts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "Australia is providing a $2.5 million aid package as Papua New Guinea (PNG) faces the aftermath of a massive landslide that buried over 2,000 villagers in Enga Province. A catastrophic landslide in a remote region of PNG has resulted in and posed substantial challenges for rescue and recovery efforts. The international community, including Australia and the United Nations, is stepping in to offer assistance. \"As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support,\" said Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. The treacherous terrain and ongoing geological instability, including falling rocks and cracking soil, are severely hampering rescue efforts. Australia's aid will include technical experts, incident management assistance, geo-hazard assessments, and early recovery support, with the Australian Defence Force involved. Australia may consider additional support beyond the initial aid package as the situation develops. Rescue operations will continue in the challenging conditions, with hopes of finding more survivors diminishing as time passes. Share 1 min read",

        "content": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Joe Ryan pitched seven smooth innings for the Minnesota Twins, who got a two-run homer by Jose Miranda and a three-run shot from Trevor Larnach and hung on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff’s two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe’s two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach’s blast. The Royals have their first losing streak since a two-game skid from May 4-5 and just their second since April 30. Their eight-game winning streak was stopped . TRAINER’S ROOM Royals CF Kyle Isbel was cleared for action after a full pregame workout but remained on the bench as a precaution, two days after fouling a ball off his face that caused a small fracture in his upper nose. The Royals have been remarkably healthy so far this season, but 2B Michael Massey just landed on the injured list with a lower back sprain. UP NEXT Royals: LHP Cole Ragans (4-3, 3.34 ERA) takes the mound on Tuesday night with a 13-inning scoreless streak over his last two starts with 19 strikeouts and just three hits allowed. Twins: RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (1-0, 2.57 ERA) pitches the second game of the series. In two starts at home this season, he has allowed only two runs over 11 innings with 14 strikeouts. ___ AP MLB:",

Adopted by all UN member nations, the SDGs offer a frame for an ambitious plan to transform our world for the better. Engaging young adults in meaningful discussions can lead to transformative learning — and action is key to meeting local and global targets. Universities across Canada and the world are working towards making institutional commitments towards sustainability and engaging students in this also. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization launched a Reflect-Share-Act framework in 2020 to assist anyone in acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to promote sustainable development in their community. Over the past two years, I participated in a sustainability fellowship program at the University of Saskatchewan. As part of this, I redesigned a marketing class using the UNESCO framework to include sustainability learning outcomes, activities and assessments. I used a survey at the start and end of each term to measure changes in student perceptions around sustainability and students’ own belief in their ability to enact change. The results showed consistent increases in terms of knowledge about what sustainability is and student optimism around how to make change happen. Many aspects of sustainability When most people think about sustainability, their first thought is usually about the environment or climate change. However, the UN global goals also address other aspects of sustainability, including: -elimination of poverty (SDG 1); -responsible consumption and production (SDG 12); -gender equality (SDG 5); -and quality education (SDG 4). I focused my efforts on an introductory marketing class that I’d taught several times. I introduced sustainable development and the SDGs at the start of the term with the promise of making specific connections to marketing concepts throughout the class. Students’ ideas for sustainable behaviours The focus of marketing often involves persuasion and considering how to drive sales/purchases. When talking about consumer behaviour and revisiting traditional marketing concepts, I shared examples of overconsumption (for example, purchasing water bottles in every new colour that comes out) and asked students to consider how they might reduce their own consumption. I pointed students towards a UN resource, The Lazy Person’s Guide to Saving the World for initial ideas — and then asked students to brainstorm actions they could take as marketers to contribute to SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production and other SDGs in their future workplaces. Students shared ideas such as evaluating the materials used in packaging and finding new ways to connect with customers to reduce sales-related travel and their own carbon footprint. Students were able to think about the impacts of their decisions and identify tangible ways to contribute to sustainable development. Next year I’m going to take the activity a step further by turning their ideas into an open resource for marketers wanting to prioritize sustainability. Here are some lessons learned from engaging business students in reflecting, sharing and acting on sustainability. Lesson #1: Lower your defences I’ve never been good at showing vulnerability. Dominant academic culture is based on having a strong defence and not showing weakness. I’ve found, however, that sharing my uncertainties in the face of global challenges has led to more conversation and connection with students. When I talk about worrying about how the world is running out of water, and discuss political and humanitarian issues around water security, I’ve found that students make great efforts to address these by finding solutions that exist now and might be invented in the future. It’s OK not to have all the answers and see what happens. Lesson #2: Authenticity is king (or queen) Students can be very perceptive. I’ve learned from feedback in course evaluations and informal chats that students pay attention to what I model, and the importance of being authentic. From my choice of clothing to the water bottle I bring to the classroom, these decisions matter to students. I have open conversations where I talk about an issue, such as the horrific environmental impacts of fast fashion in Ghana, as narrated in Aja Barber’s book, Consumed: The Need for Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change and Consumerism. Then I talk about my consumption choices in light of this issue. It helps students to see the connections between these issues and the everyday (better) choices we can all make. Lesson #3: Don’t take it personally I’ve found that some students are cynical about setting sustainability goals. It’s not that surprising — after all, I teach in a business school, and there is long-standing discussion about capitalist-forward business schools focussed on maximizing profits at the expense of everything else. Others are even suspicious of the United Nations. Some refuse to take any responsibility for sustainable development and put it on corporations to solve the world’s problems. It’s important not to take criticism personally. I’ve found that going deeper and examining these opinions can lead to interesting discussions. With regards to cynicism about the SDGs, I usually respond with questions such as: “What makes you think that? What have you read that leads you to those conclusions?” I’ve learned educators need to listen and learn non-judgmentally about how young people feel. They have valid reasons to react strongly about generations of business leaders who have recklessly pursued wealth with complete disregard for the impacts. Lesson #4: It’s not just about ‘what’ but about ‘how’ I’ve realized that how I engage with students on important global topics like sustainability is just as important as the content I share. UNESCO has said sustainability education should emphasize experiential, inquiry-based, problem-solving, interdisciplinary systems approaches and critical thinking. Approaches need to enable student action and not leave them feeling like the world’s issues are too large for them to tackle. Using this definition along with the Reflect-Share-Act framework, I was able to help students move beyond considering large, often daunting global issues to a place where they can take tangible actions and affect change. ___ Brooke Klassen does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. ___ This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

        "content": "An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government's proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada's non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada's conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government's draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government's draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 per cent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) blasted an that killed at least 45 people over the weekend as “an indefensible atrocity,” as criticism rises of the Israeli military operation in the southern Gaza city. The Israeli strike on the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood of Rafah targeted a humanitarian zone filled with tents, where Israel’s military previously instructed displaced Palestinians to shelter from the ongoing war against militant group Hamas, the Gaza Health Ministry said. The Israeli military claimed the strike killed two senior Hamas leaders. “The IDF’s attack on a tent camp of innocents in Rafah is an indefensible atrocity,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote . “This was done in open defiance of President Biden’s red line and the ICJ’s call for a ceasefire.” She added that it is “long past due” for Biden to “live up to his word” and stop military aid shipments to Israel, following through on a in an attempt to prevent Israeli attacks on Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a and called for an investigation into the civilian deaths Monday. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion, because this is our policy.” The attack comes just days after the International Court of Justice its operations in Rafah, the last remaining major settlement in Gaza that has not been invaded by the Israeli military. The strike was widely denounced, as criticism rises on the Israeli military operation in Rafah. A White House National Security Council spokesperson that the attack was “heartbreaking.” “Israel has a right to go after Hamas... but as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians,” the spokesperson said. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened.” French President Emmanuel Macron used the strike as an opportunity to again call for a cease-fire in the conflict. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” Macron wrote in a post on X. “I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire.” The Israeli military has , despite strong warnings from the Biden administration. More than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people are believed to be sheltering in Rafah, and more than 80 percent of the territory’s population overall are displaced from their homes. The U.N. said famine has begun in parts of the region as civilians struggle to get access to humanitarian aid.",

(WFLA) — A field of American flags was planted on top of graves at the Bay Pines National Cemetery on Memorial Day. “It is with eternal gratitude that we remember those who have paid the ultimate price of death to preserve our freedom and service to our nation,” retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen Marianne Matthewson-Chapman said. Among the attendees, was Evelyn Brady, a 20-year Navy veteran. “Today is Memorial Day for a lot of people,” Brady said. “For a lot of our gold star families, every day is Memorial Day.” Brady’s son, airman Mohammed Haitham, paid the ultimate sacrifice on Dec. 6, 2019, 10 days before his 20th birthday. Haitham and two others were killed during the Naval Air Station Pensacola shooting. “He ran into danger, he ran into the building where an active shooter was and tried to neutralize the situation and unfortunately, he was killed,” Brady said. While speakers touched on how many of those lost, they also shared one thing in common: patriotism. “So, today and every day, I honor my son,” Brady said.",

She then took a swipe at a race narrative — her own star player in A'ja Wilson said that race was a \"huge thing\" in Clark's popularity.

(AP Photo/John Loche, Filer) \"Even the Black and White thing — knock it off. It's not there. It's not there. So shut down the noise, and Black and White, what is she, 22? She's a 22-year-old woman with a lot of pressure. She's not perfect. She's a rookie in this league. Back off,\" Hammon said. Many took that as a swipe at Wilson, who had actually been standing right next to Hammon during that plea. Hammon was asked about those comments, with a reporter saying it had been \"miscontrued a couple times.\" \"It's construed as some of our minority Black and brown women are hating on her because she's white, and that is not the case. Let's take Caitlin out of the picture. What I think is upsetting... It's not about Caitlin. Give her her flowers. She's done stuff that no man or woman, Black or White, has ever done in college basketball. Give that woman her flowers,\" Hammon said . \"But what it does is, it has highlighted how Black and brown greatness has not been celebrated or valued as much. That's what I was talking about.\" Those recent comments did seem to echo what Wilson said earlier this month. Becky Hammon is recognized as part of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2023 during a break in play between the LSU Lady Tigers and the Iowa Hawkeyes during the 2023 NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament National Championship at American Airlines Center on April 2, 2023 in Dallas, Texas.

It doesn’t matter what we all do as Black women, we’re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That’s why it boils my blood when people say it’s not about race because it is.\" Ahead of her game Friday, Clark was asked about the \"narratives around the attention\" she's gotten \"versus some of the vets that have been in this league for a long time.\" \"To be honest, I'm not really on social media. I don't read that,\" Clark said. \"This is my job. My job is to compete and play basketball every single day. I think the more attention we can get on every team around this league, that's only going to help me get better and better. \"My job is just to continue to show up and help this team get better. We're fighting for our first win. That's my main focus.\" Head coach Becky Hammon of the Las Vegas Aces celebrates with family after defeating the New York Liberty during Game Four of the 2023 WNBA Finals at Barclays Center on October 18, 2023 in New York City.

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail T﻿he federal government's stance on law and order is under renewed pressure today as new figures show nearly a fifth of immigration detainees released by the High Court have reoffended. From the 153 former immigration detainees released off the back of the landmark High Court ruling last November at least 28 of them have been charged with offences under state laws, reports The Sydney Morning Herald . Among them was a former detainee allegedly involved in a violent Perth home invasion. READ MORE: As many as 2000 people feared buried under Papua New Guinea landslide﻿ A landmark High Court ruling last November led to the release of 153 former immigration detainees. (9News) The March figures were recently shown by the Department of Home Affairs to the Senate. They are expected to put pressure on the Albanese government to use new laws to lock up those released detainees who are deemed a high risk of reoffending, something they haven't done to date. The Coalition says this is an oversight, and has described the current situation as a \"detainee crime spree\"﻿. It wants the government to start using the new legislation enabling authorities to detain ﻿people again if they are at a high risk of reoffending, even if they haven't committed a crime. It is not known how many of the 28 have been under electronic surveillance, but government figures released earlier this month said only 76 of the 153 former detainees were wearing ankle monitoring devices as part of their visa conditions.",

        "content": "MINNEAPOLIS — Joe Ryan pitched seven smooth innings for the Minnesota Twins, who got a two-run homer by Jose Miranda and a three-run shot from Trevor Larnach and hung on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff's two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe's two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach's blast. The Royals have their first losing streak since a two-game skid from May 4-5 and just their second since April 30. Their eight-game winning streak was stopped on Sunday in Tampa Bay. TRAINER'S ROOM Royals CF Kyle Isbel was cleared for action after a full pregame workout but remained on the bench as a precaution, two days after fouling a ball off his face that caused a small fracture in his upper nose. The Royals have been remarkably healthy so far this season, but 2B Michael Massey just landed on the injured list with a lower back sprain. UP NEXT Royals: LHP Cole Ragans (4-3, 3.34 ERA) takes the mound on Tuesday night with a 13-inning scoreless streak over his last two starts with 19 strikeouts and just three hits allowed. Twins: RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (1-0, 2.57 ERA) pitches the second game of the series. In two starts at home this season, he has allowed only two runs over 11 innings with 14 strikeouts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "Between recorded renditions of “Ragged Old Flag” by Johnny Cash and “God Bless America” by Kate Smith, West Mifflin musician Brian Loosz sang a song that touched home with his audience in Bovard — a tribute to five men from the community who were killed in action in World War II. Loosz debuted his original song “Keep the Five Alive,” in 2010, when the Hempfield village marked its centennial. He’s returned with his guitar every year to perform it for the Memorial Day ceremony at the Bovard fire station pavilion. “My father was a Vietnam veteran, so I’ve always had a reverence for our military,” said Loosz. The five local men who perished in battle eight decades ago are memorialized with a display of their photos in the fire station’s social hall: • Marine Corporal Walter Burak, killed Oct. 9, 1942, during a battle on Guadalcanal that came to be called “Bloody Ridge; • Army Pvt. Robert E. Price Jr., who died in New Guinea on Dec. 18, 1942. He was awarded the Purple Heart after being shot in the stomach; • Army Pvt. Kasmir Dziedzickie, killed during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944; • Army Pfc. Mario Prisani, killed in the Battle of Brest in 1944; • Army Pfc. John I. Thomas, killed during fighting along the Burma Road in 1944. Some also have Bolivar streets renamed in their honor. Loosz, whose day job for 21 years was working in information technology for the Diocese of Greensburg, learned about Bovard and its World War II losses from a co-worker whose family is a mainstay of the fire department. “I wanted to write the town a song about the five,” he said, explaining he got inspiration from details about the men’s background and wartime correspondence that were included in a TribLive article . “I pieced things together, about the soldier’s boots that were wearing off, the dampness and malaria, and that the one guy was going to be a football star,” Loosz said. “I didn’t want to tip anybody off that I was doing it. It was going to be a surprise at Memorial Day that year.” At subsequent Bovard observances, he has paired the song with another he wrote, “Thank You,” addressed to Vietnam veterans like his father. “It came from them not getting the thanks they deserved,” he said. In ‘Keep the Five Alive,” Loosz sings, “Losin’ five sons is a big hit to a small town, so we’re gonna keep the five alive.” There’s an added urgency in preserving the memory of the sacrifices World War II soldiers from Bovard and other communities made since that generation’s presence is steadily fading. According to the National Park Service, about 1.25 million Pennsylvanians served in the armed forces in World War II. Less than 10,000 were still alive in 2022. “Please remember all those who have gone before us,” said Frank Saunders, a Bovard native, former firefighter and Army veteran of the Vietnam era who served as master of ceremonies for Monday’s program. Saunders read a roll call of six local veterans of various eras who have died since last year’s Memorial Day ceremony: Air Force veteran Wayne Lentz, 85; Army veteran John Yagla, 90; Army National Guard veteran Ronald Grace, 87; Navy veterans Robert Hassinger, 58, Stanley Plonsky, 91, and Charles Debich, 94. State Rep. Eric Nelson, a Marine veteran and Hempfield native, referring to those who have served in the military, including nearly 200 local veterans of World War I and World War II listed on a monument near the Bovard pavilion. “It is our duty to ensure the sacrifices made by so many were not in vain.”",

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Joe Ryan pitched seven smooth innings for the Minnesota Twins, who got a two-run homer by Jose Miranda and a three-run shot from Trevor Larnach and hung on to beat the Kansas City Royals 6-5 on Monday in the opener of a four-game series. Ryan allowed one run and four singles while lowering his team-leading ERA to 2.96. The right-hander struck out nine and walked none. Ryan (4-3) has pitched at least into the sixth in each of his 11 starts this season. Alex Kirilloff’s two-out RBI single in the eighth inning gave the Twins (29-24) enough insurance to improve to 5-1 since a seven-game losing streak. Hunter Renfroe’s two-out RBI double in the ninth off Cole Sands put men on second and third and the tying run on deck for the Royals (34-21), before Jhoan Duran was summoned for the final out. Duran hit M.J. Melendez on the foot with an 0-2 curveball, and ninth-place hitter Dairon Blanco reached on a slow-rolling single to third base that cut the lead to three. Maikel Garcia hit a similar ball up the line that Willi Castro fielded but threw off balance and wildly off the bag for an error that allowed a second run to score. With Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. at the plate, Duran got him to hit a weak bouncer back to the mound to record his seventh save. Miranda took Alec Marsh (4-2) deep to the bullpen beyond left-center in the third inning. Larnach hit a two-out fastball into the upper deck above right field in the fifth, a smash measured at 441 feet and 109.1 mph that gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Marsh finished five innings with seven strikeouts. He allowed three other hits — all singles — beside the home runs. But his only two walks came in the fifth, preceding Larnach’s blast. The Royals have their first losing streak since a two-game skid from May 4-5 and just their second since April 30. Their eight-game winning streak was stopped on Sunday in Tampa Bay . TRAINER’S ROOM Royals CF Kyle Isbel was cleared for action after a full pregame workout but remained on the bench as a precaution, two days after fouling a ball off his face that caused a small fracture in his upper nose. The Royals have been remarkably healthy so far this season, but 2B Michael Massey just landed on the injured list with a lower back sprain. UP NEXT Royals: LHP Cole Ragans (4-3, 3.34 ERA) takes the mound on Tuesday night with a 13-inning scoreless streak over his last two starts with 19 strikeouts and just three hits allowed. Twins: RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (1-0, 2.57 ERA) pitches the second game of the series. In two starts at home this season, he has allowed only two runs over 11 innings with 14 strikeouts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "A HEALTH Maintenance Organisation, AVON Healthcare Limited, has reinforced its commitment to promoting healthy living by donating sanitary products to 500 underprivileged schoolgirls in Lagos in honour of World Menstrual Hygiene Day, celebrated globally today. This initiative was part of a community outreach programme held at Bright Achiever’s School in Bariga, Lagos, and also marked the end of their #PurpleLipsChallenge, a campaign celebrating women and raising awareness about menstrual hygiene. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Avon HMO, Adesimbo Ukiri, while highlighting the significance of the initiative, cited economic challenges and rising costs that make essential goods inaccessible for many Nigerians. She said: “The inability to afford personal hygiene products can significantly hinder a girl’s education and overall well-being, affecting their long-term development and potential to make meaningful contributions to the society. Through this initiative, we aim to ensure that girls can remain in school throughout the academic year, helping to create a future where women and men can equally contribute to the society. “By fostering partnership between the private sector and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), more girls can stay in school year-round, attaining the same educational opportunities as boys. Empowered girls become empowered women, and when both women and men have the necessary tools, they can actively contribute to building a more inclusive and thriving society. Launched in 2019, the #PurpleLipsChallenge encouraged women to share photos of themselves wearing purple lipstick on social media. For every photo posted, Avon HMO pledged to provide a schoolgirl with reusable sanitary products. This year’s campaign, like the one in 2019, gained local and international support, attracting participants from Nigeria, London, Texas, Abu Dhabi & Ontario. A key driver of this success was Avon HMO’s collaboration with Safety for Every Girl, an NGO focused on eradicating period poverty and advancing menstrual equity in Nigeria. Additionally, leading organizations such as Heirs Energies, United Capital Plc., Afriland Properties, and Avon Medical Practice lent their support. Beyond providing sanitary kits, Avon HMO empowered the girls by providing education on managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. This was done through health talks and practical demonstrations where they showed the girls how to properly use the sanitary kits. Period poverty remains a substantial barrier to education for many girls in Nigeria. According to UNESCO, one in ten girls in Sub-Saharan Africa misses school during their menstrual cycle, potentially losing up to 20% of the school year. This interruption not only hampers their academic progress but also limits their future prospects. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario — Federal anti-scab legislation passed 3rd reading today, clearing its final hurdle in the House of Commons, and significantly levelling the playing field for workers’ rights in federally-regulated sectors like communications and transportation. “This is a long-awaited victory for workers’ bargaining rights in Canada,” said CUPE’s National President Mark Hancock. “And let’s not forget, this is what happens when the NDP – backed by the labour movement – put the rights of workers front and centre in the House of Commons. Let’s also not forget that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has voted against anti-scab legislation not once, not twice, but eight times in the past. The Conservatives only voted for it this time because they knew better than to pick a fight with the labour movement as we approach the next election.” Currently, employers are able to hire scabs in order to break the morale and bank accounts of striking and locked out workers, as is the case with members of CUPE 2614 at the Port of Quebec, who have been locked out and replaced with scabs since September 2022. Employers also use scab labour to ship jobs out of the country, as is the case with members of CUPE 2815 who have been locked out from their jobs at Videotron in Gatineau, Quebec since October 2023. While these workers have gone seven months without a paycheque, Videotron is able to continue business as usual, while paying bottom-dollar to ship jobs out of the country. Anti-scab legislation will make all of this illegal. Employers will no longer be allowed to hire replacement workers (scabs) during strikes and lockouts, thereby balancing the scales and giving more power back to workers to fight for better wages and a better life. “Today we have climbed another rung on the ladder toward justice and fairness for workers,” said CUPE’s National Secretary-Treasurer Candace Rennick. “This marks an extraordinary milestone in the fight for workers’ rights in Canada, and a profound testament to the power of workers when we organize and join with our allies in Parliament to fight for what is right. We never gave up on the fight for anti-scab legislation for federally-regulated industries, and we won’t stop until it’s in effect in all jurisdictions across Canada.” Anti-scab legislation has already been shown to reduce the length and frequency of strikes and lockouts in Quebec and British Columbia where anti-scab laws are already in effect provincially. The Kinew NDP government in Manitoba has also promised anti-scab legislation. The federal legislation must now be confirmed by the Senate before receiving Royal Assent.

        "content": "North Korea's latest attempt to put a spy satellite into orbit ended in a mid-air explosion, Pyongyang said late Monday, hours after its announcement of a planned launch was criticised by Seoul and Tokyo. Putting a spy satellite into orbit has long been a top priority for Kim Jong Un's regime, and it claimed to have succeeded in November, after two failed attempts last year. Seoul claims Kim received Russian technical assistance for that launch, in return for sending containers of weapons to Moscow for use in Ukraine. But its attempt Monday to launch the \"Malligyong-1-1\" reconnaissance satellite ended in failure after it \"exploded in the air during the first flight stage and failed to launch,\" the North's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a statement. An \"expert review concluded that the cause of the accident was the operational reliability of the newly developed liquid oxygen and oil engine,\" the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, added. Japanese broadcaster NHK ran footage of what appeared to be a flaming projectile in the night sky, which then exploded into a fireball, saying it had filmed it from northeast China at the same time as the attempted launch. Pyongyang had notified Japan earlier Monday that it was planning to put another satellite into orbit, prompting criticism from both Seoul and Tokyo, which urged Kim to call it off. South Korea's military said it had detected the launch but that the satellite \"is presumed to have exploded in the air\". \"The South Korean and US intelligence authorities are analysing it in detail in close cooperation,\" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Nuclear-armed North Korea is barred by multiple UN resolutions from tests using ballistic technology, and analysts say there is significant technological overlap between space launch capabilities and the development of ballistic missiles. The launch \"is a provocative act that clearly violates the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the use of ballistic missile technology,\" South Korea's military said. The US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) called the launch a \"brazen violation of multiple unanimous UN Security Council resolutions\", and said in a statement that it \"risks destabilising the security situation in the region and beyond\". Japan briefly issued an alert warning residents of southern Okinawa prefecture to take cover in shelters, but it was lifted minutes later. The attempted launch came just hours after Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo wrapped up their first trilateral summit since 2019. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol said Monday that another satellite launch -- North Korea's fourth attempt -- would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability\". The South Korean military conducted attack formation flight and strike training on Monday to demonstrate \"the strong capabilities and will of our military\" after North Korea notified Japan of its plans to launch a satellite by June 4. Experts say that spy satellites could improve North Korea's intelligence-gathering capabilities, particularly over South Korea, and provide crucial data in any military conflict. Kim met President Vladimir Putin in Russia last September, and Putin suggested afterwards that his nation could help Pyongyang build satellites. Seoul and Washington have both subsequently accused Pyongyang of shipping weapons to Moscow, with South Korea saying earlier this year that Pyongyang had sent thousands of containers of weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. A group of Russian engineers entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. North Korea claims the \"Malligyong-1\" satellite it put into orbit in November is successfully functioning, but Seoul's intelligence agency has cast down on this claim. The North's two failed attempts last year included one in May which failed due to the \"abnormal\" startup of its second-stage engine, Pyongyang state media said at the time, and one in August which was attributed to an error in the \"emergency blasting system\". Seoul's National Intelligence Service collected and analysed debris from one of Pyongyang's failed launches earlier last year, finding it had no military utility. kjk-hs/ceb/sst/st",

        "content": "After causing multiple rainouts earlier this season, Mother Nature made up for it this weekend at Oxford Plains Speedway. The track hosted two days of racing to make up for past postponements. Regular Saturday-night Oxford Championship Series competition took place at its scheduled time, and then all the divisions were in action Sunday. Austin Teras captured the first 50-lap Super Late Model feature of the weekend. The part-time competitor who won multiple times at the track last year returned to victory lane, with a pair of early-season points championship contenders in Scott McDaniel and Steven Chicoine joining him on the podium. Other winners Saturday included: Jordan Russell (Limiteds and Street Stocks), Adam Stearns (Mad Bombers), Alex Mowatt (Thunder Stocks) and Jaxson Moreside (Rookies). The Wicked Good Vintage Racing Association visited Saturday night, with Matt Gosley winning the Outlaws feature and Dave Foster topping the field in the Hobby division. Brandon Varney turned his fortunes around Sunday. The SLM rookie placed 21st out of 24 starters Saturday, but at the end of Sunday’s 50-lap feature, the Auburn native captured his first win of the season and second of his career . Both have come while wheeling the car normally driven by Varney’s car owner, Dennis Spencer Jr. Dominic Curit was Sunday’s runner-up, and Calvin Rose Jr. rounded out the podium. Teras finished fifth in the 19-car field. Jordan Russell made it a weekend sweep in the Limiteds division. He settled for a fifth-place finish in Sunday’s Street Stocks feature, which was won by Billy Childs Jr., who was runner-up to Russell on Saturday. Brandon Johnson , who placed third in Saturday’s feature, slotted behind Childs in second Sunday. Among Sunday’s other winners were: Corey Morgan (Mad Bombers), Thomas Richards (Thunder Stocks), Liz Newton (Rookies), Adam Oneil (Rebels) and Matt Morneau (Cruisers). The track also hosted a 50-lap enduro, with Zach Audet conquering the 32-car field. WISCASSET WINNERS Mike Hopkins won his second straight Coastal 200 at Wiscasset Speedway on Sunday. That was the spotlight race of a slate that also included three other feature races. Adam Chadbourne added to his career trophy haul at the track by winning the Coastal Mod 50 Modifieds race, Jase Mongeon won the 25-lap Bob Weymouth Memorial race for the visiting NELCAR legends car series, and Dan McKeage Jr. captured the checkered flag for the 35-lap Strictly Streets division feature.

        "content": "A six-month battle to evict boats moored at Mosquito Creek Marina has left the boatyard a ghost town, with those few who remain fighting for a sense of community. In the weeks before Christmas, Nch’ḵay̓ Development Corporation, run by the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), announced it would be closing a number of its docks at its North Vancouver marina for repairs. The 500 boats and 38 boat sheds moored would have to vacate the marina by May 31. Those deemed residents – moorage customers of live-aboard boat sheds and live-aboard boats – have since been offered an extension, but will have to vacate at a later date, no earlier than September of 2025. The owners of the 65 floathouses at the marina are not facing eviction and will continue to receive the same 12-month moorage licence extensions they are accustomed to receiving, according to an update on the Nch’ḵay̓ website. Scott Burwood, one of a large number of ex-Mosquito Creek Marina tenants to have relocated to Point Roberts in the United States, considers himself “one of the lucky ones.” “There are about 50 of us who have moved to Point Roberts, and we’re grateful we managed to secure that, but there are still a lot of people in real trouble,” he said. “This is not just wealthy people’s boats that are down there, it’s a real community, an incredible community, and it’s sad that that would be discarded.” The promise of an extended stay offers small consolation to the live-aboards and floathouse owners that are adapting to living in a floating neighbourhood with far fewer neighbours, said floathouse owner of eight years Ginger Gosnell-Myers. “It is really empty right now, so many people have up and left,\" she said. With around 130 boats left remaining, and just 17 boat sheds, more than half of the marina’s boating population has already moved on, said Gary Muuren, executive vice president of operations at Nch’ḵay̓. Muuren said Nch’ḵay̓ had tried to assist boaters in any way it could, extending eviction dates where possible and making it a “real necessity” to aid boaters in finding a new home. “We reached out to approximately 100-plus marinas and they were all wonderful. There were people in Nanaimo, in Duncan, in Salt Spring Island that reached out ... it’s a whole community with wonderful people,” he said. Addressing the speculation among boaters that penned development is the reason for the mass eviction, Muuren said there is nothing at play other than a necessity to improve the safety of the marina. “We have not taken any steps in determining what the future would be,” he said. “This was driven by safety concerns, there are no other plans for [the marina] at the moment. It’s going to take time, at least a year, before we know what’s going to happen going forward.” An update to the Nch’ḵay̓ website states anyone who has not removed their property by May 31 will be mooring in an unlicensed slip, and Mosquito Creek Marina will \"deal with the vessels\" at the owners’ expense.",

        "content": "Russia's forces lost 15 armored patrol vehicles and over two dozen artillery systems in the past 24 hours of fighting, according to Kyiv's military. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, which provides daily estimates of Moscow's weaponry and equipment losses, said on Monday that Russia has lost over 14,000 APVs since the war began in February 2022. Kyiv also that Moscow lost 28 artillery systems, nine tanks, and over 40 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) between Sunday and Monday. Alongside a graphic of the loss estimates shared by Ukraine's Defense Ministry to X, formerly , Kyiv officials included a quote from the late French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte: \"The truest wisdom is a resolute determination.\" Ukraine's military also reported that 1,150 Russian personnel were \"eliminated\" in the past day of fighting, bringing Moscow's casualty estimate to 502,340 since it launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia does not publish reports regarding its own losses. A declassified U.S. intelligence assessment published in December 2023 said that Moscow had lost an estimated . \"The truest wisdom is a resolute determination.\" Napoleon Bonaparte The combat losses of the enemy from February 24, 2022 to May 27, 2024. reached out to Russia's Ministry of Defense for comment on Monday. The report comes as Russia has been the front lines in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Ukrainian President said on Sunday that Moscow appeared to be preparing for a new offensive in the Kharkiv region as well, which has seen an increase number of attacks from Russian troops in recent weeks. \"The one who does all this doesn't want peace,\" Zelensky said in a on Sunday. Reuters reported last week that Russian President was looking to along the current frontlines, according to four Russian sources familiar with the matter. One senior Kremlin official told the news outlet that Putin was \"ready for a ceasefire\" in fighting as well. Peace negotiations have been presented by both sides in the war on multiple occasions, although Ukraine and Russia have yet to agree to a set of standards for a pause in fighting. Ukraine's Armed Forces said on its page that Russia attacked the frontlines 80 times on Monday, including 10 \"combat clashes\" in the Kharkiv direction. Kyiv claimed that Russia suffered \"significant losses\" along the frontlines near the Kupiansk direction but said that Moscow \"continues to increase pressure\" near the village of Sivers'k. Near the town of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Ukraine's military said that its soldiers held off 21 attacks from Russia's troops, adding, \"Ukrainian defenders are not easy, but the situation is under control.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "description": "In competing globally with the U.S. for economic opportunity, rather than friend or competitor, Canada has often been roadkill",
        "content": "Countries may be friendly in engaging each other, but they are not friends. They are allies and competitors. And in competing globally with the United States for economic opportunity, Canada has often been roadkill. This need be front of mind as Canada again prepares a concerted effort to engage the U.S. after its November election and in advance of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review in two years. This roadkill reality has been a constant theme in Canada-U.S. relations from at least the 1950s, when the U.S. punished Canada for breaking its grain embargo of China during that country’s greatest famine, to the recent U.S. use of the NAFTA renegotiation (which produced the USMCA) to gain advantage over Canada in agriculture sales to China. In these and other cases, including U.S. enforcement of its embargo of Cuba, what starts as a measure to promote legitimate U.S. security concerns – advertently or inadvertently, and often with great hypocrisy – morphs into measures that benefit U.S. businesses and harm their competitors. This reality is set to worsen as the U.S. increases the scope, intensity and extraterritoriality of security measures it employs in its conflict with China. For example, it is already foreshadowed in U.S. hints that Canada’s slow compliance with seizing (what the U.S. claims are) forced-labour goods from China – as mandated under the USMCA – will be on the table in the coming review. In this hypersecurity environment, the warm, fuzzy romanticism of a friendship needs to be replaced by sober, clear-headed thinking as part of an overall retooling of how Canada engages the U.S. It is also necessary to draw lessons from how Canada has historically managed the tension between trade and security interests with the U.S. Between the mid-1950s and the early 60s, a low point in modern Canada-U.S. relations, Canada was losing global wheat sales through the U.S. use of political coercion abroad and subsidies disguised as foreign aid. This caused farm incomes on the Prairies to fall drastically, precipitating a crisis. Ottawa’s entreaties to Washington were ignored. Around this time, Canada gained entry into the Chinese wheat market, where the Americans were absent owing to an embargo on China, ostensibly for security reasons. Canadian grain sales grew; Washington was furious. Rather than discuss a more equitable sharing of global grain markets, the Kennedy administration had U.S.-based oil companies refuse to fuel grain ships at the Port of Vancouver and threatened Canada’s auto industry. At one point, the Americans suggested that they grant licences for Canada to violate the embargo, essentially to approve which Canadian products Canada could ship from Canadian ports and to whom. Most recently, during renegotiation of the North American free-trade agreement, the Americans, at the last minute, inserted a clause to deter negotiating a trade agreement with China, again ostensibly for security reasons. This clause, which allowed a country to leave the agreement if another negotiated a deal with China, had no new legal or material effect. The right to leave for any reason existed in previous treaty versions. It did, however, have a psychological impact, essentially scaring the Canadian public, private sector, media and politicians. But while Canada panicked, the Americans negotiated and then signed their own partial trade agreement with China, which gave specific, unique advantage to American agricultural exporters at the expense of Canadian counterparts. We’ve been to this rodeo too often not to know that the Americans use legitimate security concerns – such as the Cold War, containing Cuba and, more recently, countering China’s rise – to also realize commercial advantage. We have been and will continue to be good allies with the Americans on security issues. We need to learn to be better competitors, which we can do without hostility, aggression or a “beaver warrior” (a Canadian version of China’s “wolf warrior”) approach to economic diplomacy. We did so in the past. Whether Canada can rediscover that clarity in an era of greater economic, psychological and security dependence on the U.S. is an open question to be answered at the review of the USMCA two years hence.",

        "description": "Alex de Minaur has been talking confidently about enjoying his best run at Roland Garros - but a youthful American in Paris stands in his way.",
        "content": "It seems only yesterday the eternally fresh-faced Alex de Minaur was one of the much-touted NextGen hotshots, but now it's a new breed of teen tennis guns who are on his trail. \"He's a tall American, dangerous and with powerful groundstrokes,\" is de Minaur's verdict on his latest young hitman at the French Open, 19-year-old Alex Michelsen, who's already shot down the Australian No.1 once this season on a Mexican hard court. De Minaur is counting on the stocky, 1.93m Californian being a bit greener on the red clay but can't rely on it, with Michelsen, who's up to No.60 and will surely soon join his seven compatriots in the top 50, having downed fellow American world No.12 Taylor Fritz in Geneva last week. \"It should be a tough battle, and hopefully I can get my revenge,\" added de Minaur. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Australian tennis is counting on it, a mite desperate for its main man to prevail after a wretched start to the tournament with five players already out, one withdrawn though injury and not a winner on the board. De Minaur has got used to the responsibility of being the spearhead, and isn't talking down his expectations any more. At a mature 25 and having tasted life in the top 10 this year, he feels a quarter-final place, at least, in every slam should be achievable for him now. On clay, the world No.11 is adamant he's become a different player this year. \"I'm yet to go past the second round here in Paris, so that definitely has to be the first step, but I don't see why I can't play well,\" he told AAP. \"Adapting to clay has been a learning process. A lot of my improvement has probably had to do with me growing into my body a little bit more, getting a little bit stronger. \"My groundstrokes aren't probably as effective on the clay as they would be on other surfaces, so I've got to make sure that I'm nice and strong and physical with it. \"Getting that strength and power to help me out on the clay has been very important and, also understanding the type of tennis that I want to play on the surface and using a little bit more creativity, movement, speed to create more variety. \"It's all clicked together and I've gained a lot of confidence on the surface. And, mentally too, I've told myself that there's no reason why I can't play well on this surface.\" Should calamity befall de Minaur, there's at least one bit of good news on the horizon with one Aussie guaranteed for the second round from the Alexei Popyrin-Thanasi Kokkinakis clash. The shame, as their colleague Max Purcell noted, is that they're both playing well enough to have both gone on a good run. \"I'll be watching though,\" smiled Purcell. \"It's a popcorn match, definitely.\" \"He's one of my better mates on tour,\" says Kokkinakis, revealing that he and Popyrin had decided radio silence between each other might be the best bet before their clash. \"We practise a lot together. It is tricky - but it should be a fun one.\" AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION ON DAY THREE OF THE FRENCH OPEN (PREFIX DENOTES SEEDING): Men's singles Alexei Popyrin v Thanasi Kokkinakis 11-Alex de Minaur v Alex Michelsen (USA) Adam Walton v Arthur Rinderknech (FRA) Rinky Hijikata v Luciano Darderi (ITA)",

        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. Walton loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday , first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them. It was the only conference that the champion of the ‘Conference of Champions’ ever knew. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter/X: @ WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.

        "description": "Rescue teams believe they have found 19-year-old Julia Horn, who went missing on Thursday at Cerro Tres MaríasLa entrada German tourist presumed dead, body found at trekking spot in San Juan se publicó primero en Buenos Aires Herald.",
        "content": "There has been a widespread search in San Juan province for German tourist Julia Horn since she went missing last Thursday while trekking in the mountainous area called Cerro Tres Marías. However, the search was suspended on Monday after a body matching her description was found in the area. The 19-year-old was last seen on May 16 at around 11 a.m. when a security camera recorded her getting off a bus alone in El Castillito and heading to the Tres Marías trekking trail. Her phone last emitted a signal that day at 3:34 p.m. The weather was not suitable for trekking on Thursday, given that it was rainy and rocks could get slippery. The rain and intense fog persisted over the following days, making the search — which includes drones, helicopters, trained dogs, police, and a special rescue team — difficult. The search had to be temporarily called off on Sunday evening, and restarted on Monday morning, the first day with full sunlight since Horn disappeared. Hours later, a helicopter team reported a body at the bottom of a gorge, around 30 meters below the normal trekking path and 12 kilometers away from the trail’s starting point at the mountain base. “We presume it is Julia because [the body] matches her physical characteristics,” prosecutor Daniela Pringles told the press on Monday afternoon. “We can’t be certain until this is scientifically confirmed.” Retrieving the body is expected to take several hours, given it is very difficult to reach the place where it was found. “A female body was sighted from the helicopter and it matches all the images we have of Julia,” Pringles said. Prosecutor Ignacio Achem told the TN news network their main hypothesis is that Horn suffered a fatal accident, and added that the only way to get to the body’s location is by climbing the mountain with special gear. Horn arrived in Argentina around a month ago for an internship with the educational NGO Youth For Understanding. She spent her first two weeks in the country in Santiago del Estero province, then went to Catamarca and arrived in San Juan on Thursday. She was supposed to return to Germany on Sunday, she told San Juan’s Canal 8 news channel last week during a brief interview about her work in the province. According to the Mountain Prevention Group (GPM by its Spanish initials) — a provincial organization that regulated trekking in the Tres Marías area with certified mountain guides — recent government budget cuts have led to a lack of supervision and accident prevention in the area since December. “The reality is that the contract with the previous administration expired in December and we’ve been having conversations trying to bring it back since February. Unfortunately, everything’s been delayed again,” Ana Valles, the director of GPM, told the Herald . She explained that there have been several meetings since President Javier Milei took over the presidency, but no signed agreement with the new national authorities. “In the five years GPM lasted there were no reported deaths in any of the surrounding mountains, thank God, and we were able to resolve minor incidents without having to activate emergency protocols. We also advised over 30,000 tourists and the general public on the trails and safety precautions for being on the mountain.” There are several empty GPM outposts in the area, including at the base of the trail Horn embarked on. According to the Club Andino Mercedario, a local mountaineering club collaborating with the search for Horn, the Tres Marías’ rocky terrain has plenty of markers but can be tricky to explore with its narrow gorges and caves. Its peak is over 1000 meters above sea level and is one of the most popular mountainous areas in San Juan. The club told the Herald that best practices when trekking in the area include not venturing alone onto unknown trails and letting someone know of your whereabouts and the estimated time of arrival. There are also lists of certified local mountain guides available.",

        "description": "Walton supported the 'Conference of Champions' like nobody else during his career as a broadcaster for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network.",
        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. Walton loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday , first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them. It was the only conference that the champion of the ‘Conference of Champions’ ever knew. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter/X: @ WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.

        "description": "Hearing takes place Friday for Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer",
        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. RELATED: Two Abbotsford hog-farm protesters sentenced to 30 days in jail In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. RELATED: Guilty verdicts stand for 2 Abbotsford hog-farm protesters",

        "content": "Photo: Health Canada The B.C.-based vodka seltzer manufacturer, N?TRL, distributed 33,000 tumblers with sulfuric and phosphoric acids trapped between the cups' walls. At least 43 Canadians have fallen ill after tumblers branded by the B.C.-based vodka-drink manufacturer NÜTRL began leaking sulfuric and phosphoric acids trapped between the cups’ walls. Health Canada issued a recall of the product last week after 33,000 tumblers were distributed to customers as a promotional gift alongside 12- or 15-packs of NÜTRL seltzers between April 29 and May 17, 2024. “This solution may release when the tumbler is filled with liquid, posing a potential risk of serious injury,” said Health Canada in its recall. By May 23, dozens of people had fallen ill with reports of headaches, nausea, cramping and abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Health Canada also warned that affected people may experience burning of the lips, tongue, throat, stomach, and other tissue damage. NÜTRL, which opened its distillery in Delta, B.C., in 2013, said in a statement posted to its website that the recall began after the Chinese manufacturer, Suncope, contacted Health Canada warning of a defect. The statement said the substance inside the walls of the tumblers is a chemical cleaning solution that may result in elevated levels of iron, chromium and nickel. “Consumer safety is our top priority,” the statement reads. For more information, Health Canada advises consumers can call 1-866-846-1778 or email [email protected] . People experiencing any symptoms related to the recall should seek medical attention.",

        "description": "Hearing takes place Friday for Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer",
        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m.",

        "content": "After an uncharacteristic first round exit on Monday from the French Open, Rafael Nadal , the 'King of Clay' and one of the greatest to ever play tennis, may (or may not) have played the final match of his illustrious career. Roland Garros being his signature grand slam tournament — winning a record 14 titles in Paris and never losing in the first round until now — it was extremely unusual seeing the Spaniard matched up against No. 4-ranked Alexander Zverev so early in the draw. Even if Nadal, 37, decides to finish out this calendar season at Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and even the Olympics in between, the unceremonious 6-3, 7(7)-6(5), 6-3 loss to Zverev leaves a sour taste. See you soon, Rafa #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/dgGyoMyovu After missing most of 2023 with an abdominal injury, Nadal sported a 5-3 record on clay going into Paris but failed to reach a quarterfinal round since returning to competition in January. But despite that recent form, his legacy will endure as the gold standard for generations to come. Nadal's injuries may be the focus now but his longevity and lasting success give him a case as the greatest male player of all time. Since turning pro in 2001 at age 14, Nadal has won 22 individual grand slam titles, 59 Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Big titles ( both second all-time ), two Olympic gold medals and two Davis Cup titles for Spain. Not to mention his domination on clay courts alone. If this is it for Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros, he leaves an illustrious legacy behind on the clay: ◽️ 112 wins, 4 losses ◽️ Three separate 30+ win streaks ◽️ 14 titles (the most ever by a player at a single major) ◽️ Four titles won without losing a set H/T @rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/bJgVieKzf1 Nadal is one of two men to complete the so-called \"Career Golden Slam,\" winning all four grand slam tournaments and an Olympic gold, and stands alone as the only male to win all four grand slam tournaments and Olympic gold in singles and doubles. He is also one of four men all-time to win all four grand slam tournaments twice. His rivalries with Roger Federer (20 grand slam titles) and Novak Djokovic (24 grand slam titles), both also in the GOAT conversation, launched what was dubbed the \"golden age\" of tennis — a period from roughly 2008-22 when all but nine grand slam titles were won by one of the three players. Federer, 42, retired from tennis in 2022. And even though Djokovic, 37, has two more grand slam titles than Nadal and potentially still counting, he only has a humble 4-4 record against him at grand slams. Nadal is also the only one of the three to have a statue erected at one of the four grand slam venues ( Roland Garros ). VIDEO: Days before the French Open kicks off, a statue of Rafael Nadal is unveiled at Roland Garros pic.twitter.com/9YEIytjCtR Nadal's contributions off the court elevates his legacy even higher, founding the Rafa Nadal Academy in his home of Mallorca, Spain — which has already produced his potential successor in two-time grand slam champion and current No. 3-ranked Carlos Alcaraz. His charity, the Rafa Nadal Foundation, is internationally acclaimed and he even has his own brand with Nike akin to another GOAT, Michael Jordan. Nadal's career will end, sooner probably than later, but when that happens tennis won't just lose a 'king,' it will also add a god to its pantheon.",

        "content": "British number one Cameron Norrie slumped out of the French Open in the first round to Russian Pavel Kotov. Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Defeat for Cam Norrie at 🇬🇧 | — LTA (@the_LTA) Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. “I’m pretty devastated with the result, the first four sets I was in control, I had so many chances,” said Norrie. “I didn’t play well at all but I still should have won comfortably. I felt physically good, practice has been going well. I couldn’t believe I was in a fifth set.” Harriet Dart loses out to Linda Nosková in a tight 1st round match 🇬🇧 | — LTA (@the_LTA) Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Dart said: “I felt I played an OK match to be honest, I always knew it would be a tough match. I’m just disappointed I didn’t capitalise on some of my opportunities.” Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

After all, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor 's daughter revealed that she graduated from The Juilliard School in New York City with a degree in acting on May 24. Ella began her post with a reference to Taylor Swift 's song \"Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me,\" noting, \"YOU WOULDN'T LAST AN HOUR IN THE ASYLUM (@juilliardschool) WHERE THEY RAISED ME (No, like, really).\" \"Yesterday I got my BFA in Acting from Juilliard,\" the 22-year-old reflected in her May 25 Instagram post. \"I couldn't be happier to be done or prouder to have survived or more grateful to my family for the unwavering support that got me there and through. I have a degree in playing pretend!!! Yay!!!\" Ella shared a photo of herself donning a graduation cap and gown with her diploma in hand next to a Julliard advertisement featuring herself. She also included highlights from her graduation ceremony, sweet pics with her pals, a candid snap of her talking to the Zoolander star, and a solo pic in her cap and flowy, pale yellow gown. But it's no surprise Ella pursued her degree in acting. Christine—who also shares 18-year-old son Quinlin with Ben—revealed that the career was a longtime goal for her daughter. \"She came out of the womb with a mission, and I was never going to get in her way,\" the Arrested Development alum told UsWeekly in 2018. \"She is a very strong-minded, strong-willed young lady, and she loves it. Obviously she was born into the world, but I think living in New York City, she has been exposed to so many incredible things and shows and so ... she has the bug.\" But Ella isn't the only celeb kid to graduate this year.

Last week, the Naira showed a remarkable recovery, gaining marginal ground against the US dollar. The Naira started the week then at 1468.99/$1 and reached a weekly low of N1,485/$ before settling at N1,481/$ on Friday. On the other hand, average daily forex turnover ranged from $123 million and $261 million in the week. Additionally, during the week, the CBN offered a total of N508.98 billion during the Nigerian treasury bill (NTB) auction held on May 22, 2024. The subscription levels significantly surpassed the initial offer, highlighting the continued appetite for fixed-income securities amidst a volatile economic landscape. Despite the oversubscription reaching N1.5 trillion, only about N638.98 billion was allotted to treasury bill investors.",

        "content": "Like mother, like daughter! and her , looked identical as the duo attended the wedding of a friend together. As you can see in the clip below, Amanda and her young daughter glammed up together for the special occasion and the 12-year-old followed her mum in the glam department. The duo started off in matching pyjamas and sweetly helped each other out when it came to their makeup and hair. Hollie was even seen putting blush on her mum, before gently waving at the camera. When the pair unveiled their looks, they had another twinning moment, with both opting for floral dresses for the happy occasion. Amanda's friend only had one small hiccup with her wedding, the ever unpredictable British weather, which meant the bride walked underneath umbrellas as she made her way to the aisle. But taking it in their stride, Amanda joked: \"The very special wedding of our friend Rebecca the epic storm made it even more fabulous.\" Hollie recently joined her mum on and alongside , was responsible for sending Japanese skipping act Haribow to the semi-finals . Even though the judges had all used their golden buzzers this series, following chants from the crowd, Simon allowed Eric and Hollie to press the buzzer. Alongside Hollie, Amanda is also a mum to daughter Lexi, 18, and it appears the presenter isn't ready to wave goodbye when Lexi heads off to university later in the year. at the Born Free charity gala, the 53-year-old mused: \"I want her to live the biggest life she can live. So I'll have to say goodbye. But children always come back.\" This isn't the first time Amanda has shared her emotion over Lexi leaving the family home – the TV star broke down in tears during an episode of her programme with comedian Alan Carr, Amanda & Alan's Italian Job, when discussing her children flying the nest. \"They say you have 18 summers and then you're lucky to see them. It's so terrible because you wish so much of it away when you're a busy parent. And then you turn around and they're not even there,\" she said during a taping of the TV show. Lexi hasn't decided where she will study, and has even explored campuses in the United States. Amanda shares her two girls with record producer husband Chris Hughes. The pair met in Los Angeles in 2003 and began dating soon after. In 2008, the pair tied the knot with one-year-old Lexi in attendance. By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!

I'm Vasilious, your chorus call operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Turkcell’s Conference Call and Live Webcast to present and discuss the Turkcell’s First Quarter 2024 Financial Results. All participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. The presentation will be followed by question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Ozlem Yardim, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance Director. Ms. Yardim, you may now proceed. Ozlem Yardim Thank you, Vasilious. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Turkcell's first quarter 2024 earnings call. Today, our CEO, Ali Taha Koc and CFO, Kamil Kalyon will be delivering a brief presentation covering operational and financial results, which will be followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, I would like to kindly remind you to review our safe harbor statements available at the end of our presentation. Now I'm handing the meeting over to Mr. Ali Taha. Ali Taha Koc Thank you, Ozlem. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. At Turkcell, we are celebrating our 30th anniversary with great pride, having pioneered numerous milestones from our first call to becoming Turkey's leading technology provider. In the first quarter of 2024, we are delighted to share our successful results. By taking timely actions, we have delivered double-digit Real Growth despite global central banks tightening policies and reaccelerating inflation in Turkey. Our top line grew 12% to TRY31 billion with a remarkable 23% increase in EBITDA. These results have been driven by a rational price increases since 2021, which enabled mobile ARPU growth to reach 17% and fiber residential ARPU growth to reach 14%. Supported by lower energy and interconnection expenses, operating leverage expanded the EBITDA margin by 3.8 percentage points to 41.4%. Additionally, our commitment to focusing on value generating post-paid and fiber customer acquisition resulted in 333,000 net additions in the first quarter of the year. Overall, our strong operational performance resulted in a remarkable net profit of TRY2.6 billion. Our strong first quarter performance enabled us to revise our 2024 revenue growth upwards, which I will elaborate on later. Next slide, please. Let's take a look at our operational performance in the first quarter. Unlike previous quarters, competition in the mobile market was relatively less aggressive in this quarter. On the mobile front, we sustained our focus on the postpaid segment, which contributes more value to our financials, resulting in a net increase of 472,000 subscribers. Over the past 12-months, our postpaid base has grown with 1.7 million additions. Our postpaid customer base exceeded 27.6 million, reflecting 72% of the total on a three-point rise year-over-year. Disconnections from previous year's tourist lines, rising new acquisition price levels, and demand to alternative data solutions were the main factors behind the prepaid net loss of 243,000 subscribers. Our customer-centric and innovative approach contributed to a low churn rate this quarter. The churn rate in the mobile segment was at 1.5%, marking the lowest rate in the past six years. Driven by sequential price adjustments, upsell efforts, and an increased share of post-paid subscribers in the portfolio, blended mobile ARPU rose by 95% year-on-year and continued to outpace CPI. The base effect from the last year's earthquake contributed to the widening ARPU inflation gap in this quarter. Taking into account inflation adjustments, mobile ARPU recorded 17% yearly growth. Next slide, please, Ozlem. In the fixed broadband market, this year started with price adjustment in December, and the market has become more rational compared to the previous year. In the first quarter, we had 48,000 fiber customer additions to our portfolio, following focused investments in expanding our fiber footprint over past years. We are pleased to have added 41,000 IPTV subscribers, reaching the homes of 1.5 million customers. TV plus is a premier solution for fiber subscriber retention, enabling us to implement effective price adjustments, thanks to its rich content. With the contributions of TV plus, our pure fiber technology and a rational market, we achieved a fixed churn rate of 1.3%, marking the lowest level since 2007. Widening the gap with CPI, residential fiber ARPU growth continued to rise, achieving a 90% year-on-year growth on a historical basis. Our upsells are forced to higher speed packages and an increase in 12-month contract share within the customer portfolio were the main components of this outstanding performance. Similar to the mobile site, the base effect from last year's [Indiscernible] contributed to the widening ARPU inflation gap in this quarter. Lastly, we will be prioritizing fiber subscriber net additions over increasing home passes this year. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate lower new compass figures, compared to last year. Next slide. Let's discuss our strategic focus areas, starting with digital services and solutions. Standalone revenue from our digital services and solutions grew an impressive 32% year-on-year, primarily driven by a 29% revenue increase in digital OTT services, which has a 5.5 million paid user base. Among these offerings our TV services and personal cloud service were particularly instrumental. TV plus’ success is remarkable. As it has been the only platform consistently growing its market share since 2014. According to the ICTA report, the TV plus market share increased to 17.6%, cementing its second position as of ‘23 year-end. In the first quarter, digital business services generated TRY2.8 billion in revenue and secured more than 1,200 contracts. We remain committed to maintain our leading position in the data center market. Combined with our cloud services, revenues from those grew by 48% to TRY470 million. Next slide. Paycell, our innovative payment service platform, registered a remarkable quarter delivering 33% year-on-year growth. Rising interest rates and commission on post solutions as well as volume growth supported the top line. The 57% surge in Pay Later volume was positively affected by a 16% increase in the number of active users. Paycell EBITDA rose 47% year-on-year. The primary factor behind the rise in the margin is post-expense growth lagging behind its revenue increase. Financing customers' technological needs, finance sales revenues rose 53% on a surging loan portfolio, higher average interest rate and the contribution of insurance business revenues. The higher cost of funding stemming from tight monetary policies secures finance sales profitability similar to the banking sector. This was reflected in the next -- in the net interest margin, which narrowed by 2.4% point this quarter. Since financial issues loans with relatively shorter maturities, we expect this pressure to decline in the second-half of the year. Meanwhile, our cost of risk is at 1.7%, which is lower than first quarter of 2023. Next slide. Lastly, our performance in the international markets. Turkcell’s international revenues, which account for 3% of group revenues, rose 2.2% to TRY815 million. Best revenues rose 24% on a yearly basis in local currency terms, primarily driven by higher data, SMS and service revenues. The 3.2% point improvement in EBITDA margin was sustained by dedicated cost management. Next slide. I would like to end by sharing our revision for 2024 guidance. Given our first quarter performance, we revise our 2024 revenue growth guidance to low-double-digit growth. For EBITDA margin and CapEx intensity, we maintain our guidance. I will now leave the floor to our CFO, Mr. Kamil Kalyon. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much, Ali Taha. Now let's move on to our financial results. Our consolidated revenue increased by 11.8% on a yearly basis to TRY30.8 billion. The Turkcell Turkey segment was the biggest supporter of the Group topline growth with a 13% rise on a year-on-year basis. This was driven mainly by an expanding subscriber base, particularly on the postpaid side, and strong ARPU growth, thanks to sequential price adjustments with successful upselling efforts. The Techfin segment contributed TRY460 million to the top line with the strong performances of Paycell and Financell, which grew 33% and 54% respectively. Next slide, please. In the first quarter of 2024, EBITDA rose 23% on a yearly basis to TRY12.8 billion, thanks to strong revenue growth. The EBITDA margin expanded 3.8 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the increase in personal expenses due to the [Indiscernible] annual wage rise and the increased funding cost of our financing operation, the Group EBITDA margin benefited from a decline in the cost of goods sold, energy expenses, and interconnection expenses as a percentage of revenue. After the electricity prices increase in 2023, which was relatively low compared to inflation and our corresponding price adjustments in line with the inflation, the proportion of energy expenses to our revenue decreased, thereby supporting the EBITDA margin. Additionally, the continued decline in MTR positively impacted our profitability. A trend expected to persist throughout 2024. Next slide, please. Now let's dive into the net income performance. Thanks to a robust operational performance, EBITDA has contributed TRY2.4 billion to net income. The net FX loss item has pressured net profit by TRY1.8 billion, due to higher foreign exchange rate change, which is partially offset by mark-to-market of financial derivatives. By the first quarter, the increased weight of non-monetary assets on the balance sheet, the dividend distribution, which decreased retained earnings, and higher inflation indexation resulted in a positive impact of TRY3.1 billion on net profit, marked under the monetary gain and loss item. Despite the positive impact of indexation between statutory reporting and IFRS, deferred tax decreased, compared to the previous period. Lower corporate tax also supported the net profit. Next slide, please. Let's take a closer look at our CapEx management. The CapEx to sales ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was 18.2% with accelerated revenue. As we plan to accelerate our data center and renewable energy investments in the upcoming quarters and given the seasonality of the second-half, we expect to reach 23% CapEx intensity for 2024. In this quarter, we primarily focused our investments on mobile and fixed assets. Fixed-site investments are primarily driven by tower fiberization. We remain committed to achieving our fiberization target of 41% within this year. The share of data center investments within the total investments for this quarter appears small. Yet, we expect this proportion to increase over the coming quarters in line with our target of installing an additional 9.1 megawatt capacity. Thanks to the modular structure of our data centers, we simply add new modules as demand arises. Next slide, please. Now let's turn our attention to the balance sheet. In Q1 2024, our cash position is at TRY49 billion. Note that a total of TRY5.2 billion wireless usage tax payments, the second installment of the earthquake donation, and employee bonuses had a negative effect on our cash position. Additionally, we have invested in euro bonds for effective cash management. Our gross debt was at TRY98 billion, and we ended this quarter with a net debt position of TRY33 billion. Due to the decreasing cash position, our net leverage slightly increased to 0.6 times. This year, our FX debt service is around $340 million, which we consider quite manageable given our strong cash position. We possess an adequate cash reserve to fulfill the 10-year euro bond redemption in 2025 and are exploring a range of funding alternatives for the reissues. The majority of our cash remains denominated in hard currencies, excluding FX swaps, 49% of our cash is in U.S. dollars and 24% in euros. Next slide, please. Lastly, let's look into the management of foreign currency risk. In the first quarter of this year, our balance sheet had around $2 billion equivalent in FX financial liabilities. In addition to the $1.6 billion equivalent FX denominated financial assets, we have a $700 million effective hedging portfolio, the vast majority of which consists of futures, forward and NDFs. Since we believe the Turkish lira has entered a period of real appreciation and with hedging costs in the market having risen significantly over the past couple of years, we plan to reduce our derivative portfolio in the coming periods. As of this quarter, we have a net FX position of $158 million, due to our plans to reduce our derivatives portfolio, it's fair to expect our net FX position to decrease in the coming periods, while remaining with our neutral FX range of minus and plus $200 million. This concludes our presentation and we can now open the line for questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Tiron Cesar with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tiron Cesar Yes, hi. Good evening. Thanks for the call and for the opportunity to ask questions. I have three questions, but they're all easy. The first one, if that's okay. The first one is on the guidance increase on the revenue. What surprised you the most in the past, let's say one, two months, so you had to hike this guidance? That would be the first question. The second question, I would like to understand what exchange rate are you assuming in your budget for the lira? And let's say, if the lira depreciates less than per your budget, could it be that you spent a little bit less CapEx, so maybe the CapEx intensity will be less than your guidance? And then the third question, going back to the datacenters, can you please explain your ambition in the field and how large do you think the capacity would be in the medium term? Thank you so much. Ali Taha Koc Hi, Cesar. Thank you very much for the question. We had a quarter with solid financial and operational performance actually, which has beyond our initial plans. Accordingly, our revenue growth guidance for 2024 increased to low-double-digit growth, and there's no change in our EBITDA margin and CapEx adjusted guidance. However, given the macroeconomic dynamics, projecting inflation will be challenging, and the actual figures may vary according to the realization -- realized inflation and other factors such as the cyclicality of revenues. And also the minister of treasury and finance [Indiscernible] announced that the middle term plan OVP, is planned to be reviewed at the end of summer. Accordingly, we will be closed following the macroeconomic developments for possible further revision. But to say true that the first quarter -- first couple of months of this quarter is better than our expectations, so that's the reason that we revised our guidance. For the datacenter business, we're expecting -- we already have four big high-tech datacenters, and we are planning to build more and actually we are looking for a collaboration with big companies to bring the data, whatever it is with data we have in the Turkey, we want to keep it and we want to be a data hub for this region. So that's the reason that we have a huge ambition about the data center business. So currently we have four big data centers and we are adding more to them and then in the future you're going to see more coming from Turkcell. Kamil Kalyon For the second question, normally our year-end U.S. dollars FX rate estimation is TRY37.5 and the average rate we are assuming TRY34. We believe that we will be in line with our guidance for the full-year for the CapEx side. However, in case of a spike in the FX rate, if it realizes within the years, we can postpone our discretionary CapEx in order to create a buffer. We are chasing the developments in the economical side, but most probably the FX rate will be realized within our estimations this year. Tiron Cesar Thank you so much. That was very clear. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator The next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Barclays. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hello, good evening. Can you hear me? Ali Taha Koc Yes, loud and clear. Unidentified Analyst Good. Thank you very much for the presentation and congrats on the results. It's also great news about the upgraded guidance. I have two quick questions, so my first one, you mentioned that your cash position decreased because of investments in Eurobond. Could you please elaborate on that a little bit? And my second question is related to Ukraine. Obviously, we've seen some headlines in the news about potentially positive developments. But, my question would be, what will you do with the process from this asset sale? Will you do you plan to pay additional dividends or do you plan to use that for CapEx or maybe for your Eurobond repayment? That's it. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much. I will give the answer for the first one. The duration of the euro bond is five years. Turkish Sovereign and Bank, when we look at the, for example, yields in the Eurobonds, there's a high yield when we compare it with the deposit rates. Therefore, we prefer to invest Eurobonds in order to benefit from the high yields. For the second question maybe you can give. Ali Taha Koc As you may know in April the seizure of our -- on our Ukrainian assets lifted. It's a positive news. We are now waiting the necessary permission from our anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine. So this is the last step for the conclusion -- concluding of this deal. Although we do not have a board decision regarding the proceeds we will obtain from the sale of our assets in Ukraine, we have important investment projections in the coming period, such as data centers, solar energy and as well as the 5.5G auctions. So we will we are looking for huge investments projections in the coming period. Unidentified Analyst Got you. Thank you. So, do you still see the deal closing during this year? Ali Taha Koc Yes, definitely. Because there are two big roadblocks, one is just this seizure and another one is the anti-monopoly committee. Other than that, everything is clear. So hopefully, after this permission from the anti-monopoly committee of Ukraine finalized, hopefully near future and we are talking about in the period of months, we're expecting that's going to be done in this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Thank you very much. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Ignebekçili Murat with HSBC. Please go ahead. Ignebekçili Murat Hello. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Can you clarify the calculation of net debt? I think you have changed something over there, because I see that the FX deposit accounts are no longer included in the net cash calculation. Am I missing something here? Kamil Kalyon Murat, we do not have any change in our net debt position calculation of net debt position. We are using the same method. Ignebekçili Murat Net cash still the total cash is at TRY48.8 billion, and when we get to the... Kamil Kalyon Some portion of cash is categorized in the financial assets. Maybe it might. Ignebekçili Murat Yes, yes, exactly. So why don't you include those in the cash calculation? Kamil Kalyon We included. Normally we have TRY49.5 billion in our hand and TRY15.1 financial assets. And for example, when you look at our leverage 0.58, these two amounts are included into this calculation. Ignebekçili Murat Okay, when I look at the footnote, so I see 40 almost TRY49 billion as cash and also TRY10 billion as financial assets separately. That's why I... Kamil Kalyon [Technical Difficulty] roughly. Ignebekçili Murat TRY15? Kamil Kalyon Fifteen, yes. Ignebekçili Murat Okay, we can follow-up on this later. Kamil Kalyon Okay. Ignebekçili Murat And were there any working capital issues in the first quarter? Because there's around almost TRY12.5 billion EBITDA, around TRY7.5 billion CapEx in the quarter. Kamil Kalyon Yeah, Murat. Ignebekçili Murat So -- and the change in net debt and the net debt increased TRY6 million or TRY7 million. So I think there should be some negative impact from working capital, right? Or is it tax payments or anything like that? Can you clarify that, please? Kamil Kalyon Normally, we hit around TRY9.9 billion cash outflow in this quarter related to working capital side. This was mainly driven by the as you know, we are -- we paid the second installment of the earthquake donation, in January. Additionally, we paid personal bonus payments in February. And in February, again, we paid a huge amount of wireless fee tax payments as we have some payments to our suppliers and decreased trade payments in Q1 ‘24 compared to the first quarter of the last year. We are closely following our net working capital side and I think we will recover especially collection of the wireless fee tax payment from our clients, our net working capital structure will be better in the coming periods. Ignebekçili Murat Okay. Thank you very much. And finally, when you look at the financial expenses during the quarter of very limited FX activity or limited FX depreciation? We have financial expense as I see around more than TRY5 billion of FX losses. Could you elaborate on that, please? Kamil Kalyon Yes. Normally, as you said, I think around 6% or 7% depreciation in the FX rate realized in Q1. But as you know, along with the sequential rate hikes from the CBT side short-term rates and hedging costs increased very significantly. Therefore, this was the main driver behind the increase of our FX loss and the financial expenses. In addition to the credit rates are also increased very much before the election side, you remember. Therefore, these three effects affected our FX position or FX loss side negatively. Ignebekçili Murat So is it safe to assume that given that the interest rates in the market have already settled at some level, albeit very high, we should not see further significant FX losses in the coming months? The price is only the market-to-market? Kamil Kalyon Yes. As mentioned in my speech, our expectation in the FX side, we are not expecting a very high increases in the FX side. Therefore, most probably in order to decrease our hedging costs, we would like to make it short position might be in the coming periods in order to reduce our financial costs, because our estimation regarding the FX rates I think it will go for a short or mid-term side. We are not expecting any FX increases in this year. Therefore, most probably we will be opening a short position in our net FX position. Ignebekçili Murat Thank you. That's very clear. And finally, about the operation. When you look at a typical postpaid client, it is to renew this contract? What is the, like, front book, like-for-like, growth in the invoice if one is to renew this contract, compared to last year. So a new contract renewal price is up how much on a year-on-year basis? Kamil Kalyon Normally, as we said, our revenues grew by around 13% in [Indiscernible] site, the first site. And we have a very how can I say, our ARPU rates are increasing very well when we compare it to the last period, it's around 17% we have ARPU rate hike? And when we look at, for example, starting from the 2025, we had -- we made a lot of price increases and more than a 100% increase in prices within the last 20 months. We can easily say that, because we successfully implement our inflation pricing policy. Ali Taha Koc Invoice to invoice, you can talk about 100%, more than 100% invoice to invoice. Ignebekçili Murat Yes. So a typical platinum tariff is up 100% in manual terms, compared to same week last year? Kamil Kalyon Might be. Ali Taha Koc Might be. We are talking about the blended ones, but we're not talking about the markets or platinum. We're just talking about the blended. Ignebekçili Murat So yes, and the inflation rate hopefully declines in the coming quarters. In the interim, this will translate into a much larger number. I see. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator The next question comes from the line of Demirtas Cemal with Ata Invest. Please go ahead. Demirtas Cemal Thank you for the presentation and congratulations for very good results. My first question is about your strategic focus area. I see a little bit more momentum in both the Techfin Business and Digital Services revenue side? Could we expect this track to continue going forward? Because in previous years there was a little bit slower growth, but I see higher momentum. Is it sustainable? This is my first question. The second question is how do you see the consumer sentiment in your front? Do you see any changes in the consumer behavior and could you give us some color on the roaming sites? What are your expectations on that side? Thank you. And the last question is again, it has been asked about the net debt. What was the amount of wireless pretax paid in the first quarter? Thank you. Ali Taha Koc Again, let me start with the strategy focus areas. I just want to say that our momentum is going to keep on going till the end of the year and then most probably into the next year as well. So Techfin and DSS side is going to grow. And for example, Paycell saw a quarter with double-digit real growth performance, Paycell. And then also the meanwhile, finance also supported the Techfin segment growth as well in the first quarter of 2024. And also, our Digital Business Services will grow and with the digitization of the older companies, as well as the public sector. They're expecting that, that growth and the momentum is going to continue. So everybody wants to be digital and at the end of the day, Turkcell is a leading integrator and leading technology firm in Turkey. So we will be happy to digitalize and just support them in their businesses. So we're expecting especially the data center business as well as the co-op businesses is going to grow faster than we expect. So hopefully, we're going to see this momentum keep ongoing. Kamil Kalyon Demirtas, we paid TRY1.7 billion while fixed payment in February. As you know, we are paying in advance to government side and we are collecting this from our customers within the year. Demirtas Cemal Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You’re welcome. Demirtas Cemal And the consumer trends at roaming site? Ali Taha Koc So we are closely following that part as well. But, for us, what we are doing is we are just doing some new campaigns about the smart contracts. So we are just letting all the users to see if their tariff is over or not, and then we just make that, that service free of charge. So we are trying to improve our Net Promoter Score as well. So we are seeing that it is kind of easy technologically easy, especially with the electronic and eSIM, but we are closely following the trends. And then we are in order to convince people to use our eSIM or just our subscriber domain. And, so we will close the following it up, but I to say the truth that I will tell you more when we have more data, especially during this tourist season, especially the summer. We're going to see the numbers, because this is going to be the first time that we're going to see lots of tourists with electronic sin -- eSIM. So that's the reason that we're going to see the impact, both positive and negative. We have more data. I will talk more better at the end of the summer. Demirtas Cemal Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Mandaci Ece with UNLU Securities. Please go ahead. Mandaci Ece Thank you very much for the presentation and congratulations on your strong guidance. So my question is about the corporate revenues. I see [Indiscernible] I see a 3% decline in your corporate revenues. Digital business solution revenue is flat, but apart from it, I'm noticing some decline. Is this just for the first quarter? Do you expect as I can understand, you're expecting some drop over there going forward, but what was specifically the reason for this decline in the first quarter? Thank you. Ali Taha Koc So let me talk about the DBS and then the revenues growth for this quarter. Especially, our digital business services revenues remained flat in first quarter of 2024, mainly due to the fewer one-off large budget projects and hardware sales, compared to last year. And actually, additionally, revenues from public sector clients dropped from 41% Q1 of last year to 24% this quarter. And then also, it indicates reality and indicating a slowdown in public sector sales mainly due to the saving measures in the public. At this point, we're compensating for the slowdown with our value-added and recurring services and like data center and cloud businesses. So hopefully, we're just going to compensate this slowdown effect from the public sector. Kamil Kalyon Normally, we do not have any problem for the recurring service in the corporate side. As Ali Taha mentioned, we have three significant projects in the last quarter of 2023. Therefore, within the year’s most probably we do not -- we will close or we will realize real growth in the corporate side also. Mandaci Ece So margin wise, was this the reason -- one of the reasons why you had, I think a better margin maybe? Could there be a [Indiscernible] with the expected increase, could there be a margin dilution effect in the quarters ahead? Kamil Kalyon From -- are you asking from the consumer side or the from the corporate side? Mandaci Ece Corporate side, I mean. Kamil Kalyon In the corporate side from the recurring side, it's all the recurring -- the income coming from the tariffs, we do not have any dilution regarding the margin side and we are a little bit sensitive from the project perspective, because this year would be a little bit hot for the corporations and state establishments for the budget purposes. Therefore, we do not want to enter risky projects in this year. Therefore, we are selecting the more profitable and no any double receivable risk projects within this year. Therefore, we do not wait or expect a margin dilution in the corporate side also. But as you know, the terminal side or that how can I say, hardware side is a little bit less profitable issues. But we are very good at for example balancing this issue and we do not want to dilute our EBITDA margin and we are very careful about the baskets, which we how can I say prepared for this project? Mandaci Ece Thank you. Kamil Kalyon You're welcome. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Turkcell Management for any closing comments. Thank you. Ali Taha Koc Again, thank you very much for the time and I will be happy to present you our Q1 great results. So hopefully, we're going to have the similar and then better results in the Q2. Hope to see you next time. Thank you. Kamil Kalyon Thank you very much. Hope to see you. Ozlem Yardim Thanks for joining. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded, and you may disconnect your telephone. Thank you for calling and have a pleasant evening.",

        "content": "As keynote speaker William “Bill” Taylor offered an emotional and harrowing account of his time as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War, the true measure of sacrifice came into focus for those gathered at Historic Maplewood Cemetery for Crown Point’s Memorial Day service on Monday. Taylor, author of the book “On Full Automatic,” confessed that it was the first Memorial Day service he has attended. But has come to terms with the sacrifice he and his Marine band of brothers gave in the name of freedom. At 18 years old, Taylor enlisted in the Marines and was assigned to the First Battalion, Third Marine Regiment, Vietnam, serving nearly all of his 13-month tour during 1967 until he received his third Purple Heart medal and earned a trip home. The posting of the colors occured during the Memorial Day ceremony on Monday at Historic Maplewood Cemetery. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Taylor spoke of consistent enemy engagements and fierce battles against North Vietnamese troops. He said he still speaks to the widow of his platoon leader, David Hart, who was killed in action during a landing force invasion assaulting a tree line that “felt like the Civil War days.” He recalled the loss of numerous fellow Marines during intense battles, including Operation Buffalo. “I remember we were surrounded by 200 NVA (North Vietnamese Army troops) and my best friend was killed,” said Taylor, choking back tears. “It was that day I also earned by third Purple Heart.” The American Legion Post 20 float rolls by during Crown Point’s Memorial Day parade on Monday. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Taylor’s Marine Battalion received two Presidential Unit Citations while participating in 25 combat operations. His platoon was wiped out several times, once leaving only seven out of 50 men standing. Every platoon lieutenant, sergeant and squad leader was killed, wounded or relieved of command, he said. Taylor emphasized that the scars of battle are not only physical but mental, and that while many Vietnam veterans succumbed to suicide, the suicide rate among Gulf War veterans “averages 22 a day.” As a parade through the city featuring America the Royal Regiment and Crown Point High School marching band, the crowd gathered at the cemetery for the posting of colors. American Legion Post 20 Commander Kevin Dvorak, a 10-year U.S. Navy veteran, led with opening remarks, acknowledging Gold Star families in attendance, as well as participation from American Legion Auxiliary, Sons of the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, the Polar Star Battalion of the U.S. Navy Sea Cadets and several local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops. William “Bill” Taylor (left), the keynote speaker for Crown Point’s Memorial Day ceremony, offered an emotional and harrowing account of his time as a U.S. Marine during the Vietnam War in a speech at Historic Maplewood Cemetery on Monday. He is pictured alongside American Legion Post 20 Commander Kevin Dvorak. (Jim Masters/Post-Tribune) Dvorak recalled a more recent loss of American troops. “Navy SEALs Nathan Ingram and Christopher Chambers attempted to board an unflagged ship in the Arabian sea that was carrying Iranian-made weapons to Yemen last January 11,” he said. “As these two brave men were leaving their ship to climb the contraband ship, waves reportedly widened the gap between the two vessels. Chambers plunged into the water. Ingram jumped in to save him. Both were lost at sea and presumed dead.” He described Memorial Day as an occasion to honor more than 42 million men and women who died for our nation serving in wars and missions since the American Revolution. “The Global War on Terror, October 2001 to present, has resulted in nearly 1 million more deaths,” he noted. Taylor reminded that it wasn’t until the Vietnam War that the country changed its policy to bring all deceased soldiers home. “Often while the efforts to do so was gallant, it was not always possible,” he said. “Our records still include 90,000 MIAs. Others found peace at Arlington (National Cemetery) or here in Maplewood.” Dvorak recalled the death on April 1 of 102-year-old Lou Conter, the last living survivor of the USS Arizona, which sunk in the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Quoting Conter’s remarks to the American Legion, Dvorak said, “We’re not heroes. The 1,117 men who went down with the ship are the heroes. You have to remember, we got to go home, get married, have children and grandchildren, and we’ve lived a good life. Those who didn’t get to do that should be called the heroes.” Speaking on behalf of Crown Point Mayor Pete Land, who was away attending a family funeral, City Councilman Chad Jeffries, D-1st, said the service was an opportunity for the community to come together “united in respect and reverence for the heroes who had given their all.” “Today, let us also remember the families who have borne the burden of loss with grace and strength,” Jeffries said. “Their resilience is a testament to the enduring spirit of our nation. We honor their sacrifice as well, acknowledging the deep and personal cost of the freedoms we cherish.”",

        "content": "after a battle with cancer at the age of 71, and the . The tributes and memories fans, players, and media members shared of Walton offered a terrific example of how he had such a lasting impact on the game. From his time at UCLA to Portland to San Diego to Boston, people posted stories of Walton’s on-court prowess and anecdotes from his career. Others remembered Walton’s time calling the NBA on NBC, providing the soundtrack to the biggest games of the 90s. Many younger fans remember Walton’s most recent chapter as a broadcaster, calling college basketball games (mostly in the Pac-12) for ESPN. His partner for the majority of those games was Dave Pasch, who had an incredible chemistry with Walton, playing the straight man trying to call games while Walton wandered about, going down whatever path his mind presented to often discuss anything and everything but the game. They were a joy to watch, and on Monday, Pasch called in to to offer a remembrance of his longtime partner and share a touching anecdote about Walton, the person. \"I love you, but don't tell anybody.\" Bill Walton's longtime broadcast partner reflects on one of his favorite memories of his friend ❤️ — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) He also offered up an incredibly funny story of how they made up a bit about George Lucas creating Chewbacca in Walton’s image and then it got picked up by big entertainment outlets. Dave Pasch talks about the Chewbacca audition story that Bill made up on air in February, their last game together and the last time Dave saw him — CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) It is a perfect tribute to Walton by someone who knew him like few do, and a glimpse into the man who was a truly unique force. Another of Walton’s play-by-play partners, Jason Benetti, who called games with him on ESPN and later joined Walton for the always bizarre Throw It Down simulcast on NBA League Pass, posted a similarly fitting tribute to the legend.

        "content": "It seems only yesterday the eternally fresh-faced Alex de Minaur was one of the much-touted NextGen hotshots, but now it's a new breed of teen tennis guns who are on his trail. \"He's a tall American, dangerous and with powerful groundstrokes,\" is de Minaur's verdict on his latest young hitman at the French Open, 19-year-old Alex Michelsen, who's already shot down the Australian No.1 once this season on a Mexican hard court. De Minaur is counting on the stocky, 1.93m Californian being a bit greener on the red clay but can't rely on it, with Michelsen, who's up to No.60 and will surely soon join his seven compatriots in the top 50, having downed fellow American world No.12 Taylor Fritz in Geneva last week. \"It should be a tough battle, and hopefully I can get my revenge,\" added de Minaur. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Australian tennis is counting on it, a mite desperate for its main man to prevail after a wretched start to the tournament with five players already out, one withdrawn though injury and not a winner on the board. De Minaur has got used to the responsibility of being the spearhead, and isn't talking down his expectations any more. At a mature 25 and having tasted life in the top 10 this year, he feels a quarter-final place, at least, in every slam should be achievable for him now. On clay, the world No.11 is adamant he's become a different player this year. \"I'm yet to go past the second round here in Paris, so that definitely has to be the first step, but I don't see why I can't play well,\" he told AAP. \"Adapting to clay has been a learning process. A lot of my improvement has probably had to do with me growing into my body a little bit more, getting a little bit stronger. \"My groundstrokes aren't probably as effective on the clay as they would be on other surfaces, so I've got to make sure that I'm nice and strong and physical with it. \"Getting that strength and power to help me out on the clay has been very important and, also understanding the type of tennis that I want to play on the surface and using a little bit more creativity, movement, speed to create more variety. \"It's all clicked together and I've gained a lot of confidence on the surface. And, mentally too, I've told myself that there's no reason why I can't play well on this surface.\" Should calamity befall de Minaur, there's at least one bit of good news on the horizon with one Aussie guaranteed for the second round from the Alexei Popyrin-Thanasi Kokkinakis clash. The shame, as their colleague Max Purcell noted, is that they're both playing well enough to have both gone on a good run. \"I'll be watching though,\" smiled Purcell. \"It's a popcorn match, definitely.\" \"He's one of my better mates on tour,\" says Kokkinakis, revealing that he and Popyrin had decided radio silence between each other might be the best bet before their clash. \"We practise a lot together. It is tricky - but it should be a fun one.\" AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION ON DAY THREE OF THE FRENCH OPEN (PREFIX DENOTES SEEDING): Men's singles Alexei Popyrin v Thanasi Kokkinakis 11-Alex de Minaur v Alex Michelsen (USA) Adam Walton v Arthur Rinderknech (FRA) Rinky Hijikata v Luciano Darderi (ITA)",

        "description": "The OAS clawback is a hated tax measure but pensioners can avoid it or lessen the tax bite with proven strategies.The post Avoid the OAS Clawback: Earn $560 a Year the Smart Way appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Most Canadian pensioners hate the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback or recovery tax. If their annual income is above the OAS threshold, pensioners pay a 15% tax on excess earnings. Since its introduction in 1989, many have discovered strategies to avoid the OAS clawback, if not lessen the tax bite. However, a proven way to offset the recovery tax is to utilize the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA). Your OAS pension is not at risk if you generate additional income from the . Pensioners can boost OAS benefits by opting to delay the payments. The maximum amount ($713.34 in 2024) increases by 0.6% per month (7.2% per year) before 70 or a permanent 36% increase in five years. The rationale for this option is that you receive higher benefits when you are older and your income is lower. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows spouses or common-law partners to split their pensions. Pensioners can transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to a spouse who is earning less income. The CRA assumes that the transferring and receiving spouse or common-law partner are 65 or older. Many income investors invest in ( ) for generous dividends. At $13.49 per share, the yield is 8.01%. suggest reducing investments in non-registered accounts if you’re avoiding the OAS clawback. Freehold Royalties is a significant energy sector player but is not an oil producer. The $2.03 billion energy royalty company owns oil and natural gas royalties in Canada (6.2 million acres) and a sizeable, expanding land base in the U.S. (1.1 million gross drilling acres). The company has interests in more than 18,000 producing wells and benefits from the robust drilling activities in the royalty lands. It collects or receives royalty income from over 380 industry operators. Freehold is a royalty-interest owner, and operators spend for or cover all costs such as capital, equipment, operating, and maintenance. Besides the hefty dividend yield, the $2.03 billion energy royalty company pays monthly dividends. A $7,000 investment will produce $560.70 annually, but taxable in a non-registered account. All income, interest, or capital gains inside a TFSA are tax-free. Withdrawals are likewise tax-exempt. A cheaper and eligible stock in a TFSA is ( ). At only $5.82 per share (+10.01% year to date), you can partake in the 6.19% dividend. This $744.5 million company is Canada’s largest refined sugar distributor. It is also a producer of high-margin maple products. Sugar is a low-growth business but a very stable one. Furthermore, the consumer staple stock rarely experiences wild price swings, so price volatility is not a concern. In the first half of fiscal 2024, revenue and net earnings increased 10.3% and 8% year over year to $589.6 million and $27.9 million, respectively. Rogers Sugar’s president and chief executive officer, Mike Walton, said, “The profitable growth we are generating in both our business segments showcases the combined benefits of strong demand for our products.” He added that Rogers Sugar will focus on harnessing this demand. The OAS clawback is a hated tax measure in Canada. If you’re retiring soon, the minimum income threshold for income year 2024 is $90,997. The recovery tax kicks in if your income exceeds the threshold.",

        "content": "ANTHONY MARTIAL BADE an emotional farewell to Manchester United after confirming his nine-year stay at Old Trafford was over. The 28-year-old France international joined the club in a £36million move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on his official Instagram account, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. “Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me. “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my nine years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. “Thank you again for everything and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",
