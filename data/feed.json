        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Cross River State Governor, Senator Bassey Edet Otu, has assured children in the state of his administration’s commitment to develop and drive policies and programs that will nurture and guide them. In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa trade exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration,” says Zoryana Slater. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options. Participation in FAB West Africa presents a prime opportunity to elevate the visibility and reputation of Linc Drinks in the African market.”",

        "content": "Henkel Nigeria, a leading German multinational renowned for its WAW and Nittol detergents in the country, has reaffirmed its dedicated commitment to supporting Nigeria’s industrial development. This commitment comes amidst growing awareness of the potential of Nigeria’s non-oil industry to diversify the economy. This was the focus of discussion during the courtesy visit on Honourable Minister, Dr. Doris Nkiruka Uzoka-Anite, Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment in Abuja, by the Henkel Nigeria management team, led by Rajat Kapur, Managing Director, Henkel Nigeria, along with Kadir Demirtas, Head of Finance, and other key members of the management team. They met with the minister with the aim of strengthening collaboration and identifying strategies to overcome challenges hindering mutual growth and development within Nigeria’s industrial sector. During the visit, Rajat Kapur informed the Minister of the company’s efforts in driving safety and innovation, promoting Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG), and contributing to the nation’s industrial advancement. Acknowledging the ministry’s crucial role in Nigeria’s industrial promotion, Rajat Kapur highlighted Henkel Nigeria’s eagerness to work closely with the government in overcoming challenges to industrial advancement. He also emphasized the critical need to cultivate an enabling business environment in the country, with a particular focus on facilitating access to forex and ensuring stable energy supply. Kapur highlighted the necessity for policy regulations that would provide relief to manufacturers in the nation, emphasizing this as a prerequisite for bolstering economic growth and sustainability. Rajat expressed gratitude, stating, “We commend your unwavering commitment to upholding standards in manufacturing processes that meet global benchmarks. We are working closely with the government to maintain compliance with regulations and align with government initiatives to propel the economy forward.” He added: “We recognize the private sector’s vital role in national development, aligning perfectly with the Federal Government’s vision for economic prosperity. We are also mindful of the fact that fostering innovation, securing jobs, and engaging in sustainable business practices are significant steps in contributing to Nigeria’s growth.” In her response, the Minister commended Henkel Nigeria for its contributions to the country’s economy and welcomed the opportunity to strengthen ties with the company. Acknowledging Henkel’s reputation for excellence and its track record of innovation and empowerment, the Minister expressed optimism about the potential for fruitful collaboration between the Ministry and Henkel Nigeria in overcoming current economic challenges. “We are fully prepared to ensure that your company, along with others operating in the country, receives the appropriate position within the economy, ” she said.",

        "description": "The special counsel is seeking to prevent Trump from making further incendiary remarks about the FBI agents involved in the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
        "content": "Special counsel is preparing legal action if a Donald Trump-appointed judge refuses to rein in the former president's comments, a former prosecutor has said. Trump has repeatedly said that the FBI was willing to use legal force while searching his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. Smith filed a motion to Judge on May 24 seeking an alteration to Trump's bail conditions, in which he would be restrained from making dangerous and untrue comments about the FBI. Smith was appointed special counsel supervising Trump's federal indictments. sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday. Former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance wrote in her legal blog, , on Sunday that Smith decided not to apply for a gag order because he knows that it would be easier to appeal if Cannon refuses his request to adjust Trump's bail conditions. \"Why did Smith go this route instead of asking for a gag order? That's a great question, and I think it suggests where Smith is headed,\" wrote Vance, who served as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama during the Obama administration. She said the relevant federal law \"specifically authorizes the government to appeal if a district judge denies a motion to modify the conditions of release.\" \"That's what this is all about. Donald Trump isn't the only one who can take an appeal for strategic reasons. Judge Cannon has had real trouble ruling for the government in routine motions that clearly merited that treatment. If she rules against them here, they'll be prepared to take a quick appeal,\" Vance wrote. Cannon is a U.S. district judge based in Florida and was appointed by Trump in 2020. She is now presiding over the DOJ's case against the former president. He is and then obstructing the government's efforts to retrieve them. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Cannon has faced criticism and calls to recuse herself from the case for making a the former president. Vance said \"the more pressing question\" is what Smith will do if Cannon deliberately doesn't move on his request—\"if she sits on the motion, as she has on so many others in this case, without ruling or even scheduling a hearing.\" \"Smith will likely be politely persistent at first, asking her to schedule the hearing,\" she wrote. If that doesn't work, Smith will likely seek a writ of mandamus to the appeal court, Vance believes. \"Mandamus asks an appellate court to order a trial judge to do something they are obligated to do but won't or to refrain from doing something they are not permitted to do,\" she explained. The search warrant used in the 2022 raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence was recently in Florida. The raid led to the seizure of hundreds of documents containing classified information, which resulted in dozens of felony counts against the former president. The former president posted on his Truth Social account, alleging that the DOJ \"AUTHORIZED THE TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\" In addition, a Trump campaign email that was recently sent to supporters said that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" Trump, saying President was \"locked & loaded and ready to take me [Trump] out.\" However, the FBI said in a statement that the wording of the warrant was standard and the phrase \"deadly force\" was also included when agents . \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the agency's statement said. Discussing Trump's claim about the search warrant, U.S. Attorney General said at a news conference on Thursday that the \"allegation is false and it is extremely dangerous,\" reiterating that the document in question is standard policy. Smith's filing to Cannon on Friday included 12 pages of Trump's online about the FBI deadly force claim, along with another from X account PatriotTakes, which describes itself, in part, as \"researchers monitoring and exposing right-wing extremism.\" The latter said former adviser had claimed that \"the Mar-a-Lago FBI classified document search was 'an attempted assassination' by Joen Biden on Trump and his associates.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Pirates booked their spot in the CAF Champions League on the final league game after a 1-1 draw against SuperSport United was enough to see them edge Stellenbosch for the second spot on the standings on a superior goal difference. Despite the achievement, Riveiro said in his post-match press conference, that they will not be celebrating finishing second, with full understanding that finishing 23 points behind number one, Sundowns, is not good enough for the Soweto giants. \"I think we shouldn't undermine what it means to be in the Champions League but (we're) not celebrating being second, we're celebrating to be in the Champions League, we've got the right to be there and it's something very important for the club,\" Riveiro told journalists at Orlando Stadium. \"But being second, 23 points behind the first one is not a huge achievement. So that's our objective from now, how can we reduce that gap with whoever is there leading the log. It's too much distance between the second and second position. \"Even though we're fighting with the team that is not famous for dropping points frequently, the things that we can control, the things in our hands like last two games, having the possibility to consolidate the second spot and giving away the points that we gave, it's something we need to do a reflection,\" he said. \"To understand why, because it's our responsibility and like I said, celebrate the Champions League spot but obviously not celebrating that we're second, 23 points away from the first,\" the Spanish coach added. Last season Pirates also finished second, 16 points behind the Tshwane giants. The Brazilians and the Buccaneers will meet in the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday afternoon at Mbombela Stadium.",

She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set.

Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months.",

        "content": "THE Supreme Court has directed the Commission on Elections and joint venture led by South Korea’s Miru Systems Co. Ltd. to comment on the petition seeking to enjoin the implementation of their P17.9-billion Automated Election System (AES) contract for the 2025 national and local elections. The Court gave the respondents 10 days from receipt of notice to file their respective comment on the petition and application for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction filed by former Caloocan Representative Edgar Erice last April 18, according to a statement released by the SC Public Information Office. Erice’s petition primarily seeks to stop the poll body from implementing its February 21, 2024 resolution awarding the Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count (FASTrAC) contract to Miru and its partners St. Timothy Construction Corp. and Centerpoint Solutions Technologies. The former solon also ultimately prayed that the contract between the Comelec and Miru be declared null and void, and that the implementation of any other contract that the poll body may have entered into with the Korean firm, in connection with the incoming elections, be nullified. The petitioner argued that the deal violated the provisions of Republic Act (RA) 7369 or the Automated Election Law, particularly on the bidding procedures and the use of prototype machines during the election process. He claimed that the contract is highly disadvantageous to the government as it stands to lose around P10 billion in taxpayers money. Erice’s petition comes on the heels of the Court’s ruling in April which reversed the Comelec’s decision to disqualify Smartmatic-TIM Corporation from participating in the bidding process for the subject contract. Despite its decision favoring Smartmatic’s petition, the SC did not nullify the P17.9-billion contract that the Comelec inked with Miru. SC spokesman, lawyer Camille Sue Mae Ting, clarified that the validity of Miru’s contract with Comelec was not the issue presented in the case before the SC. She added the Court’s ruling was not tantamount to upholding Comelec’s contract with MIRU since it was not the issue decided upon by the magistrates.",

        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane , and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Colleen Barry in Rome contributed to this report.

        "description": "Health Department is keen on enabling more government hospitals to perform liver transplants, and has been encouraging them to have tie-ups with well-established hospitals and receive training for the procedure",
        "content": "In a span of 15 months, the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) has performed 11 cadaveric liver transplants. With the deceased donor liver transplantation programme steadily progressing in the State’s largest government hospital, the Health Department is keen on enabling more government hospitals to perform cadaveric liver transplants. Health Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi said they were encouraging hospitals such as the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, to perform liver transplants. The Tirunelveli Medical College also has an initial tie-up with a private hospital for the procedure. “We want more and more government medical college hospitals to perform liver transplants so that the poor benefit. We are asking government medical colleges, particularly the departments of surgical gastroenterology and deans, to have tie-ups with well-established hospitals so that cross-learning happens. This way, the experience can be broad-based to other parts of the State and common people will stand to benefit,” he said. It may be recalled that the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital was the first among government hospitals to start performing liver transplants in Tamil Nadu. Cadaveric liver transplants took off at the RGGGH in February 2023. In a nearly 14-hour procedure that started at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday, doctors performed its 11 th liver transplantation in 15 months on a 40-year-old woman who had Wilson’s disease. E. Theranirajan, Dean of RGGGH, said eight cadaveric liver transplants were performed last year and three so far this year. “This time, our team retrieved the liver independently from the donor. As per the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the State government and Rela Hospital (2022 to 2025), our team had undergone training in liver transplantation. We had put in place appropriate infrastructure to take forward liver transplantation in the institution. Our aim is to operate independently, and in the near future, start pancreatic and small intestine transplantations,” he said. RGGGH has recorded 18 donors so far this year, while 26 kidney transplants were also done. K. Prem Kumar, Director In-charge of Institute of Hepatobiliary Sciences, RGGGH, said that training was a continuous process. “Before we started performing transplants, our doctors, staff nurses, and paramedical staff, such as those from microbiology and biochemistry departments, underwent extensive training,” he said. Liver transplants require teamwork and coordination, and this has been put in place at the institute, C. Sugumar, Director, Institute of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant, RGGGH, added. “We have the required infrastructure. We have WhatsApp groups with other departments pertaining to liver transplant as well as with the Rela Hospital team. Once an alert on brain death identification comes in, we take up all required measures, including asking the priority list of patients to come in for re-evaluations,” he said. Post-transplant, doctors meet every day to discuss the patient’s condition and treatment protocols. Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "description": "As politics and elections and the volatility associated with it take centre stage in the world this year, investors have to keep a cool head.",
        "content": "In 2024, more than 20% of the world’s population will go to the polls as over 40 major elections will be held, including South Africa’s own national elections happening this week. “Politics has become a significant source of volatility in financial markets, more than in the past,” Kondi Nkosi, country head in South Africa for global investment manager, Schroders, says. “It has become increasingly important for investors to be conscious of the political backdrop when making investment decisions. After all, government policy changes can have a profound effect on a company’s future profitability.” ALSO READ: Elections 2024: investors keeping their options open This is not to say that investors should try to predict the future, he says. “There have been a number of elections in recent years which resulted in surprising outcomes and therefore it is best for investors to focus on long-term investments they believe can ride out political storms and news flow.” What are the implications for investing in a time of political change? “Politics can create short term noise. Although the market likes to focus on events like elections, political trends tend to play out over months and years. But if you can withstand the volatility, it is best to sit on your hands and wait for it to pass,” Johanna Kyrklund, group chief Investment officer says. Bank any profits before the election “If you really have to trade, then it may be wise to bank any profits before an election. But investors should always avoid knee jerk reactions when results come out.” Alex Tedder, co-head of equities, says short-term market setbacks, like those created by political uncertainty, can prove very helpful for more patient investors looking to generate returns. “Over the long term, we still feel that this is a bigger determinant of investor returns than trying to respond to political events.” ALSO READ: Multi-Party Charter winning election a long shot, could lead to unrest Alex Monk, portfolio manager for global resource equities, says the US election in November 2024 will be most important for energy transition equities, given the risks to Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) support in a strong Republican win. “Although support to energy transition sectors is unlikely to be removed in its entirety, the leading runners for the Republican nomination have talked about repealing aspects of the policy, making the risk of a reduction in support a credible threat. “Regardless of the ultimate outcome, we would at least expect those names that currently benefit most from the policy to experience volatility as the election looms. Outside of the US, major elections in Taiwan, India, Mexico, South Africa, the UK and Belgium must all be watched.” Politics important for many investors Simon Adler, fund manager for the global value team, says they understand that politics can be an important consideration for many investors. “After all, the political instability in countries in, say, Africa and South America, can be disconcerting, especially when they lead to industrial unrest, strikes in key sectors such as power, the imposition of emergency measures and so on.” He says while Schroders is mindful of the possible impact of political events, it avoids buying into any prevailing opinions or other ‘noise’ that could influence portfolio decisions. “On the global value team, we believe an unemotional, valuation-based approach to investing should deliver over the long-run regardless of politics and indeed we can point to more than 100 years of history that backs this up.“ Duncan Lamont, head of strategic research points out that stock markets often fall in the near-term when geopolitical risk spikes, as markets re-assess risk. “Past performance is not a guide to the future and every situation is different but, historically, they have started to recover strongly within a matter of months. Staying the course rather than reacting rashly has worked out for the best.” ALSO READ: ANC/DA coalition: better politically/economically; risk of unrest higher It is about the destination, not the journey, he says. “We have no way of knowing yet whether Trump will seize power again in the US, or whether we may see various iterations of coalitions in South Africa and what these may look like. More important is the direction of political travel and how it could impact investment prospects either locally or abroad.” Nkosi adds that while the political outlook may be getting more complicated, a resilient long-term investment strategy that can withstand political shocks is likely to help investors navigate what lies ahead. Investors must be careful in election market sentiment Roger Eskinazi, managing partner at Tickmill says traders are advised to take caution amid upcoming elections market sentiment. “As we find ourselves in the thick of election season, traders and investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and avoid making rash decisions based on emotional biases given the uncertainty of the outcome of the national election taking place this week.” He remembers five years ago, South Africa experienced a phenomenon known as “Ramaphoria”, following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s narrow victory. “Initially, domestic equities and the South African rand rallied strongly. However, within just two months, the rand weakened by 8% and banks and insurers saw declines of more than 10% following the administration’s announcement.” Similarly, irrational market behaviour was observed during these significant political events, he says: Nenegate (2015): The dismissal of finance minister Nhlanhla Nene resulted in a temporary rand volatility Zuma unrest (2021): Despite the initial turmoil, the rand remained relatively stable amid the chaos. Eskinazi says recent strength in the rand can be largely attributed to a weaker US dollar and cautious optimism regarding the election outcome. “Market sentiment suggests a possible scenario where the ruling party may lose some ground, but not enough to result in a destabilising coalition. “Should the election result in a favourable outcome, it is likely that the rand will strengthen and banks, insurers and domestically sensitive stocks will outperform.” He says in this sensitive period traders are advised to align their trades with thorough valuation assessments and consider their time horizons and remain aware of exogenous events that could trigger irrational emotional responses.",

        "description": "Trinamool Congress to skip event due to final phase of election.",
        "content": "Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has called a meeting of the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) in Delhi on June 1 to assess their performance in the ongoing elections and chalk out a strategy ahead of the results on June 4. The Trinamool Congress has expressed its inability to attend the meeting due to the last phase of polling. Also read | INDIA and the hurdle of convincing the voter “It is an informal discussion. During the elections, we have not met. We have only been coordinating over the phone. And contrary to everyone’s initial expectations, the INDIA bloc has performed very well across the country. The meeting is to assess our electoral performance and to chart the way ahead,” a top Congress leader said. There is no conversation yet on formulating a common minimum programme, though the INDIA bloc leaders appear optimistic about the poll outcome. The INDIA bloc was constituted in March 2023 in Patna and since then it has suffered multiple setbacks, including losing founding members such as the Janata Dal(U) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal. The allies have also fought against each other in at least three States — the Congress against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab; the Congress against the Left parties in Kerala , and the Trinamool Congress against the Congress-Left combine in West Bengal. The various committees and sub-committees constituted for campaigning and publicity also failed to function during the election. However, the allies believe that they have good coordination particularly in Uttar Pradesh that sends the highest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha. The Trinamool Congress said it will not take part in the meeting as nine seats in West Bengal would be going to the polls on June 1. The party had won all nine seats in 2019. “Nothing much should be read into our absence. We are defending nine seats that vote on June 1. It will be impossible for us to go. And in all INDIA bloc meetings only three of our top leaders have participated, so we can not really depute any junior member,” a Trinamool leader said. The two prominent allies have run a bitter campaign against each other in the election. However, after some strong statements against the Opposition bloc, the Trinamool has softened its stance and insists that while an electoral understanding could not be achieved, the party remains with the INDIA bloc at the national level. Senior Congress leaders said initially they were planning to schedule the meeting on June 2 or 3, but could not do so because of the commitments of various leaders.

He believes there is more to her death than suicide and has accused her boyfriend, Ryan, of blackmailing and emotionally traumatising her. According to Oladipo, Ryan infected Alanis with Herpes, which she saw as a stigma and kept secret. “Ryan used this information to blackmail her, broke into her phone, and stole sensitive information,” he alleged. Oladipo claims that Ryan’s actions pushed Alanis into depression and trauma. He also alleges that Ryan lied to the police in his witness statement and that the investigation has been mishandled. Oladipo, however, called on the UK authorities to conduct a thorough investigation into his daughter’s death while seeking the assistance of the Nigerian High Commission in the UK.",

        "description": "Saundra Glenn has mobility issues and was struggling to walk into Radio 1’s Big Weekend until Martin pulled up in a car to help.",
        "content": "Saundra Glenn told the PA news agency she was close to giving up and going home after struggling to walk to the accessibility box office at the entrance of the festival, which took place in her hometown Luton this weekend. With osteoarthritis and problems in her hip, knee and ankle, the 64-year-old was resting against a fence when a black Mercedes people carrier pulled up next to her and a woman in the front seat told her she could hop in. “The back door glided back and Chris Martin was in the backseat,” said Ms Glenn, a local community advocate. “I looked at him and said (to the woman in the passenger seat) ‘I can’t get in, that’s Chris Martin’. “He goes: ‘Yes you can, just come on in’.” Ms Glenn was then driven into the festival alongside Martin, who talked with her about “all kinds of things” including her work in the local community in Luton. “He said ‘It’s lovely to hear about what you do’,” Ms Glenn said. “I said I’m 65 this summer, he said ‘You don’t look it’ and not to worry about age and just to keep doing what I’m doing. “He seems like a totally decent human being and I told him that... I said ‘You’re just a very nice person’.” Ms Glenn took several selfies with Martin, who even offered her a hint about a secret he had planned for his set that evening. Coldplay played a new song called Orange during their set in tribute to Luton Town FC after a public campaign by fans, so the band played a new song celebrating the local club. “He told me he’s going to do something special at the end – I said ‘Go on are you changing yellow to orange?'” said Ms Glenn. “He said, I can’t tell you that, but I can say, wait ’til the end – I’m doing something special, and that was special.” Martin had to jump out of the vehicle before Ms Glenn, but when he got to his destination he told staff to get into a buggy with her and escort her all the way to her destination at the festival’s accessible area. “They didn’t leave me until I had my wristband on – that’s how dedicated they were,” Ms Glenn said. “I got onto the stage area where you can sit and I saw Chris’s set – it was a fantastic experience last night, it’s the best thing I’ve done in a long, long time.” “He’s shown that kindness rules the world. “Be more Chris Martin – be more that humble guy that doesn’t mind picking up an OAP – albeit a good-looking, young-looking OAP – and giving her a ride to help her out.”",

        "description": "OVER 4,000 megawatts (MW) power generating capacity was shaved off from the Luzon grid, owing to a number of power plants that are on outage and running on derated capacities.",
        "content": "OVER 4,000 megawatts (MW) power generating capacity was shaved off from the Luzon grid, owing to a number of power plants that are on outage and running on derated capacities. On Monday, the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) placed the Luzon grid on red alert from 1pm to 4pm and from 6pm to 10pm. A red alert status is issued when power supply is insufficient to meet consumer demand and the transmission grid’s regulating requirement. From 12noon to 1pm, 5pm to 6pm, and 10pm to 12 midnight, the grid is on yellow alert, which means that the operating margin is insufficient to meet the transmission grid’s contingency requirement. According to the NGCP, Luzon’s available capacity reached 11,810MW as against a peak demand of 11,785MW. The grid operator said three power plants have been on forced outage since 2023, two between January and March 2024, and 15 power plants between April and May 2024; while three are running on derated capacities, for a total of 4,497.3 MW unavailable to the grid. It also cited several factors that contributed to the raising of red and yellow alerts. These include the forced outage of Ilijan (600MW), Pagbilao 1 (382MW) & 3 (420MW), and San Buenaventura Power Ltd. (SBPL) (455MW) due to typhoon Aghon; forced outage of Masinloc 3 (335MW) due to boiler feed water trouble; forced outage of Quezon Power Philippines, Ltd. PPL (460MW) due to broken spring support of turbine combine reheat valve; and deration of Sual 1, Calaca 2, Masinloc 1. The Visayas and Mindanao grids, meanwhile, are in normal condition. The NGCP said it may implement Manual Load Dropping (MLD) in some parts of Batangas to maintain the integrity of the power system. In an online news conference, the Department of Energy (DOE) said 34 power plants are offline, 23 of which are within the grid while 11 are in various off-grid areas. Nine of the 23 plants are on shutdown due to Typhoon Aghon. “Typhoon Aghon has caused a substantial decrease in available power supply in the grid at a time when the hydro power plants have not yet recovered from their low water supply. While the power supply is expected to improve in the coming days, the DOE encourages everyone to conserve energy in order to minimize dispatch of the more expensive oil-based power plants,” the agency said. Based on DOE records, the total capacity on forced outage is 4,281.3MW while deration amounts to 216 MW. Since Typhoon Aghon entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) last May 25, the 1,200 MW Ilijan power plant was on shutdown as its Floating Storage Unit (FSU) had to be disconnected and relocated for safety reasons. Last May 26, Pagbilao Units 1 and 2 with a total capacity of 764 MW and Unit 3 with a capacity of 420 MW went on shutdown due to Typhoon Aghon. Masinloc 3 with a capacity of 335 MW, SBPL with a capacity of 455 MW and Botocan with a capacity of 20.8 MW also went on outage due to the typhoon. In addition, Kalayaan Unit 4 with a capacity of 180 MW tripped on Monday morning. Currently, the Ilijan/Linseed FSU is undergoing berthing and attachment. Securing the berthing and attachment of loading arms will take around two to three hours, after which the regasification will resume. But due to Ilijan’s shutdown, it will have to undergo 14 to 16 hours of cold start before it can resume full normal operations. Meanwhile, restoration work is currently ongoing for the lines to the Pagbilao plants and other affected plants. The Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) of First Gas continues to supply the grid despite the typhoon, the DOE said. Meanwhile, several hydro power plants are derated, having been affected adversely by another natural disaster, the El Niño that brought drought in addition to extreme high temperatures. On various dates throughout April and May 2024, seven hydroelectric power plants with a total capacity of 440 MW went on forced outage due to low water level. In addition, four fossil-fueled power plants with a total capacity of 916 MW have been on forced outage due to technical problems aggravated by extreme heat indices. Four other hydroelectric power plants and two biomass power plants with a total capacity of 34.7 MW have been offline since August 2023 due to insufficient water level and lack of feedstock, respectively. Another 15.8 MW biomass power plant was on forced outage since May 18 due to lack of feedstock. According to DOE Undersecretary Rowena Guevara, red alerts could still be hoisted over the Luzon grid next week if these power plants remain on shutdown or would still fail to deliver their full capacity. “If these plants will not come back on line next week then probably we will have red alerts next week,” the DOE official warned. During red alerts, the operation of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) is suspended. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on Monday afternoon ordered the suspension due to insufficient generation capacity in the grid. Following the suspension, the ERC has directed the Independent Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) and the NGCP to operate the market. “The operations of the WESM shall remain suspended until issuance of a Notice of Market Resumption by the ERC,” the ERC said,adding that it is closely monitoring developments in the country’s power situation to ensure the reliability and security of the power system, and maintain continuous operations of the generators.",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico's southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions that were imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The IAEA report comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have also carried out direct strikes on each other’s territories for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the International Atomic Energy Agency's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "It’s not uncommon for 20-somethings to win the Iron Horse Bicycle Classic. Just look at names like Kira Payer and Riley Amos. Saturday’s road race winners – Lauren Aggeler and Cobe Freeburn – are no strangers to those who pay attention to Durango cycling either, but their top spots on the podium are capstones of both their Iron Horse careers so far. Both riders have been training and racing with the Durango Devo program from childhood, with Freeburn going on to race numerous disciplines with the Fort Lewis College Cycling team. In 2022, Aggeler won two collegiate mountain bike national titles for Northern Arizona University on home courses at Purgatory Resort. Both riders have earned impressive results, but winning the Iron Horse puts them in special company of Durango cycling royalty. Sepp Kuss won in 2017, just before he broke through into the professional ranks of the World Tour. Sarah Sturm’s 2019 victory took place just before the FLC alumnae was making inroads in the endurance off-road cycling scene. Kuss and Sturm are now household names, and Aggeler and Freeburn are not far behind. Aggeler circles globe on World Cup circuit When 20-year-old Aggeler isn’t in Durango, she’s competing around the globe in the mountain bike World Cup, the world’s most prestigious mountain bike series. After spending time on both the Bear National Team and Durango’s Segment 28, Aggeler signed to Trinity Racing in 2023. The U.K.-based team has both road and mountain bike squads and has graduated riders into the very top ranks of the sport. At the World Cup, Aggeler competes in the Under-23 category, designed for young riders to prepare for the elite category. She began her season this year in Puerto Rico, earning a trio of fifth-place finishes across four races. Then the World Cup series began with a duo of races in Brazil, where Aggeler’s best result was 18th place in a short track race. After placing ninth in the Continental Championships in Utah, Aggeler claimed second place at a national-level elite race in Wisconsin – not a bad spring campaign to warm up for the Iron Horse. Aggeler plans to head to Europe to rejoin the World Cup in a couple of weeks. Freeburn shows off-road prowess The 22-year-old Freeburn earned top results in his junior and collegiate career with FLC Cycling. Last year, his top result was a fifth place at the U.S. Pro Cup race in Arkansas, and he also completed three World Cup races in Europe Later in the year, he raced the inaugural Gravel National Championships and also placed 17th in Trinidad, Colorado’s The Rad Dirt Fest gravel race. Once again racing for Bear National Team, Freeburn’s 2024 calendar has included additional gravel races, a discipline that has risen in popularity domestically and abroad in recent years. Earlier this year, he placed eighth at the well-known Belgian Waffle Ride’s Utah stop and then rode to a career-best second place at a UCI Gravel World Series race in Arkansas. One doesn’t have to look far down the results sheet to identify additional young talent. Third-place Michaela Thompson (age 21) also won Sunday’s gravel race and this year is competing in the invite-only Life Time Grand Prix series. Third place in the men’s road race went to 17-year-old Emmett McManus of Segment 28 who won his first-ever UCI-level race in Utah last week. Durango can’t wait to see what else these athletes get up to this summer.",

        "content": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "A moving tribute was paid to a teenage boy a year after he died at a Welsh music festival. Schoolboy Rhys Murray from Port Talbot died at the In It Together festival in Margam following an asthma attack in May 2023. In an emotional interview following his death the 16-year-old Ysgol Cwm Brombil pupil was described by his older brother Thomas as being a \"wonderful boy and a ball of charisma\". Speaking to WalesOnline last year he said: \"Rhys was my absolute world, he was my rock and everything someone could mean to someone. \"He was absolutely adored and worshipped by his family. He absolutely loved musical theatre and performing on stage. He was very big into his drama and music in general. He loved his boxing too.\" READ MORE: The unusual reason you might have a headache or joint pain right now READ MORE: Furious families protest outside prison after deaths One year on from the tragedy Rhys was honoured in an emotional tribute during the festival. It came as organisers teamed up with charity Asthma + Lung UK Cymru in Rhys' memory and to help educate people about the condition. For the latest Neath Port Talbot news, sign up to our newsletter here The event - where the likes of Sugababes, Dizzee Rascal, Sam Ryder and Craig David performed over the weekend - saw crowds stop what they were doing to pay their respects in a \"lovely moment\". A festivalgoer told WalesOnline: \"At around 8pm on Sunday a series of photos of the young lad played on the screen on the main Parc Stage while the host led everyone in a one minute round of applause in his memory. Everyone stopped what they were doing and took a moment to pay respect and applaud. It was a lovely moment.\" Posters were also placed around this year's festival to show what steps should be taken when someone has an asthma attack, including when to call 999. A video where a specialist nurse explained what to do was shown on the main stage screen. According to Asthma + Lung UK Cymru you should follow the following steps if you think you are experiencing an asthma attack:",

        "content": "The Ilorin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC on Wednesday, May 22, 2024 arraigned two persons for offences bordering on possession of solid minerals without lawful authority. They are Nura Lawal and Tunde Jimoh. The defendants were arraigned on one-count charge before Justice Uche Agomoh of the Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State. While Lawal was the driver of a truck allegedly conveying about 30 tons of assorted , Jimoh was the escort of the truck. Their journey to the dock started when the Ilorin Command of the EFCC received intelligence about the activities of some people who were engaged in mining of solid minerals within Kwara and transporting same outside for commercial purposes without lawful authority. The Commission swung into action and eventually arrested the two defendants on February 4, 2024 in Ogbomosho area of Oyo State. The charge against the defendants reads: “That you, Nura Lawal and Tunde Jimoh sometime in February 2024 within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court, without lawful authority were found in possession of minerals conveyed in a truck with plate number T3815LA contrary to, and punishable under Section 1 (8) (b) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act Cap M17, 1983” Lawal pleaded guilty to the charge read in English Language and interpreted to him in Hausa Language, while Jimoh pleaded not guilty to the charge. Following the pleas by the defendants, counsel to the EFCC, Mustapha Kaigama, urged the court to fix a date for review facts in the case of Lawal that pleaded guilty and trial in the case of the second defendant (Jimoh) that pleaded not guilty to the charge. There was no objection to the prosecution’s prayer by Lawal’s counsel, C. I Ipinsokan. However, Jimoh’s counsel, Michael Adetayo urged the court to fix an early date to enable him move the bail application of his client, while praying the court to allow the defendant to continue on the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission. Justice Agomoh after listening to the parties, refused the prayer by Jimoh’s counsel, saying, “the proper place to keep an inmate under the law is the Nigerian Correctional Centre.” He also said, “the court cannot give a date to hear and determine a bail application that is yet to be filed before it.” The judge thereafter ordered that the defendants be remanded at Nigerian Correctional Centre, Agodi, Ibadan and adjourned till June 5, 2024 for review of facts in Lawal’s case and trial in the case of Jimoh.",

        "content": "Tis Hazari court on Monday dismissed the bail application of Bibhav Kumar, who is the former aide of the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal bail application. He has been arrested in the Rajya Sabha MP Swati Maliwal assault case. He is to be produced before the court tomorrow after the expiry of 4 days of judicial custody. Additional Sessions Judge Sushil Anuj Tyagi dismissed the bail application after hearing submissions by senior advocate N Hariharan for the accused, additional public prosecutor Atul Srivastava and advocate Madhav Khurana, counsel for Swati Maliwal. The court had reserved the order on the day after hearing lengthy arguments on the bail plea of Bibhav Kumar, accused in the Swati Maliwal assault case. Swati Maliwal, who was presented in the hearing, opposed the bail plea saying she was receiving threats. She broke down in tears during the hearing. At the outset, Delhi Police opposed the bail application by saying that it was not filed in an appropriate court. Senior advocate N Hariharan submitted that this bail application is maintainable. This is the right court that has jurisdiction to hear the bail application. In this FIR section 308 IPC has been invoked which is triable by the sessions court. Advocate Hariharan argued that the complainant went to CM’s residence and called PA Bibhav Kumar. PA Bibhav Kumar was not present at the CM’s house, after which she headed towards the CM’s residence without any permission or prior appointment. “Can anyone enter in this manner, this is the official residence of CM,” Senior Advocate Hariharan argued. “There was a trespass and a report was also filed. She had no appointment for a meeting, and there was no message of her arrival,” he further argued. He further submitted that she was stopped by the security staff after which she asked them “You will make an MP wait,” the senior Advocate referred to the report. “Maliwal sat in the waiting room and asked security to talk to Bibhav Kumar,” the senior defence counsel said. Senior counsel argued, “What she is stating in the FIR, that is not true.” “This FIR is not the result of contemporaneous complaint. FIR was lodged after three days,” the senior Advocate argued. “Kindly look at the place where the alleged incident took place where many people were present. How can such an incident take place at this place,” N Hariharan submitted. “There are many hospitals in the area, but she was taken to AIIMS for medical. There is no grievous injury on the vital part, so where is the question of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” the Advocate argued. Defence counsel N Hariharan further argued that the injuries can be self-inflicted. “The allegations do not make out a case of intention to disrobe her,” the senior Advocate argued. At this point, Swati Maliwal broke down in tears when the defence counsel was arguing. “This entire FIR is the result of afterthought. I am seeking bail only, not the acquittal,” the senior advocate argued. He submitted that CCTV footage has already been recovered, so there is no question of tampering. “My (Bibhav) availability to police investigation is from the very beginning, he argued, adding that everything was pre-planned and tailor-made to suit her story,” Advocate Hariharan argued. Senior Advocate further submitted that it was an overreach by the prosecution preventing this court from passing an order on anticipatory bail. “They informed about the arrest when the court was dictating the order, he added. He has been in custody since May 18,” the senior Advocate concluded his arguments. Additional Public Prosecutor(APP) Atul Srivastava opposed the bail application and submitted that intention is not required to make out a case of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder, knowledge is sufficient. “The accused had beaten a lady, alone dragged her and her head hit the centre table, will this not cause death,” APP argued. “If I slap a lady in an open place, it is outraging the modesty of a woman,” the APP argued. Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the submissions of defence counsel that she went there with a premeditated mind to malign Bibhav Kumar. Her reputation was kept in high esteem by the party chief and was called Lady Singham, the APP submitted. “The accused was terminated from his post. The accused did not tell the complainant that I was not in service and couldn’t arrange the meeting with the CM. It shows the intention on the part of the accused,” APP submitted. APP submitted that there was no occasion earlier when she was asked to take a prior appointment. “Why did the security officer not make a call to PCR,” APP argued. “She was allowed to sit in the waiting room. It was implied permission, where is the question of trespass, APP submitted. When Bibhav Kumar reached there, he asked who allowed her to go inside,” he added. “All the people at the place of occurrence were reporting to Bibhav Kumar. It shows that he is influential. He can tamper with the evidence,” APP argued. Section 308 (Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder) IPC is made out against the accused, the APP submitted. He added that the complainant was taken to AIIMS as she was residing at CR Park, APP argued. “She was not maligning the accused,” he added. On the point of delay in FIR, the APP submitted that the complainant did not disclose the entire incident to the police. Even thereafter, a police officer visited the place of the incident. “In India, women are very reluctant to report the sexual offences,” APP argued. The CCTV footage may be missing due to some technical reasons, the APP submitted. The court asked, “Why are the police looking into the phone of the accused? APP said that there may be some crucial evidence. iPhone was handed over after formatting, it is tampering, the APP submitted. “The accused went to Mumbai to format his phone. He admitted that he had formatted his phone and the password was not given. We may ask for further police custody. I strongly opposed the bail application,” APP submitted. Senior Advocate N Hariharan opposed and said the counsel for the complainant couldn’t address the court. The court Advocate Madhav Khurana argued and he referred to judgement whether he can address the court or not. He submitted that the victim has the right to be heard. The bail application can’t be heard without issuing a notice to the victim, Khurana argued. Swati Maliwal was also standing with her counsel before the judge. He submitted that Maliwal said that she was going inside and, you could call the police. But the police were not called. As per the MLC, the injuries were there even after four days, which shows the magnitude, Khurana argued. Three-four days delay is inconsequential in these cases, her Advocate added. The accused sent a complaint through email on May 17, Advocate Khurana submitted. “The accused was found at the place of occurrence, he was interrogated but was evasive in answering,” Advocate Khurana said. He also submitted that the accused allegedly assaulted a public servant earlier. “If the accused is innocent, then why format his phone, tempered the CCTV, and file a complaint on May 17,” Advocate Khurana said. “The complainant is receiving rape and murder threats. The triple test was not satisfied in this case advocate,” Khurana argued. Swati Maliwal also addressed the court. She said after recording her statement, AAP leaders organised a press conference. “I was called a BJP agent”. “They have a huge troll machinery, they have pumped the machinery, she said while adding that the accused was taken to Mumbai and Lucknow by the leaders of the party. “If this accused is released on bail there would be a threat to me and my family,” Maliwal told the court. She said that the accused is not an ordinary man, he is getting the facilities used by the ministers, Maliwal said. Senior Advocate M Hariharan rebutted and submitted that there are no ingredients to make out the offence of Culpable homicide not amounting to murder",

        "content": "Angela Levin discusses Harry and Meghan in Nigeria Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were warned that their \"faux royal tours\" abroad could \"deepen\" the ongoing rift with the Royal Family. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was described by many as a \"successful\" three-day trip to Nigeria earlier this month to promote mental health for soldiers and empower young people. And they also hinted that there could be more tours on the horizon after Harry told PEOPLE that it's \"hugely important for us to meet directly with people, supporting our causes and listening, in order to bring about solutions, support and positive change.\" But now a PR expert has claimed trips of this nature could have an impact on the Montecito couple's already strained relationship with the Royal Family. PR specialist Lynn Carratt from Press Box PR told the Mirror : \"These faux-royal tours could deepen their rift with the Royal Family, if not handled correctly.

She explained: \"I don’t believe the Nigerian tour helped to increase their popularity in the UK and USA, but it did showcase to the African nations the work that the couple can do and will certainly have increased their popularity there.\" Meanwhile, sources claimed last week Harry and Meghan could be eyeing up Ghana for their next tour.

The funding round was led by Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation with participation from family offices of SRF Group, Krishna Bodanapu of Cyient Technologies and Timmy Sarna from Pure Home + Living. This fund infusion will enable Indya to undertake business expansion of its premium occasion wear range “Weddings By Indya” and chart a growth roadmap in the occasion and wedding wear market, the company said. Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation said, “ Indya’s core strength lies in their unique designs that cater to the Indian as well as global diaspora. Shivani & Anurag have built strong back-end capabilities and this investment will empower them to fuel Indya’s global expansion while allowing them to take a larger share of the vast Indian wedding wear market.” To capitalise on the growing wedding wear segment, Indya has plans to expand its business presence across the country with 10 new wedding stores in this financial year. It currently retails through 12 exclusive brand outlets in 8 cities, and 150 large format retail outlets.

With over 1.5 million customers globally, this business segment has posted a 50% year-on-year growth, the company said. Shivani Poddar and Anurag Murali, co-founders of HSE in a statement said, “ We see an immense opportunity to build a strong presence for Wedding By Indya in the $15 billion wedding wear market, a large part of which is still unorganised.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

        "description": "Russia began its Kharkiv offensive prematurely and with an understrength force to try to make progress before US aid arrived in Ukraine, per the ISW.",
        "content": "Russia began its latest offensive in northern Ukraine too early and without enough soldiers because it wanted to get ahead of Western aid heading to Ukraine, experts said. The Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said over the weekend that \"Russian forces likely launched the offensive operation in northern Kharkiv Oblast earlier than intended with an understrength force hoping to establish a foothold before the arrival of resumed US military aid to the front made that task more difficult.\" Congress voted to resume aid for Ukraine last month, after Republicans stalled for six months. The $61 billion package could have a major impact on the battlefield. Russia started its new offensive in Kharkiv, in northeast Ukraine, earlier this month. The ISW said Russia was seemingly able to surprise Ukraine when it started the offensive, and made some gains in areas that Ukrainian officials said were not as well defended. But, it added, \"the likely premature start of Russian offensive operations appears to have undermined Russian success in northern Kharkiv Oblast.\" Related stories The ISW said that Ukraine has subsequently boosted its defenses, so Russia's forces \"have likely expended their tactical opportunity to make relatively rapid gains against lightly-held positions in this area.\" Ukraine said earlier this month that it had slowed Russia's attack and that Russia had advanced no more than six miles into Ukrainian territory. The ISW said that Russia seems to be trying to bring its Northern Grouping of Forces up to its planned strength before increasing operations in the region. Ukrainian sources said this could mean up to 70,000 men, compared to about 35,000 at the start of the offensive. But the ISW warned the force, even at 70,000, \"will lack the necessary manpower needed to conduct a successful operation to envelop, encircle, or seize Kharkiv City.\" Some US artillery and other military assets have already started to arrive in Ukraine, but other equipment will take longer to reach the front lines. In April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was firing 10 times more artillery than Ukraine, and had 30 times more aircraft. Soldiers in Ukraine told BI that the shortages meant they had to ration ammunition and not go after some of the same types of targets they would have earlier in the war. Russia has tried to take advantage of Ukraine's shortages, such as trying to get it to use up its air defense missiles . Despite the ISW's assessment, the situation is fast-moving and fast-changing, and does not look entirely positive for Ukraine. Ukraine still has a major manpower and resource disadvantage compared to the much larger Russia. On Sunday, Russia said it had taken the village of Berestove in the northeast of Kharkiv, though the claim has not been confirmed. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said on Saturday that Russian forces have had an eight-to-one casualty ratio compared to Ukraine, and the ISW said Ukraine took back some territory near the city of Vovchansk in the region last week.",

        "content": "The Israel Defense Force (IDF) released a map that purports to show the area targeted in an airstrike on Rafah while denouncing for \"lies and misinformation\" regarding the strike. Over 36,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its assault on Gaza following the surprise October 7 attack by Hamas, according to the Associated Press, citing local health authorities. The initial Hamas attack killed approximately 1,200 in Israel, while about 250 hostages were taken. At least 45 people were killed in a Rafah tent camp following the Israeli attack that ignited a massive fire on Sunday night, according to Reuters. The strike prompted global condemnation and calls for the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to enforce its recent ruling demanding that Israel cease its attack on Rafah. The IDF said Monday on X, formerly , that the strike had been \"carried out against legitimate targets under international law, through the use of precise munitions and on the basis of precise intelligence,\" while acknowledging that \"several civilians in the area were harmed\" due to the fire. In a statement emailed to , the IDF said that it had \"encouraged civilians to evacuate\" a \"humanitarian area\" in Rafah while announcing that it was investigating the reported deaths of civilians in the area due to an \"exceptional incident\" having taken place. \"The incident is under the investigation of the General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism, which is an independent body responsible for examining exceptional incidents in combat,\" the statement reads. \"The General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians during combat.\" Last night, the carried out an intelligence-based precise strike that targeted senior Hamas terrorists in Tal as Sultan. Contrary to Hamas' lies and misinformation, the strike did not take place in the Al-Mawasi Humanitarian Area. This is the area where the strike... The IDF posted a map on Monday morning alongside claims that the targeted zone was not part of the Rafah humanitarian area, despite Hamas' claims to the contrary. The IDF asserted that the strike had only targeted \"Hamas terrorists.\" \"Last night, the [Israeli Air Force] carried out an intelligence-based precise strike that targeted senior Hamas terrorists in Tal as Sultan,\" the IDF stated, sharing the map that purports to show the strike zone. \"Contrary to Hamas' lies and misinformation, the strike did not take place in the Al-Mawasi Humanitarian Area, This is the area where the strike actually happened,\" it said. The map shows the targeted area just to the west of the humanitarian area. UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees, accused Israel of launching \"further attacks on families seeking shelter\" on X, calling the Rafah airstrike \"horrifying.\" \"There are reports of mass causalities including children and women among those killed,\" UNRWA . \"Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that.\" reached out for comment to UNRWA via email on Monday. Josep Borrell, the 's top foreign affairs official, also wrote on X that he was \"horrified\" by the Rafah attack and demanded that Israel immediately cease its military operation in Gaza. \"Horrified by news coming out of #Rafah on Israeli strikes killing dozens of displaced persons, including small children,\" Borrell wrote. \"I condemn this in the strongest terms. There is no safe place in Gaza. These attacks must stop immediately. ICJ orders & IHL must be respected by all parties.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "CARDIFF: The third T20I of the four-match series between Pakistan and England, scheduled at Sophia Gardens here is likely to get interrupted by the rain, according to the United Kingdom (UK) Met Office weather forecast. According to the forecast, Cardiff will receive heavy rainfall on Tuesday with the chances as high as 90 per cent. UK Met Office reports a 50 per cent chance of rain early in the morning which is likely to go up by 90 per cent by noon. The rain probability will then significantly drop down to 50 per cent during the match, which is scheduled to commence at 6:30 pm local time. The humidity level is expected to go as high as 94 per cent while the temperature ranges from 13 to 14 degrees Celsius. If the match gets underway, the higher humidity will make it tougher for the bowlers to grip the ball and will also pose a threat for the fielders. Furthermore, such high moisture leads to a damp and unpredictable pitch which may cause additional difficulties for both batters and bowlers. Notably, the first T20I of the four-match series between Pakistan and England was also washed out without a ball bowled while the home side emerged victorious in the second fixture in Birmingham on Saturday. The home side lead the four-match series 1-0 with two games to spare. For the unversed, the four-match T20I series between Pakistan and England, scheduled to run from May 22 to 30, will serve as a warm-up for both teams heading into the T20 World Cup 2024 as the previous edition’s finalists will skip the warm-up matches for this year’s mega event. Pakistan squad: Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Former soccer player Christian Karembeu, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, says two of his relatives have been killed during the unrest in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia that has left seven people dead. Speaking during an interview with Europe 1 radio on Monday, the former Real Madrid midfielder said his two relatives were shot in the head by snipers. “I’ve lost family members, that’s why I’ve kept quiet,\" Karembeu said. “Because I’m in mourning.” Asked if these were assassinations, Karembeu replied: “I didn’t want to, because the word is strong, but ... it’s true that, yes, it’s an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.” French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency that was imposed earlier this month. Deadly violence erupted in the French Pacific territory after protests kicked off against the French government’s attempts to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia, where pro-independence Indigenous Kanaks have long pushed to be free of France, amid sharp economic disparities. Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu's great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals.” AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Together with better drought forecasting, this can help the Horn of Africa build resilience against future droughts and promote sustainable development opportunities. Based on my co-authored research on groundwater in the region , I propose that a strategic network of deep groundwater bores (boreholes) be considered at regional scale to support both acute humanitarian relief efforts and longer term drought resilience building. Beyond the humanitarian crises, the recurring droughts in the Horn of Africa cause spikes in food prices , reduce gross domestic product across the region, and intensify insecurity and conflict risk. Recent prolonged droughts have been followed by flooding , which can displace entire communities. The world's largest population of nomadic herders lives in the Horn of Africa. They make up half the population in some countries. The herders are increasingly chasing rains that never come, or come all at once. Smallholder farmers are also affected and crops fail. Over 40 million people in regional border areas have little or no water infrastructure . Studies by institutions such as the British Geological Survey , United States Geological Survey and World Bank Group have confirmed voluminous resources across sub-Saharan Africa. Based on our review of this information, we believe a network of deep groundwater bores can work in the Horn of Africa. Groundwater supplies half of all drinking water and approximately one-third of irrigation and industry water in the world. Unlike surface water (rivers, streams and lakes) and shallower aquifers , deeper groundwater resources may present climate resilient, unpolluted and plentiful supplies of water in times of drought. In the Horn of Africa, studies confirm that deep groundwater is often available in drought hotspots. Recurrent drought hotspots are well-known. Droughts can be increasingly predicted and groundwater infrastructure prepared in advance. Where it is refilled from time to time, using groundwater can be sustainable. Recent reinterpretations of old well data indicates that about 400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools of rechargeable fresh groundwater exist in Somalia. Nearby Tanzania has a deep aquifer, estimated to have enough water for two million people . Groundwater can also support emergency drought relief operations as it can be up to 50 times cheaper to supply to communities than water delivered by trucks. The network of deep bores could be a mixture of supply to communities with the water they need every day or for drought emergencies when other water supplies run out, dependent on factors such as resource sustainability and local preferences. The communities who are most affected by drought in the Horn of Africa, and their seasonal movements, are also well known. This means they can be more effectively supported by networked groundwater supplies. Drilling down to this water and extracting it is not easy. It requires detailed knowledge of the local hydrogeology, and specialized drilling and pumping equipment. So it makes sense for the five affected countries to share knowledge and resources. The Groundwater Access Facility will bring countries together to collaborate on groundwater mapping and data sharing. It could also look at ways to use new and advanced renewable energy and water treatment technologies and how to secure climate finance to invest in the project. It is vital that local communities be included in the planning, design, running and maintenance of the boreholes. Working with hydro-geologists and other experts, communities can help decide the best locations for the boreholes. Deep borehole development should form part of managing water resources more holistically. For example, in places where flood follows drought , plans may be made to capture and store floodwater. Deep boreholes could be connected to smallholder farming projects to support emergency food and feed production. The boreholes could also become assets around which to coordinate emergency drought relief efforts and future resilience building programs. Precedents for accessing deep groundwater exist globally and lessons on collaborative governance may be gained from existing regional initiatives on management of major rivers. Many questions remain. For example, how would deep boreholes affect the movement and decisions of nomadic herders or displaced communities? Could boreholes cause conflict in already fragile settings? Should fossil (non-renewable) aquifers be accessed? Will the borehole water need to be purified? How can overpumping and other problems be prevented? Because drought knows no boundaries, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, South Sudan and Uganda must work together to answer these questions and to create drought resilience and sustainable development opportunities across the whole region. The Groundwater Access Facility is a platform for them to plan how to manage groundwater in the region sustainably . A strategic network of deep groundwater bores may support such potentially transformative regional ambitions.

        "content": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "Cement has reared its gray and flaking head into my attention again recently. The global use of about 4.1 billion tons of the stuff to make perhaps 40 billion tons of concrete is responsible for around 10% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally. It’s one of the few industrial products that competes with fossil fuels for sheer, absurd scale, and of course it’s one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels as well. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just avoid using so much of it? Thankfully, the answer to that question is yes. There are three major levers being pulled by forward thinking jurisdictions and construction organizations, and there’s a bonus lever that forward projections of cements growth seem to fail to account for. (Yes, I sense a decade by decade cement demand, supply, and decarbonization projection through 2100 emerging). There’s even a good economic reason that means that many of these levers are being pulled with or without climate action. What lever is that you ask? Well, concrete is 11% to 15% of the total cost of commercial buildings. Developers aren’t in the business of charity, they are in the business of profits. Some of the levers involve reducing capital costs and don’t cost nearly as much as they used to, so many more developers are applying them during design to optimize their returns. Of course, the bigger the building, the more likely the developers are to be well informed, well supported with the toolkits necessary for optimization and able to enforce them. Getting a foundation poured for a shed in your backyard? The contractor is not likely to be using these tools. First up, are we by any chance wasting any concrete, the stuff cement gets made into? Yes, in two different ways. Estimates are that the average job site wastes 3% to 5% of the concrete it orders. Some of that is through over ordering and then scrapping the stuff. Some of it is spillage. Some of it is concrete forms breaking because they weren’t put together properly. Some of it is delays that lead to the concrete setting before it’s poured. All of that is amenable to reduction. The biggest lever is software, actually, and that’s going to be a recurrent theme. The industry standard software for designing buildings these days is Revit, and one of the things that emerges with it is the building information management (BIM) model. It’s a tremendous amount of meta-data about everything in the building, and it’s shared — at least on well run projects — with everyone involved so that they can make efficient decisions. Just working up a detailed model and BIM can result in much more precise quantification of the cement required. That over ordering problem diminishes. Then there are 4D scheduling approaches, once again software-enabled. This takes a model and BIM, and semi-automatically based on obvious things — foundations before walls, lower floors must be in place before upper floors, floors, and walls need to be in place before windows and doors, etc. — establishes the order in which the building will unfold. This often includes animations of the building emerging. This process decomposes the work down so that any day or week’s required concrete will be much better understood, so less of a safety net is required. Of course, humans will be humans, and worksites will be worksites, so accidents will happen and forms will be messed up. But that 3% to 5% can be cut down substantially. In general, major infrastructure projects like bridges and tunnels will be much more precisely managed, so there’s little opportunity for savings in them, but about 60% of concrete is used in buildings, so there’s a lot of savings to be had. Assuming 2% savings, that turns into about 50 million tons of cement a year in savings at about a ton of carbon dioxide per ton of cement. But there’s another, hidden problem of concrete waste, over-dimensioning, which is the practice of designing structural elements larger than necessary for safety or performance, leading to excess use of materials and increased costs. Why would anyone do that, you are asking. In a lot of cases, it’s just an excess of caution. There are rules of thumb in civil engineering and construction that aren’t accurate, but do lead to buildings staying up. Some of it is just laziness because doing the engineering work is hard. Some of it is cheapness because structural engineers cost money. Some of it is just because a building collapsing is really bad for business. Enter finite element analysis software such as ANSYS, Abaqus, and SAP2000, which can perform detailed simulations to predict how structures will respond to various loads and stresses. This helps in designing walls that are appropriately dimensioned based on precise engineering calculations. This software is vastly more available to construction industry professionals than it used to be, including as plugins to Revit. (If you can imagine something an architect or building engineer might possibly want to do with Revit, there are probably a dozen available plugins for it.) Some studies have found up to 15% concrete savings are reasonable with finite element analysis, as over-dimensioning is so common. Assuming 10% savings on average, that’s 250 million tons of cement, hence carbon dioxide, that could be saved annually. Now we’re starting to see some big numbers. There’s another emerging toolset for building designers — generative design software. Imagine software which tries out a thousand different designs to find the best performance-to-cost ratio. Machine learning algorithms are now parsing vast amounts of data and suggesting optimized designs from scratch. Real-world case studies are finding 20% to 30% materials savings over buildings (and airplanes and products) designed with generative tools and AI. Assuming 20%, that’s a potential 400 million tons of cement and hence carbon dioxide savings annually for the building sector. For certain classes of infrastructure, this holds promise for reducing concrete requirements as well, pushing into that 40% that previous options had already seen every lever pulled. The potential for savings increases further. That’s two levers down, avoiding wastage and optimizing materials. We’re starting to cook with an induction cooktop at this point (cooking with gas is so 19th Century). The next lever is just not using concrete at all. Sweden and Canada are leaders in mass timber construction, where effectively plywood beams and panels are used as load bearing members — floors and walls — instead of concrete. Sweden allows buildings up to 16 stories high, while Canada allows up to 12 stories. Mass timber is by definition a durable wood product. It takes trees that have sucked down a lot of carbon dioxide as they grow and turns them into construction material that can last 100 years. When they are taken down eventually, there are approaches to disposal of them that inter the carbon dioxide with them. A ton of wood sequesters, counterintuitively, about a ton of carbon dioxide. That’s because it keeps the carbon, but returns the oxygen to the atmosphere. Only 37.5% of the carbon dioxide mass is kept, turning into cellulose. Mass timber gets that benefit. With current forestry, manufacturing, and distribution processes, there’s a carbon debt of 0.2 to 0.3 tons of carbon dioxide for a ton of mass timber, which is, after all 97% wood and 3% adhesives. As it stands, mass timber effectively sequesters about a ton of carbon dioxide for a hundred years, and depending on disposal during demolition, can sequester it permanently. Forestry, manufacturing, and distribution can all be electrified, and the electricity can all be low-carbon. If they are, that 0.2 to 0.3 tons drops to 0.03 tons, or 30 kilograms of carbon dioxide for a ton of mass timber that has sequestered a ton of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Building with mass timber turns buildings in carbon sinks, not carbon wells. Buildings that are 12 stories or taller represent approximately 0.0045% of all buildings in the United States, about 6,000 of the 131 million buildings. Europe has significantly fewer high-rise buildings compared to regions like Asia and North America. While China has a lot of bigger buildings, a coarse estimate suggests that at least 94% of buildings are still under 12 stories. The vast majority of new buildings are amenable to mass timber construction techniques. Coincidentally, modern mass timber construction uses the BIM to manufacture the beams, walls, and floors in factories. 4D scheduling lays out the order of construction, delivery, and installation. They are then delivered to sites and slotted into place like very big, very heavy LEGO pieces, but without the bright colors or chance of stepping on one barefoot in the dark. Concrete is still required for foundations, but mass timber even cuts back on that as mass timber is lighter than the usually reinforced concrete it replaces. That results in 20% to 30% savings in the amount of concrete required for the foundation of the building. And of course, there’s no concrete to speak of in the rest of the building. Hybrid buildings taller than the limits are not only possible, but multiple have been built. Concrete is used for the foundations and load bearing structures, but the walls and floors are mass timber. Total savings for full mass timber buildings are 60% to 70% of concrete, while hybrid buildings still see 40% to 50% reductions. Of course, a few big buildings make up for a lot of small buildings. Remember, 60% of 4.1 billion tons of cement is used in buildings. Even in China, perhaps 94% of new buildings could be constructed with full mass timber and the rest could be mixed. Of course, we already use wood for a lot of things, about two billion metric tons a year. However, a rough workup estimate, and hence coarse, just now suggests 500 to 700 million tons are for single use products such as pallets (over 90% of solid wood waste in US landfills), paper towels, and tissues which could be pivoted to multi-use products. 200 to 300 million tons are simply burned, a nonsensical act in my opinion and something which will likely diminish as more and more heat is electrified. Call it 500 million tons of wood available for mass timber from repurposing current forestry levels for better ends. Expanding sustainable forestry for this strong climate and environmental benefit makes sense. Let’s assume another 500 million tons of wood can be harvested sustainably. That’s a billion tons of engineered timber. Would that be enough to make a dent in the perhaps 25 billion tons of concrete used in buildings annually? It doesn’t look like it does it. But mass timber has one more trick up its sleeve. Its strength to weight ratio is a lot better than concrete. Using it for the same purposes — where applicable, not foundations — saves 80% of the weight over concrete. That means that billion tons is actually equivalent to about 4.8 billions tons of concrete, about a fifth of the annual use. That’s a wedge that could displace around 600 million tons of carbon dioxide a year and sequester in durable wood products for a 100 or more years about a billion tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Now that’s an atmospheric carbon drawdown wedge that makes sense. Even half of that is worth striving mightily for. There’s another way to avoid using concrete, of course. Reuse existing buildings instead of tearing them down and building new ones in their place. As I found when looking at Sublime Systems’ cement process , there are about 2 billion tons of concrete waste from demolition annually around the world. Most of that is from buildings, as infrastructure is built to last. Call it 85%. If 25% of the buildings were reused and renovated instead of demolished and new ones built, that’s another 20% wedge in concrete and hence cement use. The greenest building is the one that’s already built is the mantra applied to this wedge. All of these levers are coming into sharper focus with combinations of carbon pricing and regulations regarding carbon debt per cubic meter. A ton of cement in 2030 under the EU’s emissions trading scheme guidance will cost about €200 more. In Canada, it will cost CA$170 more. Those costs double the cost per ton of standard Portland cement. When 11% to 15% of a building’s cost jumps to 18% to 23%, every cost-saving trick in the book will be used much more stringently. Mass timber comes with a bit of a cost premium right now, and this makes it very competitive. Multiple jurisdictions have introduced regulations to limit carbon debt in buildings, including China, the EU, the UK, Canada, and cities in Canada. Standard wasteful concrete construction techniques need not apply if they want to be permitted. I promised a bonus item, and back we go to China. In 1990, China produced about 210 million tons of cement annually. In 2023, it produced 2.1 billion tons, a full ten times more. China used more cement in 2023 than the rest of the world combined, as is the case for an enormous number of other things, like steel. However, linear projections of cement growth start with the assumption that China’s demand will continue to rise, when in fact China has finished the majority of its infrastructure and building program. It has 177,000 kilometers of highway when none existed in 1987. It has 45,000 km of high-speed electric rail, up from about zero in 2007. It has absurd numbers of cities that didn’t exist in 1990 in anything like major urban centers, and while the number of ghost cities has plummeted, migration from rural to urban areas is still under way and there are still underpopulated cities with full transit and infrastructure. Just as with my steel projections through 2100, I project a reduction in China’s cement demand. That will be counterbalanced by an increase in cement and concrete, especially in Belt & Road Initiative countries — about three-quarters of the countries on the planet including lots in Eastern Europe and Latin America as well as rapidly developing economies like Indonesia, India, and Brazil. Overall, I’m debating whether cement demand globally will be flat or go down. I suspect we’ll actually see it go down, as the rapidly developing countries don’t have the conditions for the insanely rapid development China shot through over the past 40 years. If we assume a decline to 3.5 billion tons of cement annual demand as a baseline, and then start displacing cement with these other measures, napkin math suggests actual cement demand might drop to 2 billion tons a year. That’s about two billion tons less of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually and only two billion tons of cement we have to decarbonize to get to end of job. That’s a good news story.

        "content": "Here's your round-up of the latest Cardiff City news for Monday, May 27. Davies signs off in style in Belgium Isaak Davies is set to return to Cardiff City for pre-season after his successful loan spell at Kortrijk. The 22-year-old has was named player of the year at the Belgian side, netting 12 goals in 34 appearances, and will be hoping to make his mark on the Bluebirds upon his return.

Kortrijk avoided relegation from the top flight by beating Lommel in a play-off over the weekend, and are owned by City owner Vincent Tan. Harris - promotion best day of my career Former Cardiff City forward Mark Harris says promotion with Oxford United was the best day of his career so far. A brace from fellow former Bluebird Josh Murphy was enough to hand the U's a 2-0 win over Bolton Wanderers at Wembley in the League One play-off final, a sensational crescendo to a season that had seen Harris net 19 goals for the season. “It was the best day in football I’ve ever had. That feeling when that final whistle went was indescribable,\" he said. “The way the fans have been in the last few months, they’ve pushed us along. We were in a tough time three months ago, we lost 5-0 to Bolton, but the fans have been brilliant. “All the lads have been brilliant. We’re all together and we’ve all worked hard in this group, and we’ve done it.” Davies relishing international duty Cardiff City U18s attacker Jake Davies says he's relishing his time with Wales' U17s at the European Championships in Cyprus. Wales ended their campaign with a 1-1 draw with Croatia in their final group game. But despite failing to advance from Group B, Davies insists he's enjoyed the experience. \"It's been a great experience for us all so far,\" Jake began. \"Obviously, we're disappointed with the results in the first two games, but we're looking to bounce back in the final game against Croatia. \"I can take a lot from this camp. It's great for all of us and it will help us when we go back to our clubs.\"",

Furthermore, they can connect to an app and come with a travel case. Our review will tell you which parts of the Picun F6 are a success and where there may still be some room for improvement.",
        "content": "Stateside, the manufacturer Picun offers a wide range of headphones via its Amazon storefront. This includes special devices for kids, gaming and music. The F6 are its flagship headphones with ANC. Aside from reduced ambient noise, they supposedly also master head tracking and—according to the manufacturer—a battery life of up to 120 hours. The Picun F6 come in five different colors: silver, white, gray, blue and pink. You can get the headphones on Amazon for US$70. The scope of delivery includes a case that can be used to store the headphones when travelling. It is a hard case which means they are well protected and on the inside, a moulded part holds them in the correct position. A box inside the case includes additional accessories such as a fabric-covered 3.5 millimeter AUX cable, a USB cable (USB-A to USB-C) and an adapter intended for entertainment systems in airplanes. A power supply unit is not included with the headphones. After first switching the Picun F6 on, they are immediately displayed as an available Bluetooth device. If the Picun app is installed, the headphones are listed there as a nearby device. A Picun account must be created in order to use the full functionality of the app. When the app is opened for the first time, all content is displayed in Mandarin. The email used to confirm the email address is also written entirely in Mandarin. Using a translator may help, or you may just trust that clicking on the link in the text will bring the desired result. The F6 can be easily connected to various devices. However, they do not offer multi-device support with seamless switching. Picun uses buttons on the earpieces to operate the F6. With a little practice, they are easy to feel for and have a clear pressure point. The volume rocker can also be used to skip tracks. There is also a power button, a button for the ANC modes and one for 3D sound. With the exception of the spatial audio button, all controls—as well as the jack and USB connection—are located on the left-hand side. There are further customization options available via the Picun app, such as a low-latency mode. The software also offers an equalizer with six pre-set profiles. Further profiles can be created according to individual preferences. Head tracking and ANC modes can also be controlled via the app. When it comes to ANC, the software offers more choice than the button directly on the headphones. The button can only be used to switch between ANC on, ANC off or transparency mode. The software also offers low, medium, high and automatic levels for ANC mode. Head tracking and spatial sound effects can be switched through using the button on the headphones, but there is no announcement as to what is currently activated, only a different number of tones can be heard. These modes can also be selected in the app as \"Spatial Sound Effects\" and \"Head Tracking\". The position detection can also be calibrated or restarted. Picun claims that the F6 have a battery life of 120 hours. We have not measured this figure. Still, after a four-day trip with generous use (including 10 hours of flight time without battery operation, however), the headphones were still 50 per cent charged. The Picun F6 are quite large. The ear cups are large and so are the headphones in general. The tester wears a size 56 hat and has a narrow head, so he could leave the length adjustment in the smallest setting. The headphones start to slip quickly when working out. There is plenty of ear room—plus, the foam is soft and fits the tester's head well and loosely. Glasses tend not to get in the way and they can be worn for hours without any problems. However, the headphones have a strong chemical odor that could still be detected weeks later. The Picun F6 are well suited for listening to music. Their sound can be adjusted to your own preferences using the equalizer. The headphones can also handle bass without losing the other frequencies. However, voices without music, such as audio books, sound a little tinny. The sound becomes clearer and fuller when ANC and Spatial Sound Effects are activated. The headphones produce a good spatial sound. However, it makes no difference whether they play back stereo audio or 360 Reality Audio, as the Picun F6 don't support this format. The high-res claim on the packaging should also be treated with caution, as the headphones only support AAC and SBC as Bluetooth standards. Head tracking worked reliably during our test. Music is primarily emitted from one direction—this location can be set via the app. The sound then moves around the headphones when the wearer moves. This function is independent of the output format. However, ANC and the 3D functions are only possible in Bluetooth mode. As soon as the AUX cable is plugged in, the F6 switch them off. Thanks to their cable and adapter, the F6 work perfectly with built-in entertainment system on airplanes. It's just a shame that their noise reduction then no longer works. Overall, the Picun F6 offer good sound, especially when all functions are activated. Their ANC ensures a very low background noise, but you can only hear this if you concentrate on it. Ambient noise is reduced but air conditioning, aircraft turbines or voices are still audible—only muffled. Picun promises a lot for its F6. However, some of these promises should be taken with a pinch of salt. Although the F6 bear the high-res logo, they don't support the corresponding codecs. 360-degree audio is also not supported as a format. Apart from that, however, the over-ears left a good impression on us. They offer a good sound that can be adjusted using the equalizer. The 3D sound generated also sounds nice and their head tracking works reliably. This feature is fun but due to the headphones' lack of codec support, it cannot be compared with Apple's Spatial Audio for suitable content. The Picun F6 don't perform right at the top of any discipline. But they can do a lot—they sound good, play for a long time and are comfortable. We like their scope of delivery including all the required cables, an adapter and a case. Moreover, the Picun F6 boast impressive runtimes and they sit comfortably.",

        "content": "Urging the intervention of the Election Commission of India, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Saumitra Khan on Monday wrote a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar alleging that a strongroom has been breached in Bishnupur Constituency, adding that local police might be involved in the tampering of Electronic voting machines (EVMs). Highlighting his concerns in a letter to CEC Rajiv Kumar, Saumitra Khan who represents Bishnupur Lok Sabha since 2014, claimed that state police officials were present in the innermost perimeter of the strongroom which is in contravention to the rules of the poll body as only CAPF personnel are allowed there. “As per the ECI guidelines “Inner most perimeter shall be guarded by CAPF and outer perimeter by State Armed Police. For this purpose, a minimum one platoon CAPF for 24X7 security shall be provided to guard the strong room round the clock. To our utmost surprise we have seen Additional SP Masud Hassan and the Local IC Atanu Santra are going inside the inner most perimeter for security purposes. My question is to how they were given access to enter the Inner most perimeter?” the letter mentioned. He further said that Central Force Incharge AK Saha was also not present at the premises and the “main gates of entry to the Strong Room Building premises were kept open without any security deployment” “People were entering the premises without any proper check. Vehicle are entering the premises freely,” he wrote. He also alleged that CCTV footage at the strong room is being tampered by the local police. “They are also trying to get access to the already installed CCTVs so that they can manipulate the CCTV coverage and captured CCTV data,” the letter read. “This gives us a strong reason to believe that the local police and administration with try to manipulate the CCTV coverage and create few blind spots to enter the strong room and replace the polled EVMs with identical EVMs with false polled data,” Khan wrote. Saumitra Khan demanded that additional forces be deployed to ensure proper security. After voting gets concluded, the electronic voting machines (along with VVPATs) are kept in designated strongroom. “Further a system should be developed that no one can enter the entire premises without an appropriate ID card and specific purpose. I would also request you to take serious action against the officers involved,” he wrote. BJP leader Saumitra Khan is a two-time MP from Bishnupur. TMC fielded Sujata Mondal who is the former wife of Saumitra Khan. The polling for 42 seats of West Bengal is being held across all seven phases. The counting of votes is scheduled for June 4",

        "content": "New Delhi : Marten De Roon has officially announced that he will not be joining the Dutch National team for the upcoming European Championship (Euro 2024). The defensive midfielder was instrumental in Atalata’s season and got injured during the Coppa Italia final loss against Juventus. Despite De Roon’s absence, Atalanta beat an unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen side 3-0 in the final of the Europa League thanks to a hattrick by Ademola Lookman. “I can’t imagine I’ve had a week in my career or life that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn’t play the final, win the Europa League. In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can’t play the Euros,” read the tweet posted by De Roon on X (formerly known as Twitter). The Netherlands will face Canada and Iceland in two friendlies before turning their attention to the European championship where they are drawn in Group D. Getting through Group D will not be an easy task especially considering they will be facing powerhouses France and two very solid teams in Poland and Austria. “I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it’s a very tough day. Hup Holland, hup,” added the 33-year-old.",
