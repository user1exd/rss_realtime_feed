        "content": "Canadians feel both “optimism and concern” over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks, a new report says. The Leger study commissioned by Transport Canada found residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) — drones’ larger, typically human-piloted cousins. Despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility’s potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services, the survey showed. Comfort with those three uses of the technology in urban areas hovered at around 80 per cent. Surveying, inspections _ of power lines, for example — and cargo shipment also had overwhelming support. Only transport of people, rather than things, notched below 50 per cent in favour. “If we are talking about emergencies, then it’s a no-brainer. We are going to save lives and put out fires. But when it comes to transportation, it’s a no,” one participant told the pollsters. Further concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impact and privacy tempered enthusiasm for the aerial vehicles. “The outlook on advanced air mobility (AAM) in Canada is a complex blend of optimism and concern,” the report stated. “Issues such as the safety and privacy risks associated with drone use, the environmental footprint of AAM operations and the readiness for autonomous functions are especially significant worries.” More than half of respondents had reservations around safety and potential crashes. Well over one-third pointed to security threats and privacy fears. And between a quarter and a third highlighted prices, noise pollution and the impact on the environment. The “cautious optimism” of respondents toward drones and eVTOLs underscores their perceived benefits, the authors concluded. “Yet it also sends a clear message about the necessity to tackle safety, environmental, and social issues.” In Canada, drones are deployed for tasks ranging from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions and wildfire detection. Meanwhile air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis will be cleared for the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Some manufacturers have 2025 as their target, such as Silicon Valley’s Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. The whirly machines carry the promise of delivering people and goods across congested urban and suburban areas and between nearby cities. But headwinds around technology, regulation and investment remain, with Canada lagging behind some of its peers on policy. And whether aerial vehicles can move beyond a sleek slice of the ultrarich and the medical and cargo niches in the near term remains up in the air. Last week, Boeing Co. pledged $240 million toward a Montreal-area aerospace cluster that will include advanced air mobility research pertinent to its Whisk Aero subsidiary, which makes self-flying taxis. “The expertise here in autonomy is as good as, if not better than, pretty much everywhere else in the world,” said Boeing Global president Brendan Nelson in an interview, adding that certification is on the horizon. Despite ongoing innovation in Canada, more than three-quarters of respondents to the Leger survey had never heard of advanced air mobility. Awareness was higher among Canadians aged 18-34, those with a university diploma, men and Indigenous people and people of colour, the report found. The 99-page paper was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND) says it’s collaboration with other stakeholders is leading to a sustainable peace in the Niger Delta region. Speaking after the release of the foundation’s annual report for 2023, PIND’s Executive Director, Tunji Idowu, said collaborative efforts of the organisation with other key players have led to equitable economic development. The annual report is titled “Advancing Frontiers for Greater Impact”. Idowu said about 100 service providers through the foundation’s market systems development project supported over 49,000 farmers with 46.35% of them being females. He said that collaborative efforts between farmers and MSME birthed a tremendous investment in the threshold of over N10 billion. According to him, despite the socioeconomic challenges, including rising inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations which affected purchasing power in the country, the foundation continued to exceed expectations in delivering on its mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the region. “I recall how together with our partners, [PIND] continued to find creative, people-centered ways to carry out our mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the Niger Delta. “Being a Niger-Delta-centric organisation, which started in 2010 we started out by giving out grants to other implementers, this has since evolved into a go-to resource, convener, and implementer of development programs and projects for other donors in the region. “We largely accomplished this through robust programs focused on community-driven, research-backed needs: prosperity and peace through economic growth and peacebuilding. “In 2023, PIND consolidated all the achievements from its previous and ongoing work in the Niger Delta while exploring new opportunities for improving livelihoods and ensuring lasting peace in a once conflict-ridden region,” Idowu said.",

        "content": "Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won’t face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province’s law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. “(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips’ data,” reads the letter, dated May 17. “The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service’s) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.” The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. “(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,” the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name “Mike Corps,” which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk’s offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "description": "The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks",
        "content": "A British official called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to ratify the ’s entry into a by the end of the year, despite opposition from some Canadian agriculture groups. The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks, which may also be delaying Canadian action to help the U.K. join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, known by the acronym CPTPP. The U.K. signed onto the latter accord last July, and its Parliament formally ratified the deal last week. But before it can start enjoying the benefits, the U.K. needs six of the CPTPP’s 11 members to ratify its accession — and so far only Singapore, Japan, and Chile have done so. Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng has yet to introduce a ratification bill in the country’s House of Commons. Jennifer Fagan, head of economics and trade at the U.K. High Commission in Canada, said her country is especially keen to have Canada’s support, given their close ties as allies and Canada’s status as chair of the CPTPP Commission this year. “We understand that it’s a busy parliamentary season for Canada, but we’re hoping that it’ll be imminent that Canada will put that legislation forward,” Fagan said in an interview. Fagan said she believes the U.K. will get enough other countries to ratify before the end of 2024, but would hope that Canada does so given that it was “an early champion of the U.K. accession.” Fagan made the comments shortly before British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called an election for July 4, which polls suggest the Labour Party will win. Under Sunak, the U.K. suspended free trade talks with Canada after Trudeau’s government allowed some post-Brexit trade provisions to expire. Those included a temporary arrangement that permitted low-tariff exports of British cheese to Canada and another that affected British auto exports to Canada. Canadian and British officials insist those issues are separate from discussions around CPTPP. But there may be other reasons Canada is dragging its heels. An alliance of Canadian agriculture groups is lobbying against the U.K.’s accession to the Pacific pact, arguing that it doesn’t give enough access for producers currently blocked from the U.K. market. “This agreement does not achieve any meaningful market access for the Canadian beef and pork industries and creates significant barriers for Canadian farmers, ranchers and producers,” the coalition says on its website. Ng said Canada still supports the U.K.’s entry into CPTPP but remained non-committal on a timeline for a vote in parliament. “It’s definitely in the queue,” she said in a phone interview while attending a trade forum in Peru. “It’s certainly something we’ve committed to doing, and we intend to.”",

        "content": "AS Jarvis Cocker and Pulp once sang, Do You Remember The First Time? Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George , Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer, showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. DUAL frontmen Pete Doherty and Carl Barat formed the Libertines while living together in Camden Road, topping and tailing in a single bed with no covers. And the pair would often put on impromptu “guerilla gigs” at their flat, sometimes with less than an hour’s notice. Carl, 45, says: “Peter’s parents were in an Army base so they’d always come home and bring supplies, like crates of beer and cigarillos, cigars and frankfurter sausages. “So we made a bar and invited everyone in Camden.” Pete, 45, adds: “I’d say to Carl, ‘Look, don’t get the hump, but I’ve put online we’re doing a gig in the front room in an hour’. “He’d be fuming, like, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve got my washing drying!’. “Like basic things, perfectly reasonable, but he’d still do it.” As the Libertines got more popular, fans would cram into the living room and the police would turn up. Carl says: “The front door ended up broken and we had to climb through a window. “We finally got booted out when we nicked all the money out of the electricity meter. I do look back and think, ‘Jesus, that was disgusting, I wouldn’t do that again’. “But then also think, if you’re an artist, you need to live your life before you can write about it. “And those formative times you have are everything.” THE Good Mixer was the place to be for anyone in the Britpop crowd during the Nineties. The toilets in the small, two-roomed Irish bar are even said to be where Oasis and Blur’s feud first began — with Oasis singer Liam Gallagher saying to Blur guitarist Graham Coxon: “Nice music, s**t clothes.” Liam’s brother Noel, 56, says: “As I remember it, we were just good-naturedly ribbing Graham Coxon. “But it turns out it probably wasn’t that good-natured.” And Blur were not the only band Liam, 51, clashed with there. The Libertines’ Pete Doherty and Carl Barat recall seeing Oasis propping up the bar there during their heyday. But when they went over to try to talk to Liam, Carl says: “He kept knocking me out the way, like it was his defence mechanism.” Pete adds: “I was like, ‘Liam, we’ve got a basement round the corner, you should come and play some stuff’. “He goes, ‘Mate, I don’t do that sort of thing because I’m the devil’s d**k’. “That was the best thing I’d ever heard. But a bit disappointing, as well.” THE singer, who died in 2011 at the age of 27, lived in the borough and was a regular drinker at The Hawley Arms, where she would hop behind the bar to pull pints. Amy’s former manager, Nick Shymansky, says in the documentary: “Genuinely, from the moment I heard her voice, and met her, I was completely convinced. “I had no doubt she was the best of the best.” He adds: “The big record at the time was the Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill and not long after I heard Amy’s demo, I remember instantly going this is as good as Lauryn Hill, if not better. “So whatever I do, I have to work with this artist. “The first deal we did was a publishing deal and she got her cheque and was like, ‘Right, I’m going to buy a flat in Camden’, and then a whole new thing opened up. “Her idea of a good night would be to see someone live, play some pool, have a cocktail, go back, roll a spliff, play music until 2 or 3 in the morning, and not get up until lunchtime the next day.” Nick adds that when success came for Amy, however, it wasn’t enough. He explains: “The first record wasn’t full of hit songs and maybe it hadn’t fulfilled her in the way she was hoping it would. “That was the moment where this void opened up and as an artist I think she wanted to be seen as someone a little bit more exciting and edgy. “Camden at that point was probably quite a dangerous place for someone like her to live. “She started to go out to the pubs, the drink maybe turned into a line. It was her nature of drinking people under the table, the ‘I can do more drugs, I can be more wild, I can be more dangerous’ attitude. “She got lost in it.” IRISH pub The Dublin Castle is famous for having hosted everyone from Blur to The Killers and Arctic Monkeys. Its legendary status dates back to 1979 when the late Alo Conlon, landlord at the time, decided to indulge seven teenagers claiming to be a jazz band. That band was a local rabble known as Madness. Frontman Suggs, 63, recalls: “We’d been into a lot of pubs, so this was like our last chance. We walked in and it was like being in Cork. “They asked what sort of music we played and we said country and western, thinking it’s going to go down better with an Irish crowd. “Then Woody, at the back, helpfully chipped in with, ‘And a bit of jazz’.” They were given a trial slot for that Wednesday — and “they packed us out,” says current landlord Henry Conlon. He adds: “I remember being in the back bar peeping over at these young skinheads.” Madness then got a residency at the pub, with queues out the door every Wednesday. Suggs says: “It was 75p to get in, so we’d get a fiver each. “One night I put my foot through the monitor and that was 40 quid so we all went home skint.” The band later filmed the video for hit 1979 single My Girl at the pub. In it, Alo can be seen at the start, referring to himself as “the governor”. ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids. No one’s coming in because they’ve heard Wonderwall on the radio.” He adds: “We were into making money and having a good time and all of the girls and drugs and all of that”. But they soon hit the big time. Liam and his then-wife Patsy Kensit, 56, moved to posh Primrose Hill, while Noel and his then-wife Meg Mathews, 58, were in nearby Steele’s Road. Their seven-bedroom mansion, affectionately named Supernova Heights, was where the Primrose Hill set — which included actor Jude Law and model Kate Moss — would throw outrageous parties, packed to the brim with A-list stars. But Noel recalls that one time fans managed to gatecrash. He says: “Someone thought they were my mates, and I thought they were someone else’s. “Turns out they were a random group of indie kids who’d followed us back from the bar, wearing Doc Martens and jackets. “They’d just wandered in and sat there for hours. I was like, ‘Can you f*** off then?’.”",

Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. 9 Pete Doherty, left, recalls meeting Liam Gallagher in a new Disney+ documentary about the music scene in Camden Credit: PA 9 Rocker Liam pictured with then-wife Patsy Kensit Credit: Getty The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George, Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer, showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. Camden is available to stream on Disney+ from tomorrow.

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail A banking code of conduct that would regulate branch closures similar to regulations in the UK would be a crucial way to safeguard access to cash for regional communities, according to a finance expert. A senate report released on Friday found more than 2100 bank branches were closed in Australia between 2017 and 2023 - almost 40 per cent of branches. It also found while the use of cash is declining across the economy, cash ﻿and face-to-face banking services remain important in regional and remote areas, during times of crisis and by the vulnerable, elderly and disabled. READ MORE: Community rallies for mother mourning death of her toddler son﻿ Cash is still king in many communities across Australia, despite the rise of digital banking. (Reuters/Edgar Su/File Photo) The report listed eight recommendations including that ﻿the government recognises access to financial services as an \"essential service\" and that it creates a mandatory banking code of conduct, citing the UK model as an example. RMIT University finance researcher and associate professor Dr Angel Zhong supports a mandatory banking code of conduct in Australia that would require banks to consult with the community and seek regulatory approval before closing a branch. She cited the UK's \"three-mile rule\", where ﻿banks are required to provide free cash services within three miles (4.8km) for rural residents and one mile (1.6km) for urban dwellers. This doesn't necessarily have to be via a bank branch or ATM, but can also include shops that offer cash-out transactions for free and other alternatives.﻿ Introduced last year, the legislation aims to maintain current levels of access to cash across the UK by fining banks that fall below a minimum level of service.﻿ \"The UK's approach recognises that while digital payments are on the rise, cash remains essential for certain transactions,\" Zhong said. \"﻿By safeguarding access, they address the concerns of rural communities and vulnerable individuals.\"﻿ Australia's geography and distribution of population makes the three-mile rule difficult to replicate in Australia, an Australian Banking Association spokesperson told 9news.com.au. \"Australia has unique geographical challenges with cash distribution that many other countries don't face,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Australia for example is 32 times the size of the United Kingdom. \"The banking sector remains committed to ensuring cash continues to be accessible to customers. \"Banks provide fee-free ATM withdrawals at 85 of Australia's most remote communities. \"Banks also pay for cash services to be available at around 1800 regional Bank@Post locations.\" The senate report's recommendations also include the expansion of Bank@Post services with Australia Post as well as the establishment of a community banking program and examining the feasibility of a publicly owned bank.﻿ Given the history of state-owned banks within Australia, Zhong said that option should be a \"last resort\". \"I think (the mandatory code of conduct) is a better approach to strike a balance between preserving the value of taxpayers' money and also ensuring that within Australia, Australians have access to cash and banking facilities.\"",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open The Spaniard has been close to unbeatable here since winning his first French Open title as a teenager in 2005. He had lost only three out of 115 matches - and dropped only three sets in his previous 18 first round appearances. But Nadal, who turns 38 next month, lost that many sets in just over three hours yesterday as Rome Masters champion Zverev won 6-3 7-6 6-3. After the defeat, Nadal said: \"I would love to thank you all it's difficult for me to talk I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you, I don't know if it is the last time, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt. \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player. For me it's tough to say what's going on in the future. \"There's a bg percentage I won't be back here, but I can't say 100%. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it's enough, I can't give anything else, but it's something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that's motivation. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable – I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it's been a beautiful process. Every year has been different and what it makes it seem so special are the people behind the... Neil McLeman at Roland Garros",

The Mexican was eliminated in Q1 in Monte Carlo before an opening-lap tangle with Kevin Magnussen brought an end to his race on Sunday. Perez's future beyond 2024 has been a contentious topic for over 12 months now. The 34-year-old struggled throughout the middle portion of the 2023 season, but a more composed end to the year combined with four podiums in five races to kick off 2024 looked to have secured his position within the team. However, since then, his form has tailed off. The Mexican was nowhere near the pace of Lando Norris and Max Verstappen in Miami, and at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a weak qualifying session forced him to settle for a P8 finish on race day.

The Scot was thrashed in straight sets by Stan Wawrinka at the French Open to follow his early exit in Australia. The three-time Major winner, 37, claimed before the event that he had still to decide if he will retire this summer. \"When the time is right, I will stop\" he said. Murray has always believed he has a final \"good run\" in a Grand Slam but he has now failed to get past the third round in 14 Majors since reaching the 2017 Wimbledon quarter-finals. Pete Sampras won the 2002 US Open final in his last ever match after two years without a title while world No.1 Ash Barty retired aged 25 in 2022 after winning the Australian Open.

        "description": "Grave lapses at Delhi Baby Care Centre, fire safety norms flouted",
        "content": "Listen to Story After a major blaze at the Baby Care Centre in Delhi's Vivek Vihar cost seven newborns their lives, authorities discovered grave lapses at the medical facility. As per a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) report, it emerged that the registration certificate of the Baby Care Centre issued on September 30, 2023 in the name of Dr Naveen Khichi had expired on March 31, 2024, but it continued operating, that too with some 'nonqualified' staff. Aditinally, there were no emergency exits in the building, fire extinguishers and fire alarms were not functioning properly, there were no smoke detectors and water sprinkler systems, among others. The police said they would examine the academic degrees of the accused and the documents regarding the registration of the hospital. Several locals living in the neighbourhood have alleged that oxygen cylinder refilling was being done at the hospital. Also, the FIR registered in the matter said that there were 27 oxygen cylinders kept illegally at the facility, five of which exploded during the fire on Saturday night. It was also learnt that Naveen Khichi was also running another nursing home \"illegally\" in West Delhi's Paschimpuri and a case was registered against him. Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Monday swung into action and ordered a fire audit of all the health facilities falling under its ambit in the wake of the grave lapses that emerged at the Baby Care Centre. Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday held a meeting with state officials and said that all government and private health facilities were required to submit a fire audit report by June 8, 2024. The health facilities would have to furnish details of the installation of smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and water sprinklers, while the Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) has been instructed to conduct sudden and random checks at hospitals and nursing homes. There has also a political slugfest erupted over the fire tragedy with the Delhi BJP alleging that the health minister's OSD had a role in the 'illegal' running of the child care facility. Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said \"The health department, during an inspection in 2021, found the children's hospital capable of admitting five newborns only, but the officer on special duty (OSD) of the health minister on an application of the hospital owner tried to approve its capacity to 10 admissions\". However, Bharadwaj assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty and no one would be spared. He claimed that the BJP was lying, and the hospital was given permission for only five beds. Notably, the Delhi Revenue Department has been instructed to extend financial aid and compensation to bereaved families. Also, the Delhi government has decided to felicitate two nurses and five neighbours with bravery awards for their selfless acts during the fire tragedy.",

The ACCC green-lit that $438 million deal at the same time Petstock and Woolworths agreed to divest the same 41 stores and 25 vet clinics PetO has today acquired, after claims of anti-competitive behaviour when Petstock originally bought those stores (and didn't notify the ACCC of the acquisitions).

The group is advocating for a stand-alone hospice care site in Lethbridge to serve the city and surrounding communities. READ MORE: Foundation advocates for stand-alone hospice care centre in southern Alberta On May 25, 2024, the foundation hosted its third annual ‘Walk to Remember’. Not only did the event aim to raise funds and awareness, but it allowed participants to pay tribute to lost loved ones. One of the foundation’s directors, Celeste Ment, says although they may not physically be with us, loved ones who have passed on are always with us in our hearts and our memories. Events like Saturday’s walk serve as reminders of the influences lost relatives and loved ones have on the people who knew them throughout their lives. The ‘Walk to Remember’ is one of the many fundraising events hosted by the foundation. Up next is a charity golf tournament at Land-O-Lakes Golf & Country Club in Coaldale.

        "content": "With a 4-1 record, 0.93 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 29 innings, Garrett Crochet has built a spiffy resume to submit for AL Pitcher of the Month honors. What Crochet’s workload will look like in June, July and beyond bears watching. The White Sox most certainly are watching every pitch. “It’s kind of like [Carlos] Rodon [in 2021, coming back from shoulder and elbow problems], take it outing by outing, see how it is,” pitching coach Ethan Katz said in a recent conversation with the Sun-Times. “At the All-Star break bring him back last, and when we have an extra day give him an extra day and be mindful of stressful innings.” Crochet is a starter for the first time after elbow (Tommy John) and shoulder surgeries derailed his career. And so his workload will be monitored. Katz, Pedro Grifol and the training staff, with input from Crochet, are taking it inning by inning. “If innings are easy, stress is less, those are days we can push him a little,” Katz said. “Those are the conversations we have, check the biochemanics we have, make sure he’s not losing his delivery, watching the radar gun during the game to make sure the velo is good and make the best decisions possible. As we go on,continue to see how things go.” Proponents of a six-man rotation – Tuesday starter Mike Clevinger is among them – that would give Crochet and others an extra day of rest need to consider the impact it would have on the bullpen, cutting the number of relievers from eight to seven. “You have a bullpen to protect,” Katz said. The same goes for using Crochet as an opener for multiple starts as a way of reducing his innings, a possibility the Sox have discussed. An opener pitching two innings is going to require a multi-innings reliever or two as well. “So it’s hard to do those things without other guys getting impacted,” Katz said. In any case, Crochet (5-5, 3.68), the AL leader with 85 strikeouts, is a prized commodity who will be watched. At 63 2/3 innings, he’s already past his career high of 54 1/2 in 2021, all in relief. “You have to be mindful of what you see, what goes on behind the scenes, and rest and recovery,” Katz said. “He does a really good job taking care of himself in the gym, with nutrition, he’s on top of everything.” In May, Crochet ranks third in ERA and first in WHIP and strikeouts among AL pitchers. Nick Nastrini allowed three runs over five innings in his second start since getting recalled from Triple-A Charlotte and his second start against the Blue Jays in six days. In Toronto Wednesday, he was tagged for nine runs (eight earned) in 3 1/3 innings. Nastrini struck out five and allowed three hits but he walked four. He has walked 17 in 16 1/3 innings in his rookie season.",

        "content": "Lawyer and human rights activist Funmi Falana (SAN) discusses the court ruling against Regulations 126 and 127 of the Nigeria Police Force, which allows the dismissal of unmarried pregnant policewomen, with AJIBADE OMAPE What were the specific regulations declared illegal by the Court of Appeal in Abuja regarding the dismissal of unmarried pregnant policewomen? Police Regulation 126 specifies that no woman police officer shall be allowed to get married within the first three years of entering into service, and Regulation 127 now states that if they do, they will be dismissed from police service. However, this regulation specifically targets women police officers, whereas the same is not required of policemen. These regulations were challenged in court. It also happened that one Omalola Olujide, who was a police officer somewhere in Ekiti State Police Command, was dismissed because she became pregnant. So, we went to court last year to challenge those regulations. The court said that the regulations were unconstitutional and violated her rights to freedom from discrimination because any provision that is made in any organisation should be for both men and women. Any provision that targets a woman and does not apply to the male counterpart is inconsistent with the provision of the constitution that says there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex. Such a provision is null and void due to the inconsistency with the Constitution. So the court struck down that provision and declared the dismissal of Omolola Olujide from police service as illegal. Fortunately, the NBA had gone to court initially, but not specifically on the case of Olujide, but they went to court to ask that the regulations 126 and 127 should be struck down, and the court dismissed their application initially at the Federal High Court. So they now filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal granted their application two days ago. I think sometime last week. The court declared that regulations 126 and 127 are inconsistent with the provision of section 42 and of course section 37 of the constitution. Section 37 of the constitution provides that there shall be rights to privacy and that if any woman is deprived of becoming pregnant, that is an infringement on her right to privacy. Of course, if that provision is targeted at female police officers and is not applied to male police officers, it is, again, inconsistent with section 42 which talks about freedom from discrimination. So the Court of Appeal last week granted the application of the NBA and while the Court of Appeal was granting that application, it referred to our own case that was already granted by the Federal High Court last year as an authority that is cited in courts. It affirmed that these provisions are inconsistent with the constitution and they are null and void as to the inconsistency. Can you explain the implications of the court’s decision on Regulations 126 and 127 of the Nigerian Police for unmarried pregnant policewomen? Yes, the implication is that that pronouncement is now a law. This is because, luckily for us in Nigeria, state decisions are one of our sources of law. When I say state decisions, I mean judicial precedent, when an issue goes to court and the court pronounces on that issue. The pronouncement of the court becomes the law on that issue. So as of today, the law in this country regarding police regulations 127 and 126 is that they are expunged from the law because the court has so pronounced that they are inconsistent with the provision of the constitution and they should be struck down. So having been struck down by the court, the implication is that those laws no longer exist. They are no longer part of the police regulation as of today, by virtue of the pronouncement of the decision of the Court of Appeal last week. So that is the implication of that decision and that is the law as of today. Do you see the dismissal of Omolola Olujide as an act of discrimination against women in the police force? The entire police regulations 126 and 127 are inconsistent with the provision of the constitution. They are discriminatory. Those laws are discriminatory against women and it was based on the fact that they are discriminatory against women that they were struck down by the court. So the dismissal of Omolola Olujide is inconsistent with her right to freedom from discrimination and that was what the court held, so the court also ordered that Omolola Olujide be reinstated back in the police force. Now that the court has declared the dismissal illegal, is Omolola Olujide going to be reinstated into the police force? Oh yes, that will be done. When we got this decision of the court’s judgment, we sent it to the Inspector General of Police and the Inspector General of Police replied to us as a lawyer to Omolola Olujide that the police were working on her reinstatement and that Omolola Olujide would be re-absorbed into the police force based on the order of the court, and any act of victimisation of course will also be answerable in court. If anybody victimises her based on her being re-absorbed into the police force, she has a right to challenge that in court again. Can women from other security agencies benefit from this judgment? Yes, they can benefit from it. There are similar provisions in the Immigration Service as well and I think the Nigerian Drug and Law Enforcement Agency. But unfortunately, this particular judgment is specifically on regulations 127 and 126 of the police force. So until such provisions in other sister organisations, and other security organisations are taken to court, they may not be able to take benefit from it. But such provisions in other security organisations could be challenged in court and this case will be referred to in court as a precedent or as a judicial precedent. The court will now take cognisance of this particular rule to strike down the other provisions. But because most of the provisions are not specifically mentioned, in this decision, they may not be able to take the direct benefit. Until we take their provisions to court and the court makes pronouncement of them, they may not be able to take the benefit of this provision because the court specifically mentioned police regulation.” Do you believe the same police regulation should have applied to male police officers who aren’t married but get women pregnant? Of course, that was our argument in court. We said if you are saying a woman should not get married and should not become pregnant, what happens to a policeman who impregnates another woman? A man and a woman should be treated equally. So if a condition specifies that a woman should be so treated, the male counterparts should also be so treated, that was our argument. But unfortunately, you will agree with me that every day men impregnate women and nobody gets to know because men do not carry pregnancies. When I was arguing this case in court, I told the court that of course the person who impregnated Omolola Olujide is a man and he’s a police officer who is still in police service, and the woman, because of this same pregnancy was dismissed. This is discriminatory. Can you elaborate on the Court of Appeal’s reasoning behind the ruling in favour of the Nigeria Bar Association? The reason is that discrimination has been expunged from the law in all civilised communities. Also, the constitution of Nigeria, which we call the ground law specifically mentions in section 42 that nobody shall be discriminated against on the basis of sex and of course on place of origin. Now, if regulations 127 and 126 are placed side by side, and juxtaposed with section 42, they cannot stand. They cannot stand if they are juxtaposed with section 42 of the constitution because any provision that is made in any organisation should apply to both men and women. If they do not apply to both men and women, then they become discriminatory, and so the court said this type of law cannot stand in any civilised community, and our country should not be an exception. So the court ordered that the organisations involved should take steps to expunge this from the regulation. Now, perhaps I should let you know that there is also another regulation which is Regulation 124. What that specifies is that a woman should not get married within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force unless she takes the permission of her superior officer, and in obtaining that permission of the supervising officer, she must bring the would-be husband, before the supervising officer for approval. That’s section 124, and that we took to court some years ago, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid versus Attorney General of the Federation. So that case was handled by my own organisation, my NGO. I went to court on behalf of my NGO to tell the court that such a provision of the law cannot stand in the face of section 42, because a man who enters into the police force could get married and not have to bring his own fiancé before the superior officer, but the woman will be compelled, otherwise, she will be dismissed from the police force. So we went to court and the court said that provision was inconsistent with the provision of the constitution and it was struck that down. So three provisions have been struck down by the court now. Provision 124, and that was in the case of Women Empowerment and Legal Aid versus Attorney General of the Federation, and that was in the year 2011. It was struck down based on the fact that it was inconsistent with section 42 of the constitution. Also, regulations 126 and 127 were equally struck down based on the same reason. Now the reason for the two, of course, is the fact that those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is null and void as to the level and the extent of its inconsistency. How does the court’s judgment address the issue of privacy and discrimination against female police officers within the Nigerian Police Force? Yes, section 37 provides that every person shall have the right to privacy. In other words, you have the right to determine when to get married, who to get married to, when to have a baby, and when not to have a baby. As a matter of fact, the extension of that law is the third-generation rights we call the reproductive rights of women. The reproductive rights of women go further to give you the right to decide who to get married to, and when to get married, who to be your partner, and who not to be your partner. So these are the rights to privacy, and by extension, the reproductive rights of women. So the court now held that any law that takes away this right to privacy is inconsistent with the provision of the constitution. Such a law violates one’s right to privacy, and it cannot stand in the face of any law in any civilised community. What was the court’s position on the principles of morality, discipline, and gender equality in its judgment? Yes, the police argued that they were trying to protect women, and of course, they were also trying to protect the police force from abuse. In other words, a woman who becomes pregnant may not be able to function properly. They also argued that the women knew that this provision existed when they were applying to join the police force, and they should have opted to say, I don’t want to go into the police force because of that. They noted that having seen the provision and still went ahead to join the police force, they must have waived their rights. That was the argument of the police. The court addressed that by saying, that any law that is a law cannot be waived, especially the rights under the Constitution. Morality is different from law, a law is a law and must be obeyed, especially when it is the provision of the Constitution. It cannot be waived by any person, and so, the argument that they waived their rights, or the argument that they are trying to defend or morally protect the police force cannot stand in the face of the provision of the Constitution. What are the broader implications of this court decision for the Nigerian Police Force and its regulations? The implication is that all these provisions that have been specified would be expunged from their law, they cease to become part of the law, and so, a woman can now become pregnant within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force without any punitive measure. They also can get married within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force without any penalty. Because all these laws that prohibit these actions have been taken away by the decision of the court. So, they cease to be part of the laws of the land. That is the implication. How does this judgment align with the demands of a modern society operating under the rule of law, as mentioned by the Court of Appeal? Yes, that was one of the objectives of the court, that they honour the rule of law, and the rule of law specifically says that everybody shall be equal before the law. That is one of the terms of the rule of law. So, any law that discriminates against any person or gender, any gender-biased law is inconsistent with the rule of law, and that was what the court said. In any modern society, when we talk about the rule of law, the cardinal number one point, everybody shall be equal before the law. Number two, you must give the other side a fair hearing, and number three is that you cannot be a judge in your own cause. The judgment of the court must be obeyed. These are the cardinals of the rule of law, and the primary cardinal is that everybody shall be equal before the law. The law does not see anybody as being superior to the other. That is what we call the rule of law. So, any law that discriminates is inconsistent with the cardinals of the rule of law, and cannot stand in any modern society. Nigeria must obey the rule of law, and Nigeria must allow its laws and the provisions of their laws to be consistent with the cardinals of the rule of law as being operated in modern societies.” What steps are expected to be taken by the respondents following this court ruling? The court specifically ordered the police force to take steps to expunge these provisions from their law, and that means the Police Service Commission and the Attorney General will take steps to expunge this from their laws.",

        "content": "REBUS is set to bring another tourist boom to Edinburgh - after the international success of the TV detective reboot. Outlander star Richard Rankin has proved to be a smash hit as a more “macho” investigating copper who takes on the capital’s underworld, after the role was originally played on ITV by John Hannah and Ken Stott. 6 Richard Rankin plays a younger version of the detective 6 Edinburgh is the setting for the dark new reboot And TV critics have been full of praise for the new series, including our own Ally Ross who described it as “superb” and like being “embraced like a long-lost friend”. VisitScotland has since seen interest soar for the BBC drama - which is also streamed around the world by Swedish streaming service Viaplay - and have now put together a list of Rebus filming locations . Chief Features Writer MATT BENDORIS takes a look at Edinburgh through the eyes of the maverick detective. GRASSMARKET THE Old Town of Edinburgh is the perfect backdrop for the new Rebus series with its twisting cobbled streets and hidden closes. READ MORE IN TV 'TEC OFF Twenty actors have played Rebus with an EastEnders legend once touted for the role SEX BAN Ian Rankin says he was banned from writing Rebus sex scenes in early books 6 Edinburgh's Grassmarket area Fittingly this was once the location for public executions, when people used to gather for open-air marketplaces and a hanging. Now the Grassmarket is a bustling spot full of independent shops , cafés and pubs that date back to the 18th century, all with epic views of Edinburgh Castle . THE MOUND AS its name suggests, The Mound is a steep hill connecting Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns, with incredible views of Princes Street and its gardens. This filming location reflects the detective’s complex character, as well as the duality of Edinburgh’s shifting landscapes.

NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND REBUS’S partner Detective Constable Siobhan Clarke (Lucie Shorthouse) is seen entering the front entrance of the library for a clandestine meeting. Rebus trailer Centrally located on George IV Bridge off the Royal Mile, the architecture of the building is impressive inside and out. The research archive date back to the 17th century and Rebus author Ian Rankin, 63, even donated his entire archive to the library. THE MEADOWS EAGLE-eyed viewers will have spotted this beautiful, open green space in the south of the city in the first episode of the new series. 6 The Meadows feature in episode one And while the detective was enjoying a secret rendezvous, visitors can instead have a drink and a snack from some of the nearby artisan coffee trucks. The Meadows also offers a chance to explore the picturesque neighbourhoods of Bruntsfield and Marchmont. GEORGE HERIOT’S SCHOOL THIS impressive building of academic prowess is where Rebus’s daughter Sammy (Mia McKenzie) goes to school . 6 There's claims the school inspired Hogwarts It’s not the first time it has been associated with fiction with Harry Potter fans claiming it also inspired J.K. Rowling’s school for wizards Hogwarts. Founded in the 1600s the best view of George Heriot’s, with its renaissance architecture, elaborate turrets and sandstone façade, is actually from Greyfriars Kirkyard. EDINBURGH CASTLE THE new series wasn’t actually filmed inside the castle walls, but the 11th century fortress acts as a backdrop throughout all six episodes . Edinburgh Castle has also been at the centre of Scottish history for over a millenia and was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. In fact research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been, “The most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world.” OXFORD BAR THIS is not only Rebus’s local, but it’s also the favourite watering hole of his creator Sir Ian Rankin. 6 The bar is also one of author Ian Rankin's haunts The 63-year-old author, who will release his 25th and possibly last Rebus book this year, has been a customer for over 30 years and once considered buying the bar on Young Street. Fans trying to contact him regularly send letters to the pub, which Ian retrieves from behind the bar whenever he pops in for a pint. ROYAL MILE RUNNING between Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse this cobblestoned road is probably the best known in the capital. Each year millions of tourists line the street to check out the good and the bad of the Edinburgh Festival street performers.

        "description": "From the Palme d’Or-winning Anora to The Surfer, starring one-man meme machine Nicolas Cage, to Emilia Pérez with Selena Gomez, 10 of the best movies unveiled at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.",
        "content": "Cannes always has moments like no other festival. The 77th edition of the world’s biggest movie marathon perhaps did not serve up enough memorable moments on screen, but there was still enough variety to excite and entertain. Here, then, is a guide to the 10 best films that were unveiled at this year’s festival. Mikey Madison is terrific as Anora, or “Ani”, a lap dancer who marries one of her clients, the spoiled son of an obscenely wealthy Russian, only to feel the full wrath of his family. Certainly, his latest will do nothing to smooth over relations; a compelling near three-hour drama, it depicts Iman (Missagh Zareh), a father of two whose work as an investigator puts him in conflict with his own family. The jury gave Rasoulof a special award; he deserved more. Some competition films will inevitably go home empty-handed, but Swedish director Magnus von Horn ( ) can count himself extremely unlucky not to take home a prize for this immaculate black-and-white period piece. Set in post-World War I Copenhagen, the shocking drama follows a young factory worker (Vic Carmen Sonne) who falls pregnant and forges a bond with a woman (Trine Dyrholm) who runs a covert adoption agency for mothers dealing with unwanted children. A horror film of sorts, highly inspired by , this was easily the most striking-looking movie in the official selection. Exploring issues of ageing, beauty and the male gaze, Fargeat won best screenplay and the hearts of Cannes audiences, who revelled in the film’s increasingly demented prosthetics and unhinged performances. While Cage has graced Cannes before with crazy films (think or ), this tale of a father who clashes with a posse of aggressive local surfers on an Australian beach required more subtleties from the actor. Engineered with a clever script that plays with perceptions of reality, this one really caught a wave. This aside, Kirill Serebrennikov’s radical account of Limonov’s life, from little-known writer to political player, still came bursting with a deeply felt energy. Rattling with Lou Reed songs, it boasts some bravura filmmaking moments, not least a whirlwind transition across the 1980s as the director spirits us to 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Certainly it cut deeper than fellow competition entry and its portrait of 70s-era Donald Trump. With lively songs by French singer Camille and equally arresting choreography by Damien Jalet, it has all the fizz of a Hollywood show-stopper, but comes armed with a social conscience too. Programmed in Director’s Fortnight, Ryan J. Sloan’s debut had the feel of early Christopher Nolan. His co-writer and wife, Ariella Mastroianni, starred as a young mother with dyschronometria, a condition that means you cannot perceive time. The result was a slow-burn noir, humming with a moody sax score from Steve Matthew Carter, that truly reels the audience into its world. The film will go down as one of those punchy indie gems – an electrician by trade, Sloan made it over two years, self-financing; and while at Cannes, he learned that the power had been cut at his and Mastroianni’s flat. What a story. A three-time Jury prizewinner, Andrea Arnold surprisingly got nothing here, but there was widespread critical admiration for her fable-like coming-of-age film set in Britain’s North Kent region. s Barry Keoghan was the big draw, playing a wayward father who even bashes out a version of Blur’s “The Universal” in one touching singalong scene. But the film spins on the relationship between his rebellious 12-year-old daughter Bailey (Nykiya Adams) and the mysterious Bird (Franz Rogowski), a curious individual who has returned to the area. Films like and are evoked as Arnold switches from social to magic realism with a deft click of her finger. His wife and long-time collaborator, Zhao Tao, is graceful as Qiaoqiao, a woman from Datong in northern China who goes on an extensive quest to find her shady boyfriend, who has left the city to seek his fortune. It is a film that captures the undulating mood of a nation.",

        "content": "During this call, the victim urgently requested his bank card, an indication that the suspects' intentions might have included financial extortion. On a Thursday night in Ginsberg, Eastern Cape, an unsettling event transpired involving a recent recipient of the Road Accident Fund (RAF). The victim, while escorting his girlfriend from his homestead to her residence, was suddenly confronted by suspects in a white VW Polo. The suspects discharged two warning shots into the air, causing immediate panic and confusion. In the ensuing chaos, the couple was forcibly shoved into the vehicle by the assailants, who then made a hasty escape towards the local graveyard. As the night progressed, the victim managed to make a distress call to his brother from a location near Man’s Tavern in King William’s Town. During this call, the victim urgently requested his bank card, an indication that the suspects’ intentions might have included financial extortion. The brother, demonstrating quick thinking and composure, immediately alerted the authorities about the dire situation. The police responded swiftly by deploying a rapid response team to track and intercept the suspects. The coordinated efforts and the resultant pressure applied by law enforcement officers caused the suspects to lose their nerve. Faced with the imminent threat of capture, the suspects abandoned their plan, allowing the victims to escape unscathed and without any money being withdrawn from the victim’s account. The swift action taken by the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation, commonly known as the Hawks, led to the apprehension of four suspects aged between 33 and 45, following the recent kidnapping incident in Ginsberg. These suspects are scheduled to appear in King William’s Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Captain Yolisa Mgolodela, the Eastern Cape Hawks spokesperson, provided an account of the incident, highlighting the prompt response and subsequent arrests. Major General Mboiki Obed Ngwenya, the provincial head of the Hawks, commended the collaborative effort of the team that facilitated the safe release of the victim. He praised the combined forces’ efficiency in ensuring that the suspects were apprehended without any ransom being paid. The rapid response by law enforcement highlighted their capability to thwart the suspects’ plans and secure the safety of the victims.",

Cockerel flies through window into woman's car as she's driving before refusing to leave and eating her shopping Brazen bird Barry even leapt on the steering wheel of Jessica Matthews's Ford Ka By Sam Lawley Published: 19:07, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:29, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments This is the hilarious moment a cockerel flies through a window into a woman's car as she's driving before refusing to leave and eating her shopping. Jessica Matthews was making her way home along a country road in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, when the lone bird darted into her Ford Ka and made itself comfortable. The pesky rooster, nicknamed Barry, then decided to tuck in to the driver's shopping as she tried to usher the animal out. Now footage has emerged of the amusing incident which sees the lost cockerel clinging to Ms Matthews' window, inside her car and even perched on her shoulder. To the driver's amazement, the bird first appears sitting in the window of the parked car, seemingly unsure whether to enter. Jessica Matthews (pictured) was making her way home along a country road in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, when the lone bird darted into her Ford Ka and made itself comfortable. The driver then took the cockerel home before finding a new owner for it The bird, nicknamed Barry, pictured entering Ms Matthews's car.

Pet parrots prefer live video calls with their friends over pre-recorded footage, study finds The camera pans to show the picturesque but quiet country lane where the two crossed paths. With light fading first, Ms Matthews starts driving around the local area to try to find who Barry belongs to. By now, the cockerel has made itself very comfortable on the passenger seat, showing little interest of returning to the great outdoors. Soon it is pitch black outside and Ms Matthews realises time is running out to sort a place for Barry to stay for the night. The driver makes a last gasp attempt to lure the cockerel, who has laid droppings all over the inside of the vehicle, back into the wild using raspberries and pecan nuts. Holding the animal in her lap, Ms Matthews accepts there is no option but to take the bird home, despite her having five cats as pets, and in the next clips Barry can be seen sitting on her shoulder and eating some food. The shocked driver said: 'He just didn't want to get out of the car. 'I was trying to nudge it out the car and then the next thing I know he's sat on the passenger seat. 'I was thinking OK, well it looks like I now have a chicken. Barry pictured tucking into a snack.

Ms Matthews has since decided to rescue the bird, risking the wrath of her boyfriend by bringing it home, before eventually finding a new home for the cockerel. In one clip, she gave an update, saying: 'So he doesn't belong to the people on the farm, nobody is answering there, so we are now going to see if we can find if he lives up here.

        "content": "A TRAIN driver did all he could when he saw two women walking towards him on the track, Sligo Coroner’s Court has heard. Padraig O’Gara blew the horn and applied the emergency brakes after seeing the pair “in the middle of the track”. Mum-of-four Jessica McLoughlin , 40, of Rusheen Ard, Caltragh Co Sligo, sustained fatal injuries after she and her niece, Rebecca Leydon, 26, were involved in a collision with a Sligo to Dublin train near Ballisodare on 14 June 2023. In a statement, Ms Leydon told the coroner that the pair had been walking the track after getting off a train in Collooney after realising she had left her phone in a shop in Sligo. She said they had been walking back to Sligo on the train line and did not realise there was a train due, adding: “I feel guilty about it.” Ms Leydon said they heard the train horn, adding: “When I looked I didn’t think it was going to hit us but it was the steps that hit us. “I broke my leg and got staples in two spots.” Mr O’Gara said in his statement that he was driving the 3.05pm train from Dublin to Sligo at the time of the incident. He recalled seeing the two women in the distance in the middle of the track walking towards him after he passed over the Ballisodare water bridge. He said: “I blew the horn and applied the train brakes to the emergency position,” he said, adding that the two moved to the side of the track. “One lady jumped clear. The other lady didn’t. “She stood on the outside of the rail track while still standing on the track.” He said this woman was “crouched forward”. “I continued to blow the train horn as I knew she wasn’t clear. She collided with the side of the train.” His colleague, ticket inspector Greg Flanagan, told the coroner in a statement that the emergency brakes were applied just after Ballisodare. Initially, Ms McLoughlin had a pulse and paramedics treated the wound but she went into cardiac arrest with a doctor pronouncing her dead at the scene at 4.28pm. An autopsy showed that Ms McLoughlin had sustained multiple injuries in the collision. The coroner’s court heard that toxicology tests showed the presence of alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs in her system. Coroner Eamonn MacGowan recorded a narrative verdict that Ms McLoughlin had died on the railway line from injuries sustained in a collision with a train, against a background of alcohol and drug intoxication.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,\" Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers' series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. \"Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers , Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. \"It’s getting better day by day. It's definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn't run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. \"Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn't play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,\" he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He's not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,\" Ohtani said. ”So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.\" He hasn't concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn't pitching. “It's hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,\" he said. ”I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.\" AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",

        "content": "Chloe Sevigny puts on a VERY leggy display in black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day weekend with family in SoHo By Deirdre Durkan-simonds For Dailymail.com Published: 20:49, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:14, 27 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments Chloe Sevigny showcased her incredibly toned legs in a pair of tiny black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day Weekend with her family. As she stepped out with her husband, Siniša Mačković, and their son, Vanja, four, in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, the 49-year-old actress appeared in high spirits as she strutted down the sidewalk in a pair of black Birkenstocks. For their laid-back outing, the Golden Globe winner wore a white criss-cross top, a floral crossbody purse, calf-length socks and oversized black shades. As her spouse pushed their tot's stroller, Vanja could be seen sweetly holding onto his mother's hand. Mačković, who works as the director of Karma Art Gallery in New York City , wore a light blue button-down over a white t-shirt and jeans. Chloe Sevigny showcased her incredibly toned legs in a pair of tiny black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day Weekend with her family The couple's little boy wore a bright red graphic t-shirt and matching shorts. Sevigny married her husband Siniša Mačković in May of 2020 in a secret ceremony in New York's City Hall. Less than two months later, they welcomed their son. Two years after their marriage, they celebrated with their loved ones by throwing a bash in Darien, Connecticut, where the Big Love alumna grew up. According to Vogue , the pair was introduced through a mutual friend but did not meet in person until they crossed paths later at a Gagosian opening. They saw each other at social settings various times before they started dating. When they found out they were expecting, Sevigny and Mačković celebrated with a couple's getaway in Turks and Caicos. It was there her now-husband proposed and, shortly thereafter, the couple eloped in New York City. As she stepped out with her husband, Siniša Mačković, and their son, Vanja, four, in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, the 49-year-old actress appeared in high spirits as she strutted down the sidewalk in a pair of black Birkenstocks Sevigny is best known for her role as Nicolette Grant on the HBO series Big Love, which she starred on from 2006 to 2011 (seen in March 2024) Though Sevigny has chosen to keep many details about her family life private, she did open up to The Cut ahead of her son's arrival, talking about when she learned her child's gender. 'When I found out I was having a boy, I had to wrap my head around that, as I am so girly. I don't even have that many boy friends; all of my friends are girls. I just relate better to girls. I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with a boy?' she shared. Despite her initial hesitation, she shared that she was 'thrilled and so excited about the whole thing.' Sevigny previously admitted that their pregnancy was not planned in an interview with LA Magazine in 2020, saying 'It was a real shocker. This was an accident. I didn't think I'd ever have kids. I just acquiesced that it was not going to happen for me.' Sevigny is best known for her role as Nicolette Grant on the HBO series Big Love, which she starred on from 2006 to 2011. Over her career, she's won a Golden Globe, Satellite Award and Independent Spirit Award. Additionally, she's been nominated for an Oscar and three SAG Awards.

Two search and rescue helicopters and a plane were sent to the scene alongside the RNLI's all weather lifeboat and one independent lifeboat. A cross-Channel ferry, Commodore Goodwill, also appeared to be assisting with the search. The woman was safely winched to safety out of the water by a Coastguard helicopter at about 4pm on Thursday, HM Coastguard told MailOnline. This is a breaking news story. More to follow.

        "content": "ASHBURN, Va. ( DC News Now ) — ESPN said Monday that the Washington Commanders’ new kicker faces allegations of sexual assault that supposedly took place during his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. ESPN said two women filed a lawsuit in Duval County Circuit Civil Court, accusing Brandon McManus of assaulting them. The report said the women also claim the Jaguars didn’t “create a safe environment” for staff members who serve the football team. The women asked for $1 million and a jury trial. A spokesman for the Washington Commanders provided DC News Now with the following statement Monday: Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Labour Party sacks Edo excos, inaugurates caretaker committee Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Politics Labour Party sacks Edo excos, inaugurates caretaker committee Published on May 27, 2024 By Enahoro Iyemefokhai The crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the Labour Party ahead of the September 21, 2024, governorship election remains unabated as the Julius Abure-led national leadership of the party sacked the state executive led by Kelly Ogbaloi. DAILY POST reports that the national leadership then appointed Elizabeth Ativie, the former Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, as the head of a 17-man caretaker committee. The deputy national chairman of the party, Dr Ayo Olorunfemi, inaugurated the committee on Monday in a hotel in Benin City. Olorunfemi, also named Ken Omusi, the suspended state youth leader of the party, who had earlier in the month purportedly sacked the state executives and appointed himself the acting chairman, a member of the committee. While inaugurating the committee, Olorunfemi said the new leadership of the party in the state came on board due to the expiration of the tenure of the Ogbaloi-led executive council, which ended in April 2024. He said the caretaker committee is expected to take charge of the affairs of the party until a fresh congress is conducted to elect a new executive. He said Mrs Elizabeth Ativie was appointed as chairman of the committee due to her positive and result-oriented track records so far in all her political positions. He called for unity in the party and assured that the party would be more united in Edo State with the Ativie-led committee. In her acceptance remarks, the acting chairman of the party, Mrs Elizabeth Ativie, who commended the national leadership of the party for finding her worthy of the position, promised to move the party to a higher level in the state. Ativie, who also promised to reconcile all aggrieved members of the party, added that a reconciliation team would be set up to resolve all pending issues. When contacted, the embattled Kelly Ogbaloi, the sacked chairman of the party, said his executives are not aware of any changes in leadership in the state. According to him: “We are not aware that the Edo State Labour Party executive has been dissolved because there is a process to all of these. No one man can just wake up one day and remove a structure that has been in existence. “The National Working Committee of the party, led then by Julius Abure, reached an agreement that there would be no congress in Edo State until after the governorship election slated for September 21, 2024. “It was agreed that the exco should be allowed to prosecute the state election, after which Congress can follow.” DAILY POST recalls that last Friday, the Kelly Ogbaloi-led state executive suspended Julius Abure as the national chairman of the party. Meanwhile, a letter signed by Julius Abure said the new executives of the party are expected to work in conjunction with the party’s governorship candidate, Olumide Akapata, towards ensuring victory at the governorship election.

        "content": "There are two sugar substitutes that I can beat my chest about their benefits and their zero-calorie status. They are stevia and monk fruit. I will talk about them later. This week, I would like us to familiarize ourselves with the various sugar substitutes that people use. I will give my thoughts about them. There are a few reasons that sugar substitutes may be a healthier choice than regular sugar: Some are low-calorie or calorie-free, which can be helpful for people who want to lose weight. Most have a lower glycaemic index, which helps reduce blood sugar spikes and provides the body with a lower and steadier sugar load. If the substitute is a whole fruit, it can be a source of fibre. They can provide a depth of flavour that you do not get with refined sugar. Let us see some of these substitutes: Allulose It is promoted as a natural sweetener because it is found in nature in jackfruit, figs, raisins, kiwis, dried fruits, maple syrup, and molasses. It is considered a rare sugar because it is found in very small quantities. It is added to many packaged foods. However, to be produced allulose is not isolated from those sources, most commercially available allulose is synthetically made from corn. Certain sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols do not contain ethanol. Currently, eight sugar alcohols are approved for human consumption, they are erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, isomalt, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Of these, xylitol, erythritol, and maltitol are the most widely used in the food industry. Some sugar alcohols can be found in whole foods. Pineapples, olives, asparagus, sweet potatoes, and carrots are natural sources of mannitol; cereals, mushrooms, and some fruits and vegetables contain xylitol; and various fruits like apples, pears, blackberries, peaches, and prunes contain sorbitol. But the sugar alcohols often present in packaged products like sugar-free candies, gums, chocolate, energy bars, cookies, energy drinks, cough syrups, throat lozenges, and toothpaste are synthetically produced. Agave Agave syrup comes from the sap of the agave plant. The plant is first cut and pressed to extract the sugary sap. While this sap is high in sugar, it also contains healthy fibres like fructans, which are linked to beneficial effects on metabolism and insulin. Honey Honey is one of the oldest natural sweeteners and has been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times. Honey, like all carbohydrates, raises blood sugar quickly, but not quite as fast as sugar. As with any sweetener, honey is best consumed in moderation. Syrups Syrups are thick liquid sweeteners often made from plants or fruits. Maple and date syrups are popular varieties. They have about the same amount of calories as sugar and will increase blood sugar by about the same amount. Blackstrap molasses Molasses is thick, dark syrup made by processing sugarcane. Blackstrap molasses is especially thick and contains more nutrients than regular molasses or sugar. It is high in calories and slightly less sweet than sugar. Jaggery Typically used in Asia and Africa, jaggery is a sweetener made from the juices of sugarcane. It is an unrefined form of sugar, so it retains vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine to help with cough, digestion issues, and other illnesses. Coconut sugar Coconut sugar is also called coconut palm sugar. A cut is made on the flower of the coconut palm, and the liquid sap is collected into containers. The sap is placed under heat until most of the water has evaporated. The end product is brown and granulated. Its colour is similar to that of raw cane sugar, but the particle size is typically smaller or more variable. Applesauce Apple cooked into a puree makes applesauce. Compared to sugar, applesauce is a low-calorie alternative. It contains fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Applesauce will not increase blood sugar as much as regular sugar does. Bananas and other whole fruits Fruits are nature’s candy. You can use them as a sweetener in foods like plain yogurt, pancakes, and baked goods. They also blend nicely into smoothies and juices. Along with their sweetness and flavour, fruits pack in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. If you use whole fruit, you will also benefit from a healthy fibre load. The fibre content can help curb blood sugar spikes compared to regular sugar. An NIH-funded research team led by Dr. Stanley Hazen at the Cleveland Clinic examined the relationship between erythritol and heart attacks and stroke. According to Dr. Stanley Hazen, “sweeteners like erythritol have rapidly increased in popularity in recent years, but there needs to be more in-depth research into their long-term effects. Cardiovascular disease builds over time and heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. We need to make sure the foods we eat aren’t hidden contributors.” According to Francesco Branca, WHO Director for Nutrition and Food Safety “Replacing free sugars with NSS (non-sugar sweeteners) does not help with weight control in the long term. People need to consider other ways to reduce free sugar intake, such as consuming food with naturally occurring sugars, like fruit, or unsweetened food and beverages. NSS are not essential dietary factors and have no nutritional value. People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether, starting early in life, to improve their health” I would like to give my thoughts on these sweeteners. Let me use agave nectar/syrup as an example. It is produced from the sap of a plant that has been used medicinally in Mexico for generations. Although all-natural agave sweeteners may be healthier for you than regular sugar, most of the agave you buy in stores is highly processed. When processed into a syrup, the fructans are extracted and broken down into fructose by exposing the sap to heat and/or enzymes. This process, which is similar to how other unhealthy sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup are made, destroys all of the health-promoting properties of the agave plant. Therefore, it is not atypical that a bottle of agave has more high fructose corn syrup in it than any other commercial sweetener including high fructose corn syrup itself. Because agave syrup is much higher in fructose( not the fructose in whole fruits) than plain sugar, it has a greater potential to cause adverse health effects, such as increased belly fat and fatty liver disease. Let us see another shocking revelation. There is a big difference between the stevia you buy at the grocery store and the stevia you may grow at home. Stevia products found on grocery store shelves, such as Truvia and Stevia in the Raw, do not contain whole stevia leaf. They are made from a highly refined stevia leaf extract called rebaudioside A (Reb-A). Many stevia products have very little stevia in them at all. So, you can now see that processing is a major problem, it can turn a natural and safe sweetener to diseases- causing one. So, let your sugar substitutes be naturally occurring sugars in fruits and veggies and they must be prepared in your home and not store-bought.",

        "content": "SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council intends to open a professional gymnastics academy center at Gindun Rajbagh Srinagar, following the pattern of the gymnastics academy center in Jammu, with the objective of promoting gymnastics as a major sport in the Kashmir region. At first, talent scouting and camps will be organised to impart gymnastics coaching in the Kashmir division followed by in-house competitions. Parents and kids are responding reasonably well to the coaching camp that is being organized currently. Over the next few months, more such camps will be conducted in both North and South Kashmir. According to Secretary JKSC Nuzhat Gul, the center will feature world class facilities for the athletes. “The aim is to attract the attention of aspiring athletes from the Kashmir region who want to pursue gymnastics professionally and take advantage of the Sports Policy benefits, which include financial awards, admissions in professional colleges under sports quotas, job prospects under SO12, and much more” she added. In an endeavor of this kind, JKSC, with the assistance of Manish Gupta, a well-known gymnastics coach, has organized a summer coaching camp at SKISC Srinagar. Over the years, notable accomplishments in gymnastics have been made possible by the Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council. Thanks to the Government of J&K for providing state-of-the-art gymnastics facilities established at M A Stadium. Gymnasts’ medal tallies have increased yearly at both the national and international levels. In 2018, the J&K Sports Council launched the Gymnastics Academy in Jammu. Based on J&K gymnasts’ achievements in the Khelo India Games and other national championships, this training center was chosen as a recognized Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy by the Sports Authority of India (the only Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy in India). Later in 2020, this academy was outfitted with world class gymnastics apparatuses and equipment, enabling J&K gymnasts to perform better in both national and international competitions and win various awards for J&K. With the help of these state-of-the-art facilities, J&K gymnasts have represented the country in major international competitions such as the Asian Championships, World Cups, and Commonwealth Games. Muskan Rana and Bavleen Kaur, both Academy trainees, have won gold for J&K and the Best Gymnasts of India titles in the Khelo India Games 2021 and 2022. The Junior National Team Championship was won by Muskan Rana, Manya, Vabhavi Sharma, and Jagriti Thakur. In both national and international competitions, such as the World and Asian Championships, J&K gymnasts have improved, won numerous medals, and displayed outstanding performance. Since 2021, J&K has yielded incredibly successful results in gymnastics. Over the last three years, 13 gymnasts have competed for their country in international competitions and have won almost 80 medals, including 25 Gold, 34 silver, and 21 bronze at national games and other major championships. These successes demonstrate the commitment of the athletes and their coaches supported by JKSC.

        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — The Parker Lake wildfire near Fort Nelson, B.C., is now classified as \"being held\" as residents start returning home, more than two weeks after the fire forced thousands to evacuate the community. The BC Wildfire Service says rain on Sunday and the efforts of firefighters mean the 123-square-kilometre fire in the northeast corner of the province is not expected to grow. But the blaze hasn't been extinguished and the service says it expects parts of it to continue burning into the fall. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded evacuation orders at 8 a.m., lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home, 17 days after they were ordered to flee. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" — By Ashley Joannou in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

Coldplay fan Saundra Glenn (right), 64, was left in utter shock when frontman Chris Martin gave her a lift into BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Luton last week Saundra Glenn, who has osteoarthritis and problems in her hip, knee and ankle, nearly went home after she was struggling to walk to the accessibility box office at the entrance of the festival - until Coldplay's Chris (pictured) came to the rescue Saundra was then escorted into the festival by Chris, who talked with her about 'all kinds of things' including her work in the local community in Luton. She added: 'He said \"It's lovely to hear about what you do\". 'I said \"I'm 65 this summer\", he said \"You don't look it\" and not to worry about age and just to keep doing what I'm doing. 'He seems like a totally decent human being and I told him that... I said \"You're just a very nice person\".' Saundra even took the opportunity to capture the moment with a quick selfie of her and Chris. Coldplay played a new song called Orange during their set in tribute to Luton Town FC after a public campaign by fans, so the band played a new song celebrating the local club. Saundra added: 'He told me he's going to do something special at the end - I said \"Go on are you changing yellow to orange?\" 'He said, \"I can't tell you that, but I can say, wait til the end - I'm doing something special, and that was special\".'

He goes: \"Yes you can, just come on in\" Saundra was then escorted into the festival by Chris, who talked with her about 'all kinds of things' including her work in the local community in Luton Coldplay played a new song called Orange during their set in tribute to Luton Town FC after a public campaign by fans, so the band played a new song celebrating the local club Chris had to jump out of the vehicle before Saundra, but when he got to his destination he told staff to get into a buggy with her and escort her all the way to her destination at the festival's accessible area. Saundra said: 'They didn't leave me until I had my wristband on - that's how dedicated they were. I got onto the stage area where you can sit and I saw Coldplay's set - it was a fantastic experience last night, it's the best thing I've done in a long, long time.' 'He's shown that kindness rules the world. Be more Chris Martin.'

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Cricket, a popular pastime in the United States in the mid 1800s, makes a big-ticket return to North American shores through the T20 Word Cup but will it be able to leave an impression on the local audience that knows little to nothing about the gentleman’s game? Cricket globally is driven by India but the International Cricket Council sees huge potential in the American market and claims there are already 30 million fans that follow the game in the massive country. The T20 showpiece is also seen as a major stepping stone to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make a comeback after 128 years when the big event kicks off on June 1. A total of 16 games will be played across three venues New York, Dallas and Lauderhill with a majority of 55 matches scheduled in the Caribbean including the knock-outs. Day three of the competition will have South Africa and Sri Lanka battling it out in New York, where the first ever international cricket game was held between USA and Canada back in 1844. It was a phase when the sport was played widely across America before a much faster alternative in Baseball gained prominence during the Civil War in the 1860s. “... it’s entertainment and that’s what people look for. That’s what Americans look for, you know, they want entertainment,” says legendary West Indian Brian Lara, one of the most recognisable cricketers in the world but someone who admits that he could walk around Miami without getting a second look. “You know, you speak to an American and I’ve done that many times and they’d say ‘you play a game for five days and then you end up in a draw? What’s that all about?’ So it’s, it is difficult,” he explains the challenge of selling Test cricket to an American, who might just warm up to the shortest format though. A couple of weeks of international cricket in an alien land will not be enough to evoke long-lasting interest from the local audience and to ensure the game grows beyond the South Asian and Caribbean expat community, the stakeholders will need more time. For a beginner, cricket can be rather complex to understand especially when one is introduced to “third man”, “fine leg” or “deep mid-wicket”, some of the terms used for the many field placements in the game. The ICC is pulling out all stops to engage with the American audience, whether it is getting eight-time Olympic gold-winning sprinter Usain Bolt on board as the World Cup ambassador or promoting the event at the recent Formula 1 race in Miami. To distract the average American household from the world of baseball, NFL and NBA, cricket will need to grow at the grassroots level. “I surely think the game can grow in the USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about,” Bolt, who belongs to the cricket-loving Caribbean, told PTI in a recent interview. The Americans have surely one reason to follow the event. Their team, mainly made up of players from South Asian and Caribbean heritage, will be making its World Cup debut. Venu Pisike, head of USA Cricket, reckons the ICC event will bring much-needed awareness around the game but eventually, it is the lure of taking part in the 2028 Olympics that will draw masses to the sport. “So far, cricket is predominantly an expats’ game, but with the marketing and promotion activities during the World Cup, there is some momentum and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the USA,” said Pisike. “Definitely, the World Cup is bringing a lot of awareness and then the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics, that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country. “Olympics is the prime area where all the sports bodies are focusing on since cricket is going to Olympics, that will actually give more opportunities to expand the sport between the World Cup and the Olympics,” added Pisike. The USA squad picked for the tournament makes up for a bunch of semi-professionals who rely on full-time jobs to run their families. That will have to change if the sport is to appeal to a broader audience in America, believes India-born USA squad member Nisarg Patel. “Ultimately what needs to change in the USA is that an American kid in a high school needs to see a future in the game. There are so many sports in America, the country is built on Olympic medals. “For cricket to succeed, we need to show them there is a career out of playing cricket,” said the spinner, who works full-time with a medical research company in Los Angeles. The start of Major League Cricket last year, the sport’s first professional league in the country, was a big step in that direction. However, to capture the imagination of people in a country with an already crowded and developed sporting landscape, would be a gargantuan challenge for the ICC and other stakeholders.

        "content": "Fans accuse THAT security guard at Cannes Film Festival of chasing '15 minutes of fame' after clashing with Kelly Rowland, Yoona and Massiel Taveras By Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Codie Bullen For Mailonline Published: 13:41 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:12 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 190 shares 73 View comments Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France , has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women.' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over how the minder was seemingly only 'aggressive with women of color.' Another wrote: 'This lady is a STRAIGHT up HATER... first Kelly Rowland and NOW Massiel Taveras........ she needs to be TERMINATED.' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote. 'It's seems such a coincidence that it is always the same security guard that is giving the same issue. The job does not require them to become the news unless they are doing on purpose... #15Secondsoffame.' Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France, has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet (seen last week in a heated discussion with singer Kelly Ro)wland 'Like seriously why is @Festival_Cannes allowing their crazy security guards to tackle & harass guests like this?' a fourth asked. 'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet.' A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event.' 'This Cannes film festival security guard needs a pay raise asap,' one X user suggested. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos. The K-pop star-turned-actress, 33, was preparing to pose for pictures on the iconic red stairs when she was stopped by the security guard. The incident came just days after the same guard was scolded by Rowland on the red carpet, which the Destiny's Child implied was due to racism while the staffer's colleagues insisted she was 'only doing her job.' Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over seemingly being 'aggressive with women of color' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote.

'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet' Another shared a meme of a priest getting tackled, which they compared to the security guard blocking celebrities from posing Some pointed out that the guard only seemed to be acting 'aggressive with women of color' 'Needs to be fire,' another tweeted A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event' Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before. The Dominican actress was on the red carpet on Saturday afternoon preparing to unfurl a huge gown with a depiction of Jesus on it, but appeared surprised to be stopped by the security guard. Footage of the spat showed Taveras defy instructions and throw the train of her dress down the stairs, before the situation escalated to the actress shoving the female security guard as she walked into the event. In the video of Taveras' confrontation, the actress seemed to plan to unravel her huge train down the steps, but was quickly stopped by the female security guard sticking out her arm. As other staffers helped lay out the dress while Taveras waved to fans, she grew angry as the security guard kept her arm out in front of her posing. The two exchanged a few words on the red carpet as staff pulled the train up the stairs, before Taveras took the end of the dress from another guard and threw it to the floor in frustration. The female security guard kept her arm close to Taveras as she escorted her up the stairs, although it is unclear what the reason was for the guard to tail her so closely. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs When she reached the top of the stairs, Taveras - who was previously crowned Miss Dominican Republic and competed at Miss Universe - struggled to unfurl the train of her dress. This led her to berate the security guard when she tried to step in, throwing her arms up in frustration. After the dress finally disentangled, Taveras waved to her fans - but the female security guard kept her arm across the actress, and appeared to jostle her towards the entrance. That move sparked an angry reaction from Taveras as she shoved the security guard away from her, before sticking up her finger and scowling at her. It is unclear why Taveras was confronted by the security guard, three days after the staffer also raised eyebrows with her spat with Rowland. The singer expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted. She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' However, colleagues of the security guard at the center of the Cannes spotlight insisted to DailyMail.com that she was acting appropriately and was 'only doing her job.' 'She was an usher working under a lot of pressure to keep people on the carpet moving, so as to stop crowds building up,' said a Festival staff veteran, who has been working in the resort every May for 20 years. 'There was no pushing or shoving, or scolding,' he said. 'Security and safety are the priorities, along with keeping to strict timetables set according to contracts – even the celebrities have to stick to the rules. 'Lots of ushers are involved, and they always act professionally and with politeness. 'In this case, the usher was certainly only doing her job – she didn't do anything wrong.' Rowland expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' The usher has not been publicly identified, but she is known to be a local Frenchwoman on a short term contract with the week-long Festival. The source added: 'Suggestions of racism are just ridiculous – visitors, and indeed staff at Cannes come from all kinds of backgrounds, and none are discriminated against.' After footage of Rowland berating the staffer went viral, a lip-reading expert revealed what Kelly really said during the heated interaction with the French woman. Jacqui Press told MailOnline that after the security guard appeared to step on her dress, she apologized and Kelly said: 'It's OK.' However, the security guard then said something else, causing Kelly's change in mood, as she responded: 'Don't talk to me like that.' As the security guard continued to usher her up the stairs, Kelly turned around and repeated the phrase several times.

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

Can the Emoluments Committee clarify what work they’ve achieved for the nation that they consider themselves worthy of such a huge raise? In the pay and allowances already received, how is that insufficient for their presence in carrying out their professional duties? These people who, at some point in time, claim to be the voice, stand up, and work for the people seem to lose allegiance towards nation-building. The parliamentary pay rise is not a pack of salt. You can make claims off the cuff when members themselves are speaking of financial and economic difficulties in carrying out nation-wide development due to the recession, past Government financial mismanagement, etc. So please try and raise the living standards of the people you all represent before selfishly quenching your own thirst. These politicians who claim to put Fiji and its people first from day one of advertising themselves until they are elected—may we ask how and when? Is it through self-progress, national regress, or neglect? Those who support this call openly or silently showcase their choice of selfishness. Double-faced coins are never useful, so the public needs to be aware of their selection in every election. Feedback: letters@fijisun.com.fj",

        "description": "Along with British and Irish convicts, 627 free men, women and children were transported to the 19th-century penal colonies of Van Diemen’s Land. Their stories, mostly forgotten, are moving.",
        "content": "Emma Cotton (or Cotterell) sailed into Sydney harbour on the Rubicon in 1833 as a free immigrant. A 32-year-old woman of independent means, she took on needlework in the colony. Emma’s genteel life unravelled four years later when she appeared before a Sydney court charged with stealing a bundle of “wearing apparel”. Emma was transported to Van Diemen’s Land ( lutruwita or Tasmania) for seven years, then spent the rest of her life in Hobart. After her sudden death in February 1863, a local newspaper reported she was “better known as old Emma the fortune teller”. If Emma had been able to foretell her own future, she may have chosen to stay in London. Conditions for convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were tough. Food was rationed. Many prisoners spent time in penal stations such as Port Arthur, female houses of correction known as “female factories” , probation stations, where convicts were required to serve the initial period of their sentences, or asylums. A prison for boys, Point Puer, was built next to Port Arthur. Some men laboured on road gangs. Women often worked in colonists’ homes as domestic servants. Emma was assigned to work at the Police Magistrate’s office. She also did time, probably at the infamous wash tubs at the Cascades Female Factory in South Hobart. Details of Emma’s case were carefully captured in a convict indent register. Now known as CON16, five of these rectangular registers with their spidery handwriting and tatty bindings survive. Among the many named in them are 627 men, women and children who arrived free or were born free in the Australian colonies but became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land. Their stories have, until now, mostly been forgotten. They challenge popular narratives of Australian history suggesting only convicts from Britain and Ireland were transported to Van Diemen’s Land. The youngest prisoner, a boy called Joseph Levy, was just ten when transported for perjury. The oldest was a 75-year-old man who laboured on a road gang. As well as Indigenous convicts from the Cape colony (now part of South Africa) and New Zealand, more than 60 Aboriginal men from mainland Australia were transported as convicts during the 19th-century frontier wars. In the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (now Victoria), some Aboriginal warriors engaged in economic sabotage. Yanem Goona, also known as “Old Man Billy Billy”, was thought to be a ringleader. When a large flock of sheep was driven off a station near Mt Arapiles in 1845, a white-led Native Police contingent tracked the missing animals, locating around 200 sheep in a “bush yard” built by local Aboriginal people. Yanem Goona was arrested, tried and sentenced to ten years’ transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. When serving his initial probationary period at Norfolk Island , a visitor noted how the old man cried whenever he thought of home. After being shipped to Van Diemen’s Land, Yanem Goona died in custody at the Impression Bay probation station on October 31 1848. Of these 627 people named and detailed in the register, 276 were sentenced in NSW. Forty-five went through the South Australian law courts, 29 were shipped from Victoria, and 19 from Western Australia. Within Van Diemen’s Land itself, 247 free people were sentenced to transportation and sent to Port Arthur and other convict establishments. The overwhelming majority, more than 88%, were male. The first entry in the register is for Thomas Carroll, an Englishman who arrived free in Launceston in November 1831. Carroll opened a livery stables, advertising horses and gigs for hire, and his services breaking in fillies and colts. After moving to Hobart and working as a groom, Carroll was found guilty of stealing a saddle and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He was sent to work on a road gang a few miles from Hobart. Peter Haley (or Caley) was a groom in Adelaide before being sentenced to transportation for ten years for horse stealing. Born near Cape Town, Haley was a Khoisan man who arrived free in Sydney in 1839. By 1850 he had become a notorious horse thief. The following year he was transported to Van Diemen’s Land where he served 15 months at Cascades probation station before being sent into service at New Norfolk, a rural area located inland from Hobart. As a convict labourer, he continued to steal horses. His sentence was extended to transportation for life. Ultimately, Haley absconded, joined a gang of bush-rangers, and was nicknamed “Black Peter”. Eventually the gang was captured, tried and executed. Haley was hanged in Hobart in February 1859 alongside one of his friends. Not all formerly free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were sentenced to transportation. Occasionally their sentence was “death recorded”, meaning they were sentenced to death with an immediate reprieve, then transported instead. Such was the case for Dola, a southeast Asian sailor found guilty in Adelaide of attempted murder on the high seas. When he and seven other convicts were sent to Hobart in June 1851 on the brig Union, the Adelaide Observer announced their departure under the headline “A Good Riddance”. The median age of these convicts was 42.5 years – much higher than today’s median age of 31 years for offenders . Only 10% were under the age of 20. However, there were some outliers. Joseph Levy appeared before the Berrima Circuit Court in NSW in September 1841, aged ten. One of six children from a Catholic family living at Blacktown, Joseph was a key witness in a case involving an alleged horse-stabbing. Levy told the court the horse’s owner had promised him a cow and a calf if the boy said he had witnessed the attack. However, he hadn’t seen anything. Levy was charged with perjury then transported to Van Diemen’s Land for seven years. While incarcerated at Point Puer, a facility for boys, Levy was punished many times. He received a total of 83 “stripes on the breech” and spent 61 days in solitary confinement. When his sentence expired in 1848, Levy was sent back to NSW. Michael Caffray, meanwhile, was a carpenter from Dublin who came out to Van Diemen’s Land as a free migrant. He was 75 when tried in Hobart in 1836 for receiving 40 pounds of stolen mutton and sentenced to transportation for 14 years. Caffray laboured on the Grass Tree Hill road gang on the outskirts of Hobart while under sentence. He died in 1854 from paralysis at Impression Bay on the Tasman Peninsula. Violent interpersonal crimes (murder, manslaughter, rape and assault) account for only 8% of cases resulting in transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. Some crimes, such as larceny, burglary, housebreaking, robbery and stealing from a person (49.5% of cases), are not unexpected. Stealing animals (cattle, horses and sheep) also figure frequently (12.3% of cases). However, offences we view as white collar crimes, which don’t attract lengthy prison sentences today, figure quite often. These include forgery, embezzlement, and fraud and false pretences. Various bigamists, arsonists, military absconders and offenders, perjurers and those convicted of “unnatural offences” also lost their freedom. Convicts who offended while serving their sentences received further punishments. All the free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land had something in common. The activities they engaged in were criminalised, and they were seen as bad characters. Those who survived the system were viewed as “tainted” within their own lifetimes. But the criminal deportation of these formerly free people tells us more about colonial Australian attitudes and values than it does about the individuals themselves.",

        "description": "The Mona Lisa has traditionally been associated with Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. But there’s plenty of evidence pointing to a different identity.",
        "content": "In the pantheon of Renaissance art, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa stands as an unrivalled icon. This half-length portrait is more than just an artistic masterpiece; it embodies the allure of an era marked by unparalleled cultural flourishing. Yet, beneath the surface of the Mona Lisa’s elusive smile lies a debate that touches the very essence of the Renaissance, its politics and the role of women in history. The intrigue of the Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda , isn’t solely due to Leonardo’s revolutionary painting techniques. It’s also because the identity of the subject is unconfirmed to this day. More than half a century since it was first painted, the real identity of the Mona Lisa remains one of art’s greatest mysteries, intriguing scholars and enthusiasts alike. The painting has traditionally been associated with Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. But another compelling theory suggests a different sitter: Isabella of Aragon. Isabella of Aragon was born into the illustrious House of Aragon in Naples, in 1470. She was a princess who was deeply entwined in the political and cultural fabric of the Renaissance. Her 1490 marriage to Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, positioned Isabella at the heart of Italian politics. And this role was both complicated and elevated by the ambitions and machinations of Ludovico Sforza (also called Ludovico il Moro), her husband’s uncle and usurper of the Milanese dukedom. The theory that Isabella is the real Mona Lisa is supported by a combination of stylistic analyses, historical connections and reinterpretations of Leonardo’s intent as an artist. In his biography of Leonardo , author Robert Payne points to preliminary studies by the artist that bear a striking resemblances to Isabella around age 20. Payne suggests Leonardo captured Isabella across different life stages , including during widowhood, as depicted in the Mona Lisa. US artist Lillian F. Schwartz’s 1988 study used x-rays to reveal an initial sketch of a woman hidden beneath Leonardo’s painting. This sketch was then painted over with Leonardo’s own likeness. Schwartz believes the woman in the sketch is Isabella, because of its similarity with a cartoon Leonardo made of the princess. She proposes the work was made by integrating specific features of the initial model with Leonardo’s own features. This hypothesis is further supported by art historians Jerzy Kulski and Maike Vogt-Luerssen . According to Vogt-Luerssen’s detailed analysis of the Mona Lisa, the symbols of the Sforza house and the depiction of mourning garb both align with Isabella’s known life circumstances. They suggest the Mona Lisa isn’t a commissioned portrait, but a nuanced representation of a woman’s journey through triumph and tragedy. Similarly, Kulski highlights the portrait’s heraldic designs , which would be atypical for a silk merchant’s wife. He, too, suggests the painting shows Isabella mourning her late husband. The Mona Lisa’s enigmatic expression also captures Isabella’s self-described state post-1500 of being “ alone in misfortune ”. Contrary to representing a wealthy, recently married woman, the portrait exudes the aura of a virtuous widow. Late professor of art history Joanna Woods-Marsden suggested the Mona Lisa transcends traditional portraiture and embodies Leonardo’s ideal, rather than being a straightforward commission. This perspective frames the work as a deeply personal project for Leonardo, possibly signifying a special connection between him and Isabella. Leonardo’s reluctance to part with the work also indicates a deeper, personal investment in it. The theory that Isabella of Aragon could be the true Mona Lisa is a profound reevaluation of the painting’s context, opening up new avenues through which to appreciate the work. It elevates Isabella from a figure overshadowed by the men in her life, to a woman of courage and complexity who deserves recognition in her own right. Through her strategic marriage and political savvy, Isabella played a crucial role in the alliances and conflicts that defined the Italian Renaissance. By possibly choosing her as his subject, Leonardo immortalised her and also made a profound statement on the complexity and agency of women in a male-dominated society. The ongoing debate over Mona Lisa’s identity underscores this work’s significance as a cultural and historical artefact. It also invites us to reflect on the roles of women in the Renaissance and challenge common narratives that minimise them. In this light, it becomes a legacy of the women who shaped the Renaissance.",

        "content": "RORY McIlroy and Shane Lowry are amongst the favourites as the PGA Tour heads to Hamilton for the RBC Canadian Open this week. The PGA Tour will return to familiar territory for the pair from the island of Ireland after a five-year hiatus. Rory McIlroy is a two-time winner of the Canadian Open, winning two of the last three titles, with the last in 2022. There have only been three played since 2019 as the pandemic saw the cancellation of the 2020 and 2021 editions. And the Holywood hotshot took that title a year prior to back-to-back cancellations. He emerged victorious at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ancaster, Ontario with an impressive final round of 61, finishing at 22-under-par, seven strokes ahead of the runner-up. And that runner-up was none other than the world number three's pal, Shane Lowry . Both are coming off a recent win playing together at the PGA Tour's only team event, The 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans . The pair have engaged in a number of singles shootouts, Offaly star Lowry finished ahead of 35-year-old McIlroy at the 2022 PGA BMW Championship at Wentworth. 2019 Open Champ Lowry finished on -17, two shots ahead of McIlroy and Jon Rahm. And this week's stop in the Maple Leaf country could be an exciting one for Irish golf fans with both in solid form on the tour - especially considering the venue - when Rors won by seven-strokes from Lowry and Simpson, who placed second in 2019. Four-time major winner McIlroy recently won the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow, while Lowry is coming off a sixth place finish at the USPGA Championship . McIlory is 4th in the current FEDEX Cup standing, while Clara ace Lowry is 10th. Both are priced amongst the top-5 favourites with the Northern Irishman a 10/3 favourite to win a third Canadian Open as Lowry sits at what could be a generous 20/1. Canadian Nick Taylor won last year at Oakdale after he holed out a 72-foot putt for eagle to win during a playoff against Tommy Fleetwood. In doing so, he became the first Canadian citizen to win their national open since 1954, and the first born in Canada to win it since 1914. But on it's return to Hamilton Golf and Country Club, which last hosted the Canadian Open in 2019, Ryder Cup pals McIlroy and Lowry will fancy their chances at the event in Ontario. All the action is live on Sky Sports from Thursday.",

        "description": "Cheaters have already become an issue in XDefiant, and players are getting tired of their favorite FPS being ruined by foul play.",
        "content": "XDefiant is taking the FPS world by storm and as the popularity of Ubisoft’s Arena Shooter increases, the challenge Ubisoft now faces is to cut cheaters out of the picture. Many people have begun to encounter issues and negative experiences while trying out Ubisoft’s FTP Arena Shooter. Some players have been seen or going a step further, using hacks to ruin games. Members of the game’s community have been turning to Ubisoft’s official channels to report these issues, mostly to XDefiant’s official X account, where their are public for all to see. Though, some have been expecting more from Ubisoft in terms of tackling these issues head-on. On May 27, one user took to to report a cheater in their game – and this is something I have also experienced in games on European servers but not yet screenshotted. They said: “How lame do you have to be to cheat in a game that came out 5 days ago?” Before this, other Reddit users also having flagrant cases of cheating during their matches: “Not even 3 days after launch and we already have cheaters in the game. I was in a match where this one guy on the enemy team got over 80 kills with a vector just lasering everyone across all ranges. Nothing but him on the kill feed.” Some have said that if this issue is not resolved promptly, “the game will .” And though this is only the opinion of a moderate group among XDefiant’s community, if a problem persists for too long, it could quickly escalate into an uncontrollable chain reaction. FPS players are no strangers to similar events, with the likes of Star Wars Battlefront, Battlefield, , Apex, , and many others suffering the same fate. Cheating is a serious issue and one of the top reasons why players stop playing a trending game. The internal seems to work just fine, though its anti-cheat engine, BattleEye, could definitely use some improvements to detect cases of cheating on the go. A clear example of a dynamic anti-cheat engine is , which spots cheaters during gameplay and immediately kicks or bans them depending on the gravity of their foul play. Due to its zero-tolerance policy, some users have filed complaints about unfair bans happening for in the past. While of open lines of communication with the players have proven to be a powerful tool to improve Early Access games, XDefiant is a totally different case. The game is already in its Preseason stage, and a full launch led to a considerable increase in popularity. If Ubisoft want to keep enjoying XDefiant’s success, they should probably follow the example of developers. Hear out the players and keep their anti-cheat system up to date to stop the snowball before it comes crashing down.",

Abha came into the encounter with their fate in their own hands after late win over Al Khaleej last Thursday, which took them out of the relegation zone. The former Al Ahly tactician made just one change from the win against Al Khaleej, Meshal Al Mutain came in at right-back for Fahad Jumayah. While the first half proved to be quiet affair in terms of chances for the visitors, Abha went ahead two minutes after the break courtesy of a strike from Ahmed Abdu Jaber. The visitors were unable to hold on to that lead for long as Al-Hazm restored parity in the 58th minute, with Muhammed Badamosi getting his name on the score-sheet. Al-Hazm completed the turnaround with ten minutes left on the clock when Mohammed Al-Thani fired past goalkeeper Anton Tataru?anu to seal the win, which was the fourth of the season. As a result, Mosimane's side have officially been relegated as Al Alkhdoud moved to 15th position after defeating fellow relegation rivals Al-Tai, who finish the campaign in 17th position, one place behind Abha. It remains to be seen where Mosimane's future will lie as he only signed a with the Saudi club back in January. You must be to read and post comments",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch that sees its turret spinning out of control while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 13:52 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:11 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 97 View comments Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. The Russian T-90 tank was seen spinning out of control due to a bug dubbed 'spinning turret syndrome' Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s (pictured) before it malfunctioned Another piece of footage captured the moment another T-90 began spinning out of control The machine crashed into a tree which stopped the rotating However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. The impressive T-90 has been hit with an embarrassing bug where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls The T-90 tank is a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world' Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO – Blake Snell will start Monday on the pitcher’s mound, and he may end the day as a father. The 31-year-old left-hander was reinstated from the paternity list on Sunday and will make his scheduled start as his girlfriend, Haeley Mar, is still awaiting the birth of the couple’s first child. Her due date was last Monday, and Snell flew back from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area after his Wednesday start against the Pirates . Snell, the reigning National League Cy Young award winner, has struggled in orange and black since signing a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. He failed to make it past the fifth inning in any of his first three starts in April, and then he went on the injured list with a left groin injury. After dominating the minor leagues during his rehab stint, Snell surrendered four earned runs in 3 1⁄3 innings during his May 22 return against the Pirates. Giants manager Bob Melvin saw reasons to be optimistic after the latest start. “Incremental progress across the board,” Melvin said. “He was pretty good there early on. They made him throw a lot of pitches and it got away once he came out of the game, but I thought his stuff was a lot better.” The longtime manager was cagey when asked about the plan for Tuesday, with a vague “TBD” listed as the San Francisco starter facing former Giants first-round pick Zack Wheeler on the MLB website, before Kyle Harrison is slated to start on Wednesday. Mason Black, who filled that spot in the rotation through much of the last month after making his major league debut May 6, was optioned to Triple-A on Friday to make room for reliever Drew Pomeranz. In Thursday’s win over the Pirates, Black allowed four runs (all earned) in 2 2/3 innings, the third time in his four starts that he gave up at least that many runs. “I think anything is on the table,” Melvin said. “Whether we want to piece it together, whether we go with a regular starter or we call someone from the minor league side.” Brett Wisely will make his third consecutive start at shortstop after getting seven hits in his last three games. The 25-year-old from Jacksonville is batting .438 in 16 at-bats, but perhaps most importantly, has not committed an error. Related Articles “Brett’s been great, and that’s why he’s out there,” Melvin said. “We always talk about how if you get here and you perform, we’re going to find a place for you to play.” He has replaced top prospect Marco Luciano, who is hitting .391 but also committed five errors in the first five games of the Giants’ road trip before being sat for the finale against the New York Mets. Luciano isn’t totally in the doghouse, but he’s firmly behind Wisely. “Marco will get in the game here in this series, probably against lefties, but right now Brett is swinging the bat well and that’s why he’s in there.”",

        "description": "Underwater rivers ferry large volumes of seaweed from shallow seas into the deep, where its carbon is stored naturally",
        "content": "Deep in the ocean lies the world’s largest active carbon reservoir, which plays a pivotal role in buffering our planet’s climate. Of the roughly 10 billion tonnes carbon dioxide we emit each year, about 3 billion tonnes are taken up and stored in the oceans – and largely by plants. When we consider natural carbon storage in the deep oceans, we generally focus on phytoplankton. Trillions of these microscopic plants live in the surface waters all across the oceans. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, transporting carbon to the depths . But there’s a missing piece of the puzzle. Our two new studies show coastal vegetation such as seaweed forests are more important to natural carbon storage than we thought. Around 56 million tonnes of carbon in the form of seaweed is carried into the deep ocean each year. For carbon to be stored for hundreds of years, it has to enter slow cycling pools of carbon in the deep ocean. But most seaweeds only grow in shallow coastal seas. How can they get there? For decades, deep sea explorers have reported surprising findings. Pieces of seaweed and other coastal plants appear where they shouldn’t be. Fragments of seaweed are often caught in deep-sea trawls , or recorded by submarines and underwater robots during surveys of the ocean floor . Seaweed DNA has been detected in deep sea water and sediments in all of the world’s oceans, as deep as 4 kilometres down and up to 5,000 km from the closest seaweed forest . But how can seaweeds travel that distance? Our team discovered part of the answer. Seaweed can be carried by large “ underwater rivers ”, which flow from coastal waters along the seafloor across the continental shelf and into the deep. These currents form when localised cooling causes cold dense coastal water to rapidly sink below warmer offshore surface waters. The dense water slides down the slope of the seafloor, following the topography like a river, and carrying with it large quantities of seaweed to deeper areas. In Western Australia, these flows of seaweed and coastal vegetation towards the deep ocean happen most during colder months, when conditions allow these underwater rivers to form. During these months, storms often hit coastal waters, ripping up seaweed and filling the water with seaweed fragments. These underwater rivers are a well-documented phenomenon in Australia. But are these ocean currents transporting seaweed and their carbon elsewhere? We worked with an international team of scientists to find out. To do so, we tracked seaweed from coastal waters to the deep ocean using advanced ocean models. Our findings were clear. Seaweed forests do, in fact, transfer substantial amounts of carbon to the deep ocean in many parts of the world . This phenomenon is particularly high in the kelp forests of Australia’s Great Southern Reef , which stretches 8,000 km from Kalbarri in Western Australia to Coolangatta in Queensland. The seaweed forests of the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia and Chile are also carbon transport hotspots. While phytoplankton still sink vast amounts of carbon, our discovery suggests the plants of the coastal ocean transfer more carbon than we thought. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass all contribute to these flows of carbon, but seaweed forests are really big contributor. These forests are made up of large brown algae such as kelp and rockweed species, which form extensive hidden forests . Seaweed forests – such as Tasmania’s disappearing giant kelp forests – are the largest and most productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. Globally, these forests cover an area twice the size of India, and fix as much carbon during their growth as the northern forests of Canada – nearly 1 billion tonnes a year. Of this carbon, our research suggests between 10 and 170 million tonnes makes it to the deep ocean every year. Many of us don’t give seaweed much thought. But underwater seaweed forests play a vital role. These forests give shelter and home to huge numbers of fish and other marine species. They improve water quality and boost biodiversity. And now we know they help store carbon for hundreds of years. Like many other ecosystems, underwater forests are at risk. Hotter seas from climate change, coastal development, pollution and overfishing have pushed seaweed forests to die off faster than most other coastal ecosystems. Their fate has worsened in recent decades. The ocean is getting hotter, faster, bringing with it longer lasting and more frequent marine heatwaves . In Tasmania, the heating ocean has brought new species to seaweed forests, which now have subtropical fish species and voracious sea urchins. These urchins are chewing through the state’s kelp forests. In Western Australia, a severe marine heatwave struck in 2011, wiping out kelp forests along 100 km of coastline . These forests have not recovered. When we lose seaweed forests, we lose their natural ability to transfer carbon to the deep ocean. But their loss also threatens the other species who rely on them, and the half a trillion dollars of value they provide to us . We should think of conserving seaweed forests in the same way we do forests on land. Scaling up restoration where forests have been lost is vital to ensure these unsung plants can keep supporting us – and help store carbon.",

        "content": "Business owners have lamented that the recent interest rate increase by the Central Bank of Nigeria would have negative effects on businesses in the country. Their reactions came on the heels of CBN’s third consecutive increase of the interest rates for loans since February when the Monetary Policy Committee of the apex bank resumed meeting this year. In all, the MPC has increased the interest rate by 750 basis points since February. The committee in February increased the interest rate by 400 basis points which was 22.75 per cent as against the initial 18.75 per cent. The committee had also increased the interest rate by 200 basis points which was 24.75 per cent in March before finally adding 150 basis points, which was 26.75 per cent in May. However, the economists and business owners said that the continued increase would affect several businesses and hinder business owners from accessing loans. Speaking in an interview with Sunday PRIMANEWS, the Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Stores, Adeola Olufunke, expressed concern over the prohibitive interest rates on loans, describing them as a significant barrier to business success. She said, “Right now, the loan is a no-go area because of the interest rate. How can one get a loan and pay 26 per cent and still be able to run the business successfully? It’s just too much,” she lamented. Also, the CEO of LogiTrak Africa, Stephen Fola-Badejo, explained that the interest rate had severely affected businesses, especially startups as the new rate had also increased the borrowing cost. He urged that the Federal Government to put measures in place to mitigate the negative consequences on businesses. He said, “The interest rate has severely affected businesses, especially startups, leading to increased borrowing costs. It leads to increased borrowing cost for consumers, reducing their disposable income and purchasing power, ultimately affecting businesses that rely on consumer spending.” A business owner at Agric in the Ikorodu area of Lagos, Mr Michael Bankole, also said the consistent increase in rate would ultimately lead to unemployment, saying, “Without loans, businesses will not improve, and if that becomes the case, business owners cannot employ. If we can’t employ, it will worsen the level of unemployment in the country.” Speaking on the economic implication of the CBN exchange rate, an economist and Professor of Economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Sheriffdeen Tella, said the interest rate increase would prevent many businesses from borrowing. He said, “The interest rates raised indicate what the banks should charge their customers. If the CBN is charging 26 per cent, how many businesses can generate up to that? They will not borrow money because it is too high. Many of them will close down. Also, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Muda Yusuf, expressed concern over the tightening monetary conditions, saying, “We have seen yet a further tightening of monetary conditions in the economy. My prayer was for the MPC to pause the rate hikes.” He emphasised that the previous rate hikes which have been aggressive are hurting output and real sector investments, adding that most economic operators with credit exposures to the banks have not recovered from the hikes. Similarly, a professor of Capital Market at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, explained that the hike in the interest rate would likely have an adverse consequence on the equities market given the relationship between interest rates and equities market returns. According to him, over-reliance on the MPR as a tool to tame the inflation rate appeared to have no meaningful impact due to the significant non-monetary factors driving the inflation in the country, including the high cost of energy, transport as well as insecurity.",

        "content": "Sergio Perez is seemingly hitting the same slump in form as he did after last year’s Miami GP. The Mexican started the 2024 season quite well with podium finishes right behind Max Verstappen. However, his qualifying struggles in Imola and Monaco and further lack of recovery in the races could ring the alarm bells at Red Bull. Yet, the Austrian team is reportedly offering him a contract extension for next year. According to Autosport , the reigning champions feel Perez is the best candidate available right now to partner Verstappen. While there are times when the #11 driver struggles to match the Dutchman’s pace, he has done an incredible job of backing his champion teammate up as a wingman. Regardless, Red Bull have been reluctant to secure Perez as their number two driver for 2025. After his form dropped off the cliff last season, the Milton Keynes outfit did not want to offer the 34-year-old another multi-year deal. Meanwhile, Perez has reportedly been adamant about wanting a minimum two-year deal. This mismatch of expectations has caused the delay in Red Bull’s decision on who will be Verstappen’s teammate for 2025. Now, the team’s advisor Helmut Marko stated that by the Spanish GP , they would give clarity on their driver choice for the vacant seat. However, Perez’s recent performances in Imola and Monaco may make the Austrian team wait further before finalizing their driver lineup. Now, the former Force India driver has been a great teammate for Verstappen. But, his struggles to be at the front of the field with Ferrari and McLaren closing the gap, could become a detriment for Red Bull . Why Sergio Perez needs to step up for his future and Red Bull’s sake Sergio Perez’s poor qualifying and DNF at the Monaco GP did not do any favor to his contract extension case. Meanwhile, as Ferrari and McLaren’s upgrades have enabled them to cut down the gap to Red Bull , they are inching closer to the championship leaders in the standings. For context, the Italian team is only 24 points behind the Bulls, closer than they have been since 2022. Thus, Perez cannot afford to slack off in qualifying like he did in Imola and Monaco. The Mexican driver could easily become a liability for the Milton Keynes outfit if Ferrari and McLaren keep competing like they have in the past three races. The same notion is quite valid for 2025 and beyond too and Red Bull would be aware of it. As a result, they would want to make the right choice for the long term rather than retaining Perez for the same reasons they did in 2022. Apart from Perez, Red Bull will have multiple drivers knocking on their door, if they decide to look for a replacement. As things stand, they are not willing to promote Yuki Tsunoda or Daniel Ricciardo from their sister team, RB. Meanwhile, Carlos Sainz has been hopeful of a top team seat, the Austrian team has reportedly turned his candidacy down.",

        "content": "has revealed which of his co-stars failed to give him a baby gift following the birth of his son. During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the London Palladium, the Geordie duo welcomed viewers back for the semi-finals of the talent competition. This marked the first show the doting dad has filmed since the arrival of his son Wilder on May 14. It didn’t take long before his supportive co-stars congratulated the 48-year-old on becoming a father for the first time on the show. Turning to head judge for some words of wisdom, the music mogul showered him with praise. He gushed: “By the way, can I just say congratulations to you, Ant? Truly, I really am happy for you.” It was at this point that the audience erupted into applause as they cheered his celebration on the show. Ant chuckled: “Thank you, I know you are. And thank you for you lovely gift.” He cheekily added: “Judges, I’m still waiting on yours” as the panel nervously shifted in their seats. Simon attempted to save the conversation by noting: “It was from all of us” as Ant added: “Okay, yeah but it was signed by you, not them” as his co-star Declan chuckled beside him. It comes after the new dad reportedly asked Dec, also 48, to be a godfather to his son. A source told OK!: \"Dec is obviously so excited for Ant and has already been giving him advice - mainly how to deal with sleepless nights. He can't wait to take on the role of godfather and he's promised to take his duties very seriously.\" The insider revealed that Ant, who was previously married to makeup artist Lisa Armstrong, had \"always\" intended to make Dec godfather to any biological children he might have. In a touching tribute to their friendship, Dec's son, Jack even has Anthony as a middle name. Dec, who referred to Ant as the \"best friend a man could have\" in his best man's speech at Ant's 2021 wedding to Anne-Marie, is a father of two with his wife Ali Astall. They have a four-year-old daughter named Isla and a son, Jack, who will be two in July. An insider revealed that Dec's children are delighted to have a new playmate in the McPartlin-Donnelly clan, and the parents are already planning joint summer holidays to their neighbouring holiday homes in Portugal. \"Wilder will practically be like a nephew to Dec, and he and Ant are excited for their boys to grow up together as there's less than two years between Wilder and Dec's son Jack - they want them to become as close as they are,\" the source added. \"Also, Dec's little girl Isla loves babies and is very pleased there is another baby around. They're planning lots of playdates and family holidays they're all hoping to spend most of the summer in Portugal as they always do and are all excited for Wilder's first holiday. Dec has also joked that Ant and Anne-Marie won't need to spend a fortune on clothes, as they can have all of Jack's hand-me-downs!\"",

Emergency services rushed to the scene and the Dublin Fire Brigade has been dealing with the incident since then. The M1 motorway was closed, with traffic delays building for hours. Dublin Fire Brigade said a foam tender and water tanker were despatched to the scene. A large amount of waste spread out onto the carriageway, with a teleporter and prime mover also sent out to the scene to aid with cleanup. Dublin Fire Brigade posted on X: \"The M1 is currently closed as we deal with a HGV fire on the motorway. \"We're making good progress but traffic delays are building.\" It later added: \"Firefighting operations are continuing. \"A foam tender and water tanker are now on scene. \"A large amount of waste is on the carriageway. \"We're using a teleporter and prime mover to help clear the scene.\" Another post read: \"Our Manitou teleporter has been used to good effect to remove the burning waste so it can be extinguished and cooled.\" Dramatic pictures posted on the account showed smoke billowing over the motorway, while several vehicles and firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze and move the waste and truck. TII Traffic said the vehicle fire was causing \"heavy traffic\". It added: \"Expect delays and drive carefully.\" Meanwhile, last week the DFB issued an urgent warning ahead of heat hitting Ireland in warmer months. They alerted the public of the fire hazard associated with reflections. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Dublin Fire Brigade warned that reflections from mirrors and glass onto flammable surfaces can cause fires. They warned: \"Just a gentle reminder to remove mirrors, glasses, and vases from window ledges or anywhere they might be exposed to direct sunlight. \"They can cause fires if the sun is reflected onto a flammable surface.\" Where you have a mirror or any other glass object, such as an ornament, that is curved, this allows the glass to act as a lens. When the sunlight hits it, it becomes concentrated and, if the rays are bounced onto something flammable - like curtains or soft furnishings - then a fire can start.",

        "description": "The lawsuit alleges that James is using the \"State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers.\"",
        "content": "was hit with another lawsuit this week by an anti-abortion group relating to abortion pill reversal protocol. Last week, the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates, Gianna's House, Inc., and Choose Life of Jamestown, Inc., filed a lawsuit against James, alleging that she is using \"the State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers and a network of affiliated centers from providing the information\" regarding Abortion Pill Reversal. An APR procedure involves a woman who has changed their mind about aborting a pregnancy after taking mifepristone, a drug that is used to end a pregnancy. APR involves taking progesterone to offset the effects of mifepristone. The lawsuit states that a woman identified as Maranda recently welcomed her daughter into the world after an APR. According to the lawsuit, Maranda was taking mifepristone but later changed her mind about her pregnancy and received information from \"New Hope Family Services' website about a method of using FDA-approved progesterone supplements, which physicians may lawfully prescribe under New York law, in an effort to save a developing child by counteracting the hormone-blocking effects of mifepristone.\" \"The Attorney General alleges that New Hope and the other pro-life pregnancy centers are spreading 'false and misleading' information about progesterone treatment. She seeks an injunction and other penalties to censor their attempts to provide this information,\" the lawsuit says. \"This action seeks to enjoin the Attorney General from targeting, chilling, and punishing Plaintiffs' speech about progesterone treatment, and to declare that her actions violate Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to speak freely, to practice their religion, and to due process under the law.\" reached out to James's office and the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates via email for comment. Earlier this month, James was by a coalition of anti-abortion groups that said she sought to block Christian pregnancy centers from promoting so-called abortion pill reversal protocol. The Abortion Pill Rescue Network says that studies of APR have shown it has a 64-68 percent success rate of allowing the pregnancy to continue, but the course of action has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( ). Jor-El Godsey, President of Heartbeat International, one of several anti-abortion groups named as plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement that \"New York State laws protect abortionists and abortion on demand up until birth. Now they are targeting those who assist a woman in exercising her right to continue her own pregnancy.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Messier 78 is a nursery of star formation enveloped in a shroud of interstellar dust located 1,300 light-years away from Earth. Using its infrared camera, Euclid exposed hidden regions of star formation for the first time and mapped complex filaments of gas and dust in unprecedented detail.

Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Euclid, an ESA mission with NASA ’s support, aims to map the sky and study dark matter and dark energy. Its new images and data reveal significant scientific findings, including free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, enhancing our understanding of the universe. The Euclid mission has released five new images that showcase the space telescope’s ability to explore two large-scale cosmic mysteries: dark matter and dark energy . Dark matter is an invisible substance five times more common in the universe than “regular” matter but with an unknown composition. “Dark energy” is the name given to the unknown source causing the universe to expand faster and faster. The Euclid mission is led by ESA (the European Space Agency) with contributions from NASA , Cosmic Mapping and Precision By 2030, Euclid will create a cosmic map that covers almost a third of the sky, using a field of view that is far wider than NASA’s Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, which are designed to study smaller areas in finer detail. Scientists will then chart the presence of dark matter with higher precision than ever before. They can also use this map to study how dark energy’s strength has changed over time. Galaxy cluster Abell 2764 (top right), imaged by ESA’s Euclid telescope, contains hundreds of galaxies. The area outside the cluster also contains distant galaxies that appear as they did when the universe was only 700 million years old. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License The five new images feature views of varying sizes — from a star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy to clusters of hundreds of galaxies — and were taken shortly after Euclid’s launch in July 2023 as part of its early release observations program. The mission released five images from that program last year as a preview of what Euclid would offer, before scientists had analyzed the data. New Images and Research Availability The new images, related science papers, and data are available on the Euclid website . A pre-recorded program by ESA about these findings is available on ESA TV and YouTube . Mission planners with NASA’s forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will use Euclid’s findings to inform Roman’s complementary dark energy work. Scientists will use Roman, with its better sensitivity and sharpness, to extend the kind of science Euclid enables by studying fainter and more distant galaxies. Euclid’s view of the Dorado group of galaxies shows signs of galaxies interacting and merging. The shells of hazy white and yellow material, as well as curving “tails” extending into space, are evidence of gravitational interaction between the galaxies.

Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Curved Space and Gravitational Lensing One way Euclid will help scientists study dark matter is by observing how this mysterious phenomenon warps the light from distant galaxies, as seen in one of the new images featuring a cluster of galaxies called Abell 2390. The mass of the galaxy cluster, which includes dark matter, creates curves in space. Light from more distant galaxies traveling over those curves appears to bend or arc, similar to how light looks when passing through the warped glass of an old window. Sometimes the warping is so powerful it can create rings, pronounced arcs, or multiple images of the same galaxy — a phenomenon called strong gravitational lensing . Scientists interested in exploring the effects of dark energy will primarily look for a subtler effect, called weak gravitational lensing, which requires detailed computer analysis to detect and reveals the presence of even smaller clumps of dark matter. By mapping that dark matter and tracing how these clumps evolve over time, scientists will investigate how the outward acceleration of dark energy has changed dark matter’s distribution. More than 50,000 galaxies are visible in this image of Abell 2390, a galaxy cluster 2.7 billion light-years away from Earth. Near the center of the image, some of the galaxies appear smudged and curved, an effect called strong gravitational lensing that can be used to detect dark matter. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Instruments and Observational Capabilities “Because dark energy is a relatively weak effect, we need larger surveys to give us more data and better statistical precision,” said Mike Seiffert, the NASA project scientist for Euclid at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “It’s not something where we can zoom in on one galaxy and study it in detail. We need to look at a much bigger area but still be able to detect these subtle effects. To make that happen, we needed a specialized space telescope like Euclid.” The telescope uses two instruments that detect different wavelengths of light: the visible-light imager (VIS) and the near-infrared spectrometer and photometer (NISP). Foreground galaxies emit more light in visible wavelengths (those the human eye can perceive), while background galaxies are typically brighter in infrared wavelengths. “Observing a galaxy cluster with both instruments allows us to see galaxies at a wider range of distances than what we could get using either visible or infrared alone,” said JPL ’s Jason Rhodes, principal investigator for NASA’s Euclid dark energy science team. “And Euclid can make these types of deep, wide, high-resolution images hundreds of times faster than other telescopes.” Euclid’s large field of view captures the entirety of galaxy NGC 6744 and shows astronomers key areas of star formation. Forming stars is the main way by which galaxies grow and evolve, so these investigations are central to understanding why galaxies look the way they do. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Discoveries Beyond Dark Energy While dark matter and dark energy are central to the Euclid. The mission has a variety of other astronomical applications. Euclid’s large-area sky map can, for instance, be used to discover faint objects and observe changes in cosmic objects, like a star changing in brightness. Euclid’s new science results include the detection of free-floating planets (planets that don’t orbit stars), which are difficult to find because of their faintness. In addition, the data reveals newly discovered brown dwarfs. Thought to form like stars but not quite large enough to begin fusion in their cores, these objects highlight the differences between stars and planets. “The data, images, and scientific papers coming out now mark the very beginning of Euclid’s scientific results, and they show a startlingly wide variety of science beyond the primary objective of the mission,” said Seiffert. “What we’re already seeing from Euclid’s wide view has produced results that study individual planets, features in our home Milky Way galaxy, and the structure of the universe at large scales. It’s both thrilling and a little overwhelming to keep up with all the developments.” Euclid Contributions and Support Three NASA-supported science teams contribute to the Euclid mission. In addition to designing and fabricating the sensor-chip electronics for Euclid’s Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument, JPL led the procurement and delivery of the NISP detectors as well. Those detectors, along with the sensor chip electronics, were tested at NASA’s Detector Characterization Lab at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Euclid NASA Science Center at IPAC (ENSCI), at Caltech in Pasadena, California, will archive the science data and support U.S.-based science investigations. JPL is a division of Caltech.",

        "description": "A former student has requested a formal inquiry into the actions of Pinky Green.",
        "content": "By Natalie Akoorie of RNZ Warning: may have disturbing content A Tauranga Boys’ College teacher who resigned citing ill health after he was accused of propositioning a student in 1988 was the subject of multiple complaints, with some dating as far back as the early 1960s. The former student whose complaint ended the teacher’s career now wants an independent inquiry to establish the school’s conduct in the scandal. But the school says a historical abuse cases specialist reviewed the 1988 investigation and described it as “exemplary”. The former board of trustees chairperson said they achieved the best outcome possible in the circumstances. Details of more complaints have come to light in a report by the retired police sergeant who investigated in 1988 and found at least six complaints spanning the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Original complainant Glenn Marshall said the report proved more could have been done to hold English teacher Pinky Green to account. Instead the teacher - who died more than two years ago - resigned with his pension and reputation intact. Marshall accused the prestigious all-boys school in early 2022 of sweeping Green’s conduct under the carpet. The board of trustees issued a public apology for Green’s advances on students during the three decades he taught at the college. After the apology the school was contacted by several other victims, one of whom came forward publicly earlier this year claiming he was sexually abused by Green. Marshall, now 53, said he believed the 1988 investigation by retired sergeant Russell Christie showed the school could have done more. “They didn’t go looking for those other victims to find out exactly what happened. Instead they exited Green as quietly as possible.” What the Christie report found Marshall was 17 and in the 7th form (Year 13) in February 1988 when he was lured by Green to the school library after hours. There - with the blinds drawn and the lights off - Green asked the boy if he would agree to be paid up to $20 per session to perform bondage on the teacher. After Marshall’s mother and another parent complained, the school hired Christie. He interviewed two former college principals who reported a series of complaints from the early 1960s, including that Green took a group of Year 9 students on a picnic after school, prompting complaints from parents. Former principal Garth Sim, who died in 2017, spoke “severely” to Green and banned him from taking students away from school unless accompanied by another staff member or parent. It did not stop Green taking a boy home one lunch time in about 1963 where he propositioned the student, and later admitted caning the boy six times. He was threatened with dismissal, but apologised instead. Former principal Norman Morris told of a 1978 student who wanted to leave school to get away from Green, by then in charge of the library. The boy’s father inferred something had occurred between the boy - a librarian - and Green to provoke the reaction, and said if his son continued at the college Green was not to have any contact with his son. Morris, who died in 2021, believed Green to be a sadist, the report said. Christie also spoke to a Year 13 student who transferred to Ōtūmoetai College in 1988 because of Green, but the statement has not been released. Another former student told Christie a friend complained to him in 1987 that if he wanted promotion in the Tauranga Boys’ College library he’d have to physically beat his teacher, Green. Christie, who died in 2004, listed the names of three other students, which are redacted. Two students he spoke to admitted Green had approached them individually to participate in “experiments”. “Although never stated by anyone I have spoken to, it is quite clear that there are sexual overtones of an unsavoury nature in these approaches by Mr Green to these students and there is an obvious degree of either sadism or masochism, or both, and I believe that urgent action should be taken to resolve Mr Green’s future at an early date,” Christie wrote. He said he had no doubt Green’s conduct was “extremely unprofessional” and in his opinion, in breach of the Education Act 1964. What Tauranga Boys’ College knew The Christie report was unearthed in June last year, but Marshall did not know about it until April. He was never told about the other complaints, or that Christie considered him so affected by the proposition that he appeared “to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown”. “Mr Green is persisting in his attempt to have Glenn Marshall attend or meet him at the library and Marshall has become extremely emotionally upset over this matter, and it is apparent that some immediate steps must be taken to resolve this complaint and remove the obvious pressure from the boys,” Christie wrote. Marshall called for an independent inquiry to discover the full extent of the school’s role in enabling Green’s conduct to continue, and why Green was not sacked in 1988. “The school had several previous serious red flags brought to its attention regarding Green’s conduct, with the 1988 Christie report revealing that the two previous principals were aware of serious misconduct by Green against students dating back to the 1960s,” Marshall said. “Had he been dismissed, all these other students that we now know of what went on, none of those students had to be put through this.” The 1988 board chairperson hits back Former board of trustees chairperson Bill Holland said the board achieved the best outcome it could. “They were different times then. Sacking a teacher was not easy in those days. It’s by no means a straight-forward matter ... He [Green] had the backing of the PPTA.” Green had a lawyer and Holland said the teacher never admitted liability. Holland, a former lawyer himself, said if the school had persisted with a disciplinary process the students involved would have been put through a cross-examination process, and their anonymity would have been lost. “There was by no means certainty as to the outcome.” He and former principal Graham Young met with the parents of four students, including Marshall’s, and Holland said it was agreed to deal with Green in a way that protected the boys. “I thought that what happened to the boys was terrible. I was 100 per cent behind them. The process to try and look after the boys was the best outcome possible managed in consultation with their parents.” What the school says Tauranga Boys’ College principal Andrew Turner disagreed that the Christie report showed the school did not properly handle the 1988 complaint. “The new board initiated an independent review of the 1988 Christie report by a specialist in historical abuse cases which described the 1988 investigation as ‘exemplary’.” Turner said the school believed the process was handled properly in 1988 and because they had already undertaken a review the board would not conduct a further investigation. Asked whether he was disappointed more wasn’t done earlier to protect students from Green, Turner said matters like this were disappointing. “We believe the school did all it could to ensure students were safe once the concern was raised at the time.” Turner, who became the school’s principal in July 2022, said the new board had used the situation to review its policies and processes to ensure students and staff were kept safe.

        "description": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske.",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” THE AGONY OF DEFEAT As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” ___ AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing Jenna Fryer, The Associated Press",

        "content": "A 30-year-old Captain America sign from the original Bosco's stands in the property purchased by store owner John Weddleton in 2014. Weddleton plans to move his business to the new location early next year. (Bill Roth / ADN) As Alaska’s financial outlook headed south in the mid-1980s, so did John Weddleton. Unable to find work as an economist during the recession, he moved from Fairbanks to Anchorage in 1987 to work at Randy Ramuglia’s tiny comics store located in a shoe repair shop until he could find something else in his field. Although the store — Bosco’s — has called multiple locations home along Spenard Road, Weddleton never left. In the succeeding 37 years, Bosco’s has evolved into a vital resource for customers and a hub for activity in the world of comics, cards, collectibles and games. The store, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this month, is an unequivocal Anchorage success story, notable for both its longevity and prosperity. With a store in Dimond Center and a vastly larger Spenard headquarters, Weddleton, who is now the sole owner, employs around 30 people. John Weddleton, owner of Bosco's Comics Cards & Games, photographed at his store in Spenard on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. (Bill Roth / ADN) But despite the tens of thousands of pieces of memorabilia and merchandise that line the walls and aisles at the Spenard store, Weddleton maintains Bosco’s is chiefly in the people business. “Our motto in the store is listen to our customers,” he said. “We get what they want, sell it and repeat. You’ve got to listen your customers and when they start asking for stuff, you better make note.” That approach has served the store well in the realm of games and collectibles, where trends can ignite at the snap of a finger but also burn out just as quickly. When Magic the Gathering and Pokemon started gained popularity, Bosco’s was listening. “Having staff that people can talk to comfortably about what they’re passionate about,” store manager Eric Helmick said. “Being a communal focal point for those people to talk about their different nerd fandoms. We’re here on the frontlines when those people ask about stuff.” With an immensity of individual items packed from wall to wall, the store can be overwhelming to navigate without a roadmap. What started as a comic store quickly adopted sports cards. And as the trends and preferences changed so did the store, adding board games, anime, table top games like Dungeons and Dragons, graphic novels, Manga and more.

(Bill Roth / ADN) But with so many options, there is still a connective tissue that ties together customers of different stripes. “The through line is the passion,” said Bosco’s employee Vonnalet Mykham. “ You might not understand anything about Magic, but you can relate to it in a way that someone can relate to loving comic books.” It was a love for comic books that brought Jordan Whitethorn and Glen Lopez to the store on Wednesday. Bosco’s is a place for them to explore, relate and debate. “There’s something that led everyone here if you’re a comics person, or a sports card person or board gamer or card gamer,” Whitethorn said. ”You get to talking to someone about the thing you like and maybe they give that a chance or you find a third thing you both like.” “It’s such a valuable place for any fandom to have to centralize and start an argument.” It’s a fandom that David Harper is deeply familiar with. Harper has a website SKTCHD as well as a podcast called “Off Panel” devoted to the world of comics. He worked at the store as a teenager and has been a customer for 35 of his 40 years. “It’s home for a lot of people who love very specialized things that they wouldn’t find otherwise,” Harper said. “You come in and you see a whole bunch of people who are excited about the same things as you are. ... It’s an essential part of Anchorage and Anchorage’s collective of nerds.” SOME STORIES ARE TOO BIG FOR JUST WORKS BOSCOS sign in front of Bosco's comic shop Spenard Road on Friday, June 13, 2014. (Bob Hallinen / ADN) Nerd culture has gained broader acceptance in recent years with the popularity of superhero movies and other franchises that have hit the mainstream. But that hasn’t always been the case. The original store had posters in the window, but when Bosco’s changed locations in 1987, Weddleton opted for clear windows and a brighter, more lively environment. But a customer appealed to Weddleton to put the posters back up, saying he didn’t want to be spotted shopping in the store. “This was ‘87, people were embarrassed to be comic readers and now, not at all,” he said. With acceptance has come increasing quality. “ Line of Sight ,” a current exhibition at the Anchorage Museum, features the art of Alaska comic illustrators David Brame, Dimi Macheras and Nathan Shafer. “It’s incredible to think back 40 years that this museum connected with the Smithsonian has this major display on our local comic creators,” Weddleton said. A big part of the store’s success, Weddleton said, is its willingness to engage with its customers. Sometimes that means playing along. “The Death of Superman” in 1992 was a landmark moment in the comics industry and piqued the interest of readers, collectors and even the general public. The store organized a memorial for Superman at Dimond Center with Weddleton performing a eulogy of sorts for the fallen superhero. The event was complete with plants in the audience, who gave impassioned testimonials to his great deeds. “He saved my baby,” Weddleton emoted, repeating a line from an actor in the crowd. The store has also joined outraged customers in protesting the cancellation of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” which had a very popular accompanying comic. They’ve even petitioned the municipality to change the name of Anchorage road Lois Drive to Lois Lane, after Superman’s love interest. “It’s really important,” Weddleton said. “For one, it makes it more fun to do this crazy stuff. I mean, how many businesses can you do something like that?” The store has also engrained itself into Anchorage’s collective consciousness with well-known ads, touting the claim that “not just comics, Bosco’s has it all.” Many of the Bosco’s employees have been with the store for decades, developing connections and institutional knowledge. Helmick started working at the store in 1992 when he was still in college and Mykham has been there since before Bosco’s moved into its current location in 1995. John Weddleton, owner of Bosco's Comics Cards & Games, photographed at his store in Spenard on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. (Bill Roth / ADN) “I’m seeing people that I used to sell comics 20 years ago, they’re coming in with kids,” Helmick said. Weddleton credits his staff for much of the evolution of the store done over the years. “We reinvent ourselves constantly,” Weddleton said. “If they have an idea to do something my answer is, ‘Let me know how it goes. Let me know what you need from me.’ They’re smart. If you don’t try things, then you don’t innovate. You get stale.” Part of that innovation an expanded events room that allows the store to host swap meets and game competitions. “It’s fun for us to host events,” Weddleton said. “Our staff and I are gamers and collectors and so these are our people. And for a lot of our customers it’s a big part of their life to come here, meet with their friends and play this game. To offer that to people is really amazing. It’s so cool.”",

NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,” Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers’ series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. “It’s getting better day by day. It’s definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn’t run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. “Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn’t play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He’s not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,” Ohtani said. ”So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.” He hasn’t concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn’t pitching. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “It’s hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,” he said. ”I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "With the inaugural anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration coming up in a few days, IMOLEAYO OYEDEYI examines how far it has gone in fulfilling 25 per cent of its Renewed Hope Agenda to the Nigerian people In a few days, President Bola Tinubu will be celebrating his first anniversary as the 16th President of Nigeria. For many political observers, the inaugural anniversary aptly presents an opportunity to assess how far the much promising Tinubu’s government has gone in inspiring hope for millions of Nigerians since May 2023 when it came into power amid sheer hopelessness that almost sank the country under his predecessor. Worried by the prevailing despondency and misery that plagued the country under the Muhammadu Buhari regime, President Bola Tinubu, upon his assumption of office, vowed to rescue the supposed Africa’s giant from the claws of economic retrogression, deep-seated hardship, and worsening insecurity. Premising its roadmap on key national issues such as security, economy, agriculture, power, oil and gas, transportation, and education, Tinubu’s campaign train, in the build-up to the 2023 election, issued an 80-page policy document, which highlighted an eight-point blueprint for its Renewed Hope Agenda. Tinubu and wife, Oluremi waving In the manifesto published in October 2022, President Tinubu said his objective would foster a new society based on shared prosperity, tolerance, compassion, and the unwavering commitment to treating each citizen with equal respect and due regard. Among his glowing pledges contained in the campaign document, the President, if given the mandate, promised to “build a Nigeria, especially for our youth, where sufficient jobs with decent wages create a better life.” He also said his government would “manufacture, create, and invent more of the goods and services we require. Nigeria shall be known as a nation of creators, not just of consumers.” Under his watch, President Tinubu said Nigeria would “export more and import less, strengthening both the naira and our way of life.” He also promised to continue assisting the country’s ever-toiling farmers through enlightened agricultural policy that would promote productivity and assure decent incomes, so that farmers could support their families and feed the nation. The President said his government would “modernise and expand public infrastructure so that the rest of the economy can grow at an optimal rate, embolden and support our young people and women by harnessing emerging sectors such as the digital economy, entertainment and culture, tourism and others to build the Nigeria of tomorrow, today.” Tinubu waving His campaign promises also include “training and giving economic opportunity to the poorest and most vulnerable among us. We seek a Nigeria where no parent is compelled to send a child to bed hungry, worried whether tomorrow shall bring food.” More importantly on the economic front, Tinubu said his administration would “generate, transmit and distribute sufficient, affordable electricity to give our people the requisite power to enlighten their lives, their homes, and their very dreams.” He also promised to “make basic healthcare, education, and housing accessible and affordable for all and most importantly, establish a bold and assertive policy that will create a strong yet adaptive national security architecture and action to obliterate terror, kidnapping, banditry, and all other forms of violent extremism from the face of our nation.” During his inauguration which came in May, a few months after his victory in the 2023 presidential election, Tinubu also harped on his messianic policy to replace the despair on the faces of many Nigerians with joy and revive their fading hope in the ever-failing governance of the country. While delivering his inaugural speech with striking gallantry at the Eagles Square, Abuja on that sunny Monday afternoon, the President said, “Our administration shall govern on your behalf but never rule over you. We shall consult and dialogue but never dictate. We shall reach out to all but never put down a single person for holding views contrary to our own. We are here to further mend and heal this nation, not tear and injure it.” Given the numerous promises to Nigerians, observers have said it is expedient to examine how far the Tinubu’s administration has gone in delivering the expected 25 per cent of its Renewed Hope Agenda having been in the saddle for nearly 12 months. In their assessments, some of the analysts said the current government has so far fulfilled his ‘hit-the-ground-running’ pledge by implementing tough economic policies and rejigging Nigeria’s security apparatus, which they said, has tamed the rampaging monster of insecurity in the country even though there are still flashes of banditry as 40 people were massacred in Plateau State recently. Others opined that the timing and manner in which the government has initiated and implemented some of its policies had not been very strategic and mass-appealing, culminating in more hardship for Nigerians and severe battery for the economy. Reacting to the criticisms, Vice President Kashim Shettima, however, defended the bold reforms of the Tinubu’s administration, saying the government came in at a critical period when there was a strong need to take some unpalatable and drastic measures in other to rescue the country’s dwindling economic situation from total collapse. Speaking at the first edition of the Asiwaju Scorecard Series organised by the All Progressives Congress Professionals Forum in Abuja on Tuesday, Shettima said the ongoing reforms were becoming seemingly problematic for Nigerians because the Tinubu’s administration was not seeking shortcuts in its determination to revive the country’s ailing economy. He said, “In our quest for economic recovery, we must recognise that we are not here to cut corners. The path we have chosen is necessary. Indeed, His Excellency, President Boal Tinubu, has made the difficult but necessary choices to ensure Nigeria’s long-term stability and prosperity are never in doubt. He has chosen a path that, although demanding, promises to save our nation from economic downfall.” Recall that Tinubu’s administration began its flurry of policies with the pronounced removal of fuel subsidies. Though its predecessor did not make provision for a six-month subsidy payment in the 2023 national budget, many people had argued that President Tinubu ought to have made wide consultations across the board and devised workable strategies to cushion the harsh economic effects of the fuel subsidy removal before pronouncing it during his inaugural speech. The present government also floated the Nigerian currency twice which resulted in severe disruption in the country’s forex market, raising a nationwide outcry. However, the government has since stuck to its guns and resisted all pressures mounted by the CSOs and labour unions to force a reversal of the decision. Even though the CBN in tandem with other agencies of the government like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was able to launch and implement aggressive policies that appreciated the value of the naira in the interim, the country has not been able to fully get over the economic turmoil caused by the fuel subsidy removal and the deregulation of the FX market. Sharing his viewpoint on the 25 per cent scorecard of the current administration, especially in economic development, the Lead Investment Advisor at AfriVest (West Africa) Limited, a Nigerian capital market holding company with specialised subsidiaries focusing on the unique but integrated wealth management needs of clients in West Africa, Omosuyi Temitope, told Saturday PRIMANEWS that though the current administration lagged on major economic indicators that mattered to the average Nigerian, there were still hopes that its policies and reforms would deliver the needed impacts in the long term. “I will look at the performance from two viewpoints for a balanced assessment. On the policy/reforms front, this administration has taken several bold and almost unprecedented steps across both fiscal and monetary policy to address Nigeria’s economic quagmire. We have seen courageous moves on subsidy removal, unification of the foreign exchange market, student loans, national credit schemes, fiscal prudence, and the electricity sector, just to mention a few, although many have not achieved their intended impact due to many setbacks in implementation. “However, policy and reforms are means to an end. The end is to improve Nigerian welfare. This takes me to the second performance index: macroeconomic indicators. This administration has lagged on major economic indicators that matter to the average Nigerian. The inflation rate has reached its highest levels in decades. The exchange rate hit its highest level in history. Economic growth at barely 3% for a developing country like ours is less inclusive. Oil production has not improved massively. Our foreign reserves are still heavily encumbered, not to mention Nigeria’s rising fiscal vulnerability from mounting debt stock and its impact on government liquidity,” the AfriVest analyst explained. He added, “There are a myriad of disturbing challenges that now keep the country on the verge of a social crisis, especially from food and energy insecurity. While the reform measures taken look laudable and have a potent positive sentiment for foreign investors, the actual performance of the economy is critical to the nation’s stability going forward. “For this administration, it is not time to count gains yet if more Nigerians do not have access to or cannot afford adequate food and energy compared to previous years, irrespective of the cause. In short, people’s welfare is the most important scorecard, and that has fared poorly in the last year.” Also speaking with Saturday PRIMANEWS on the President’s first-year scorecard, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises, Dr Muda Yusuf, said, “One of the major commitments and achievements of the present administration was to correct some of the fundamental distortions in the economy, especially distortions in the micro-economic environment, those around fuel pricing and the subsidy issue as well as the unbelievable level of criminality that has pervaded the oil producing areas over the years and some other issues. “One of the major tasks was to rescue the economy from the brink because it was already at the brink as of the time the administration took over. Although the consequences of the macroeconomic weaknesses did not manifest under the previous administration, if we had continued on that trajectory, the consequences could have been more devastating than the cost of current reforms. So, the steps that have been taken to correct the distortions in the foreign exchange market and the petroleum downstream sector are major foundational steps. “This is because you cannot build something on nothing. You need to correct those distortions before you can begin to do some other more visible things. Unfortunately, the reforms have come with a lot of pains that have triggered inflationary pressures, which have affected businesses in many ways. But I believe that these are difficult choices that need to be made. If you don’t have a strong foundation, you cannot have a stable superstructure. So, I think we should acknowledge those steps and efforts that have been made to correct or to manage the outcomes of those corrective reforms.” Yusuf further said, “From the revenue perspective, we have seen a remarkable increase, both to the Federal Government and state governments as well as the local governments. We now have revenue in the federation account at a level that has not been seen in many years. I think this is something we need to acknowledge. Whether these revenues have been spent properly is a different matter. “However, from a fiscal consolidation point of view, some significant levels of improvements have been made. Some of the losses and corruption problems that characterised the Foreign Exchange market have been reduced. Though we are still contending with volatility in the FX market, because the exchange rate has depreciated significantly, it is still a work in progress.” He noted, “We have also seen some other measures such as the electricity sector reform. The decentralisation of the power sector is something we need to also acknowledge because it implies opening up the space for private investors and both the state governments and local governments. In the long run, I expect this to attract a lot of capital in terms of investment, both domestic and foreign, into the power sector.” Going forward, the economist said there was still a lot of work to be done by the current administration to moderate the level of inflation because the impact of the high inflationary pressure on peoples’ welfare had been enormous. He said, “We need to see some measures taken to bring down the cost of living. We also need to see a lot more in the area of reviewing the strategy for tackling insecurity, because this is also a very big problem. Of course, we have seen some progress with regards to road infrastructure, structural issues affecting productivity in the economy, and some investments.” Commenting on the inaugural anniversary of the Renewed Hope government, a Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Engagement, Fredrick Nwabufo, in a recent statement, said there were still some notable wins recorded by the administration in nearly one year. He said, “The intangibles of leadership are as potent and profound as the corporeal manifestations of governance. People must not only see the brick-and-mortar elements of leadership; they must also feel and sense leadership in its quantum of compassion, healing, solace, and capacity to inspire unity, as well as foster peace and progress. “The ongoing epochal Lagos-Calabar Coastal Road, with its attendant immense economic and social benefits to many states within and outside that corridor; the Sokoto-Badagry Road project, and the completed Port Harcourt to Aba stretch of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri narrow-gauge rail, among other key developments across the nation, assert the all-encompassing and genuine intentionality of President Tinubu’s administration to nation building. “Within the first year, the President also approved the upgrade of key health infrastructure and equipment across all six geo-political zones, in line with his administration’s vision of overhauling the health and social welfare sector for enhanced service delivery to all Nigerians.” He added, “The take-off of the first phase of the Consumer Credit Scheme, which is essentially a mitochondrion enabling citizens to improve their quality of life by accessing goods and services upfront, paying responsibly over time, and by the same token bolstering local industry and stimulating job creation, is another social cohesion sealant – with all classes of working Nigerians as beneficiaries.” However, the second year of the ‘Emilokan’ government begins on June 1 and only time will tell how far it will go in turning the country’s waning fortunes around.",

        "description": "\"This situation needs to be treated like the emergency it is.\"",
        "content": "The MLA representing the Cumberland House community says Saskatchewan’s premier should experience for himself a ride on Highway 123. After rains and spring conditions washed out the highway and made it largely impassable, Cumberland House officials last week declared a state of emergency for the village as well as the nearby Cree Nation. The highway serves as the lone road into the northern Saskatchewan community. Cumberland MLA Doyle Vermette on Monday criticized the provincial government for its lack of any tangible service towards fixing the problem. Vermette challenged Premier Scott Moe to drive Highway 123 himself, to experience just once what area residents are having to deal with in their day-to-day lives. “I have an invitation for the premier: Let’s meet where the pavement ends and I’ll let you drive and see it for yourself,” Vermette said. “I don’t think this government realizes how bad our road is.” Janelle Thomas, who started a petition on Change.org calling for improved highway infrastructure, said those using the road face “nearly impossible travel conditions.” “Transport vehicles carrying gasoline, food, and other necessities are getting stuck because of freight weight,” Thomas wrote. “Ambulances cannot make it through the muddy roads, putting our sick and elderly residents at risk of further illness or even death.” Moe last week said the Cumberland House community will be a “priority for conversations” with the provincial highways department. “We’ll work with the community on any immediate challenges that they have and also work with the community on what the investment looks like for that road in the future, and I would say it needs to be more, not less,” Moe said. Cumberland House is located approximately 450 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. The village and the First Nation each have a population of between 700 and 800 people. Opposition NDP Leader Carla Beck on Monday said people in Saskatchewan shouldn’t have to struggle to have access to medicine, food and fuel. “Cumberland House is in a state of emergency and the local leaders I’ve heard from rightly feel the government is not doing everything in its power to help,” Beck said. Cumberland House Mayor Ferlin McKay last week said the “deplorable and deteriorating conditions” of the highway “puts the health and well-being of our community members in jeopardy.” Cumberland Cree Nation Chief Rene Chaboyer said government action is urgently needed to address “the dire situation” on Highway 123. “We need a safe and reliable access for emergency services, food supplies, and vital resources,” Chaboyer added. Beck said a short-term fix should include the government deploying road builders and other resources — including airlifts, if needed — to ensure safe and reliable traffic, goods and supplies for the community. Beyond that, a long-term fix is necessary, she added. According to the NDP on Monday, highways critic Trent Wotherspoon and Vermette wrote a letter to Highways Minister Lori Carr on May 6, urging the government to take appropriate action and Carr responded on May 23 that government officials were “optimistic” that “conditions will improve significantly.” The next day, a state of emergency was declared. Said Wotherspoon on Monday: “This situation needs to be treated like the emergency it is.”",

        "content": "Strange 'tar balls' wash up on American beaches - and are linked to spate of deaths in animals By Nikki Main Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 21:08, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:16, 27 May 2024 e-mail 3 View comments A suspected oil spill has caused blobs of tar and oil-coated birds to wash up on US beaches . The pieces of tar are roughly the size of a sand dollar, measuring two to four inches in diameter, and are baffling officials as they rush to find the source. Hundreds of them have been found less than a week after local officials received reports of oiled birds found along a 150-mile stretch from Long Beach, Washington, to Lincoln City, Oregon . The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) confirmed on Sunday that the tar is 'petroleum-based,' indicating that the substance came from an unknown oil spill . The agency received 10 reports of oil-coated birds but recovered four - two were found dead and one later had to be euthanized. The pieces of tar (pictured) are roughly the size of a sand dollar, measuring two to four inches in diameter, are hard on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Local officials have warned that the public should not touch the tar and instead should report it to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife The US Coast Guard has searched for the source of the oil off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, but they have been unable to officially locate the source. Beachgoers first found the tar blobs at Cannon Beach last week which are typically formed when the wind and waves from the sea stretch and break apart oil from a larger spill into smaller pieces. The tar is hard and crusty on the outside but soft and gooey on the inside - much like a toasted marshmallow. But they can be hazardous for anyone who comes in contact with them. Both Washington and Oregon state agencies are conducting beach surveys and shoreline assessments as well as flights over the Pacific as they search for evidence of an oil spill or oil wildfire. Officials sent samples of the tar to a lab for analysis and some images show evidence of an oil sheen off the coast of Cannon Beach. There are no oil rigs or cargo located in the Oregon region - all sources of crude oil in the state is shipped from outside sources. 'The latest thing we've seen right now is a sheen that's about 1.5 miles in length near Haystack Rock,' Kevin Chan, emergency response coordinator for the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality told KGW8 News . About four common murres (pictured) were found coated in oil on the beaches in Washington and Oregon. Two of the birds had died when they were recovered and one had to be euthanized after responders analyzed its injuries Tar can mat and separate the bird's feathers, making it difficult to fly and removes the protective coating against water which helps the birds stay buoyant. Pictured: A common murre that was rescued and taken to a rehabilitation center in Oregon All of the birds found coated in oil were common murres which stay close to land when they aren't breeding but travel up to 20 miles offshore when they are. Breeding season hasn't yet started for the murres, two of which died shortly after they were rescued. Oil can cause the bird's feathers to mat, separate and lose their protection against water, making it difficult for them to fly or stay buoyant in water and it can make them severely ill if ingested. 'The main thing we're seeing (is) all of our birds are coming in emaciated,' Jolene Magee, who works as a rehabilitation technician for Wildlife Center of the North Coast told KGW8. 'They're preening so they're consuming the oil that's on their feathers,' she continued. Read More Major oil spill off Louisiana coast sees 1.1m gallons of toxic petroleum spewed into Gulf of Mexico - and experts fear it could wipe out endangered whales and turtles 'It's kind of a balancing act between getting them to feel better but acting quickly enough to where they're not consuming too much of the oil.' The US Coast Guard reported that four murres were recovered, including two that had already died and one had to be euthanized after evaluating its injuries. Local officials have warned the public not to approach the birds if they spot one but instead report them to 1-800-22-BIRDS (1-800-22-2477). 'Birds are often very stressed as a result of being oiled,' a WDFW spokesperson told KGW8 . 'This is part of the reason we ask the public not to attempt to capture oiled wildlife, as it may increase the stressors on the animal.' The ODFW asked the public to 'please leave cleanup to professional responders who are trained and equipped to handle this type of material,' but if they do touch the substance, it's important to wash yourself with soap or dish detergent and water immediately.

My name is Abby, and if there's one thing you should know about me, it's this: I LOVE BAGELS. They could be the greatest food of all time. What else is equally acceptable to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or as a snack? Nothing. Abby Zinman No, like, I don't think you get it... I was RAISED on bagels. My parents framed a painting of a bagel in their house. And although I've learned the hard way that not all cities have decent bagels (ahem, Calgary), bagels in Toronto (where I'm from) just don't compare to the \"Big Two\": Montreal and New York. Abby Zinman Yes, that's technically a Montreal bagel, and NO IT WON'T AFFECT MY SCORING. I've spent my whole life listening to friends and family from these two cities argue about whose bagels are better — but I've never actually sat down and compared them before. THE PEOPLE DESERVE AN ANSWER: Which are better, Montreal or New York bagels, once and for all?! Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Fox / Via giphy.com Just wait until Homer finds out about the pizza-bagel. Welllllll, I went to both Montreal and New York recently, with the sole mission of tasting bagels. And I'm excited to announce that we have a winner. Abby Zinman But first, the breakdown. In Montreal, I tried Fairmount , St. Viateur , and Dizz’s . In New York, I had Best Bagel & Coffee , Tompkins Square Bagels , and Brooklyn Bagel . It was extremely difficult to choose, but I vetted all of these spots on Google Reviews and TikTok — believe me, they're the best of the best. Abby Zinman The style and taste of each city's bagels is 1000% different. Montreal bagels are a hint sweeter, and the hole in the middle is bigger. They're also smaller and crunchier. Montreal is arguably more famous for their classic bagel and cream cheese — along with smoked meat sandwiches, of course. Abby Zinman Don't worry, I did try the smoked meat too, and it was LEGEN... wait for it... DARY. Meanwhile, New York bagels are bigger and doughier. They're more maximalist, crafting these huge sandwiches, and they have about a gajillion cream cheese flavours. Abby Zinman I don't know how I feel about birthday cake cream cheese, but I cannot lie, the cucumber dill cream cheese was incredible. Like, I couldn't finish my New York bagel sandwich in one sitting, and meanwhile, I gobbled my Montreal bagels down in just a few bites. Abby Zinman That cheese pull?? Are you KIDDING??? Sooooo, with all of that considered, I have my winner — which sort of depends on bagel flavour and occasion. I judged each city by category: best cinnamon raisin bagel, best everything bagel, best bagel on its own, and finally, best sandwich. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF ABC Network / Via giphy.com The two best kinds of bagels in general are without a doubt everything and cinnamon raisin, so let's discuss those first. The first category: CINNAMON RAISIN BAGELS. I judged these based on level of sweetness, raisin generosity, and overall cinnamon flavour. Because there's nothing worse than a cinnamon raisin bagel that doesn't taste like cinnamon. BLASPHEMY. And the winner is... Abby Zinman Yes, I'm making this very unnecessarily dramatic, and no, I'm not sorry about it. ...Montreal! The sweetness of the bagel complemented the flavour much better, and they were much more generous with the raisins. I had SO MANY of these bagels on their own as a snack throughout the day — they were SO. GOOD. Abby Zinman Those seeds on the bagel are only there because I'm not smart and decided not to separate the bags of bagels. Anyway. And now, for EVERYTHING BAGELS. I'm judging on the true quality of an everything bagel: how much flavour can you truly pack in a bagel? And, you know, how much do I want to keep eating it despite the garlic breath? My pick is... Abby Zinman Yes, that's a challah in the back of the Montreal photo. IYKYK. ...New York! I found that the doughiness of the bagel and more extravagant flavours worked better for their everything bagel, rather than Montreal's. Although both were pretty great, I'd definitely rather get an everything bagel in New York than Montreal. Abby Zinman Next: best bagel on its own! Like, no butter, no cream cheese, NOTHING. Essentially, which is the best to take a bite out of as you're leaving the bagel shop, because you can't quite make it home before you start eating? My winner is... Littleny / Getty Images, Abby Zinman Yes, I had to use a stock photo for New York because... well... I ate it too quickly. ...Montreal has New York beat here! The more dense texture and slightly sweeter flavour just works better when it's plain. They feel more... I don't know... authentic. Like, you know when Harry Styles said \"this movie feels like a movie \" about Don't Worry Darling ? Well, Montreal bagels feel like a bagel . So there's that. Abby Zinman And finally: I happen to be a \"go-big-or-go-home\" girlie, so that means that arguably the most important category is SANDWICHES. AKA, which bagel goes best with something on it? Because, TBH, that's how I want to be eating my bagels most of the time. Drumroll please....... Abby Zinman ...New York bagels just appeal more to me. DON'T HATE ME, CANADA! There's just nothing on the planet I'd rather eat for lunch than this New York bagel sandwich (yes, even smoked meat). Montreal bagels just don't work as well for sandwiches, not just because of their size, but also their texture. So my overall winner is New York, since this was the greatest bagel I've ever had in my life. Abby Zinman LOOK AT HER AND TELL ME I'M WRONG. She's beauty and she's grace. Check out that soft-yet-a-bit-crunchy bread, and how it envelops the whole sandwich. I'm in love. Abby Zinman But before Canadians start yelling at me in the comments (and before my Montreal family shuns me forever): this doesn't mean I don't LOOOOVE Montreal bagels, too... it just means I'd rather have a New York bagel sandwich than literally any other kind of bagel ever. PERIOD. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Bravo TV / Via giphy.com And there we have it: your official review from the biggest bagel fan you'll ever find. I gotta go have a bagel for lunch, but in the meantime, tell me what your pick for best bagel ever is in the comments, yeah? 🥯 Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Netflix / Via giphy.com Also, make sure you follow BuzzFeed Canada on Instagram and TikTok — even if you're not fans of Montreal bagels — because us foodies gotta stay together.

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden salvages his season with an Indy 500 win on a last-lap defeat of a heartbroken O'Ward INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. One way to ensure a new contract is in your future is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O’Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. O'Ward, meanwhile, was devastated by his near-miss. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Trevino wins grant from MLB Players Trust for charity that teaches art to those with special needs HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “Special Hearts in the Arts” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet.",

        "description": "The 57-year-old former heavyweight champion has been preparing to fight YouTuber Jake Paul.",
        "content": "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson had a medical emergency Sunday on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, his representatives said Monday. Tyson “became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing,” his representative said in a statement to The Times. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Tyson is now “doing great,” according to the representative. Tyson, 57, has been preparing to fight 27-year-old YouTube influencer Jake Paul on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. Tyson reigned as a world champion from 1987 to 1990, but retired from professional boxing in 2005 — when Paul was a child. The fight will be televised live on Netflix; the streaming giant has expanded its push into live entertainment in recent months with “The Roast of Tom Brady” and the multipart “John Mulaney Presents: Everybody’s in L.A.” They also signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment to move the WWE’s flagship weekly wrestling series “Monday Night Raw” to the streamer starting next year. Tyson — who was once boxing’s youngest-ever heavyweight world champion — will be 58 when he faces off against Paul at AT&T Stadium this summer. The boxer’s long saga in and out of the sport has included heavyweight titles, prison time, a memoir , a well-known cameo in “The Hangover” and, perhaps most infamously, biting off a small chunk of fellow boxer Evander Holyfield’s ear during a 1997 fight. On Monday morning, Paul appeared to respond to Tyson’s medical incident and subsequent questions about the upcoming fight on the social platform X , writing that people make things up “before knowing the facts for clicks / likes. Nothing changed #PaulTyson.” Tyson, who is considered one of boxing’s all-time greats, has praised the brash Youtuber and former Disney Channel star in the past, saying last year that Paul’s embrace of the sport was helping put bodies in seats. Like Tyson, the influencer-turned-fighter has also courted controversy in the past: He threw a massive house party during the summer 2020 height of the COVID-19 pandemic that sparked ire from Calabasas’ mayor , among other issues .",

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "description": "As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. One way to ensure a new contract is in your future is by winning...",
        "content": "He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen.

Martial, in a lengthy statement on Instagram on Monday, said it was time for him to turn a new page in his career. The Frenchman is leaving Man United as a free agent as his contract expires this summer following the conclusion of the 2023/24 season. “Dear Manchester United fans, It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye,” Martial’s statement partly read. “After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career.” Martial struggled for game time under manager Erik ten Hag this term. He featured in just 19 matches across all competitions this season, with scoring two goals and providing one assist.

        "description": "The attempt by Anthony Fauci and other officials to cover up funding gain-of-function research in China only compounded the horror, making it more difficult for honest researchers to understand COVID's origins.",
        "content": "Bad enough that Anthony Fauci and other top officials flouted the law by funding gain-of-function research at China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, where the COVID bug is believed to have originated. But their attempt to cover it all up only compounded the horror, making it more difficult for honest researchers to understand the virus’ origins. Now that it’s all in the open, those officials need to pay. At a House hearing last week , emails revealed that a key Fauci aide at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. David Morens, used a “secret back channel” to hide evidence that a grantee had funded the dangerous research. Morens bragged about deleting “smoking gun” messages related to COVID’s origins — in blatant defiance of record-keeping laws and in an attempt to obstruct a House probe — to protect Fauci and other colleagues. He also used a private email address to avoid Freedom of Information Act requests. In a Sept. 2021 message, Morens noted that he’d “always communicate on gmail because my NIH email is FOIA’d constantly” and he’d “delete anything I don’t want to see in the New York Times.” In a Feb. 2021 email, he wrote that he “learned from our foia [ sic ] lady here how to make emails disappear after I am foia’d.” Could evidence of a coverup be more blatant? Subscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter! Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. A 35-page memo by a House subcommittee majority staff directly accuses Fauci himself of taking part in “in a conspiracy amongst the highest levels” of the agency to “hide” and potentially “destroy official records regarding the origins of COVID-19.” What were Fauci & Co. trying to hide? Obviously, that NIH had provided grant money used for highly dangerous lab work, which involves making viruses more contagious to humans to help develop vaccines in advance. Meaning US taxpayers unwittingly helped pay for the kind of research believed to have led to the germ that killed more than 7 million people across the globe. It also shut down economies, costing the world trillions; led to school closures that set back educational progress; and took a toll on mental and physical health in fundamental ways not yet fully understood or recognized. Fauci, his NIH boss Francis Collins and their pals at EcoHealth, which was behind the research, were desperate to keep that secret. Indeed, the coverup began even before the full-blown pandemic erupted: In February 2020, Fauci and Collins “prompted” a scientific paper meant specifically to “disprove” suspicions that COVID came from that lab. Fauci then later cited the paper as evidence the lab-leak theory was wrong and pretended he had nothing to do with it. House Republicans are weighing whether to recommend criminal charges against Morens. Good. But every one of those top officials involved in the coverup and the funding needs to pay a steep price.",

        "content": "World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday expressed confidence that a deal on a global pandemic accord can still be reached, Primanews has reported. For more than two years, ministers from among the WHO’s 194 member states have been struggling to draft a treaty on new pandemic response rules in the wake of Covid-19, which the global health body estimates has killed 13 million people since 2019. Negotiators once again failed to produce a draft deal last Friday for formal approval by the World Health Assembly this week. Tedros told the assembly in his opening address. He said and that he that a deal can still happen. the director-general told the assembly. WHO member nations had asked the UN health agency in 2021 to oversee talks for a pandemic agreement and envoys have been working in recent weeks to formulate a draft document ahead of a self-imposed deadline this month. However, according to media reports, negotiators were divided on numerous issues. Primanews reported that health officials were frustrated with discussions stretching past midnight, with last-minute U-turns on positions and with growing criticism that such a treaty would undermine national sovereignty. According to the report, a truck with a sign reading was seen near the UN headquarters in Geneva, where the talks are being held. Earlier this month, Republican senators wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden denouncing the draft agreement, for and potentially and called on Biden not to sign off. The whole process could take up to another two years to complete, a senior US administration official told Primanews, adding that Washington was still committed to the process. Talks are reportedly still ongoing to update existing rules on disease outbreaks, with a new tiered system of alerts being discussed as a response to criticism that the WHO was slow to act on the Covid-19 pandemic in its early stages. Covid-19 initially emerged in late 2019 and developed into the largest epidemic in nearly a century. The WHO said in a new report last week that an estimated 13 million people died during the pandemic.",

        "description": "The Brainerd community gathered inside at the Brainerd Armory on Memorial Day Monday, May 27, to honor the servicemembers who gave their lives.",
        "content": "BRAINERD — A rainy Memorial Day kept the streets of northeast Brainerd clear of parade marchers this year, the vacant roadways an oddly befitting tribute to those honored on the holiday. The annual Evergreen Cemetery ceremony moved inside to the Brainerd Armory, rain clouds not keeping the community from remembering their fallen brothers and sisters on Monday, May 27. The Brainerd High School marching band kicked off the solemn celebration with a rendition of “America the Beautiful.” Following the Pledge of Allegiance and National Anthem, Auxiliary representatives placed memorial flowers, with Shirley Kuhn contributing a yellow flower, representing the Gold Star Mothers who lost children in service. Natalie Petersen, assistant veterans service officer at Crow Wing County, gave the keynote address, recalling those she served with during her two tours in Iraq as a mechanic and vehicle recovery specialist with the U.S. Army. “While many see this as a long weekend to enjoy with their families, attend barbecues and take a long vacation, there are so many people that have a reason to take this time and reflect on those that have served our great nation and made the ultimate sacrifice to our country and for our freedom,” Petersen said. “Husbands, fathers, sons; wives, mothers, daughters that left home to serve the country they loved and never made it home.” ADVERTISEMENT As a female veteran, Petersen said she wanted to pay special respects Monday to her sisters in arms, those women who lost their lives in service to their country, in some cases before they could even be recognized as service members. “They served as nurses, pilots, administrative specialists and even spies,” she said. “They left home at a time when society said they shouldn’t and couldn’t, to aid the war effort on the battlefield.” While researching the history of women in the service, Petersen said she came across 2nd Lt. Ellen Ainsworth, a nurse from Glenwood City, Wisconsin, who enlisted in the Army Nurses Corps in 1942 and served in World War II. She was deployed to Anzio, Italy, where she worked at the 56th Evacuation Hospital, considered a frontline support hospital. She cared for American and British troops up until her last days before dying in the Battle of Anzio. She’s remembered as the only Wisconsin woman killed by enemy fire during WWII. For her sacrifice, Ainsworth earned the Silver Star, Purple Heart and World War II Victory Medal. “Memorial Day serves to bring to the forefront of our minds, those that we’ve lost and the sacrifices they have made for our way of life,” Petersen said. “They should serve as role models on the values to which we should cherish our lives, families and loved ones, not taking for granted a single moment that has been sacrificed for us.” Petersen challenged those listening Monday to use Memorial Day as a time to look up the story of a lost servicemember.“And let that resonate with us throughout the year,” she said. “And do this every year so that they may be remembered in our history as those that gave all, and they will never be forgotten.” Local WWII Navy veteran Harry Meyer used the day to remember the Navajo Code Talkers with whom he served. Part of an operation kept secret for decades after the war, Navajo Code Talkers were American Indians who used their little-known native language to send secret communications on the battlefields. Meyer operated the radio for the code talkers, serving in the Pacific Theater. After Monday’s ceremony, Meyer spoke of the code talkers who were lost in battle, said the thoughts running through his mind that day were of the well-trained American Indians who sacrificed for their homeland and whether they’ve all gotten the proper recognition for the part they played. ADVERTISEMENT Chaplain Reverend Eusebia “Chappy” Rios gave the invocation and benediction to open and close the ceremony, asking for blessing upon the nation and the community and for unification, not division. Brainerd High School trumpeters wrapped the event up with taps, sending the crowd of attendees back out into the dreary Memorial Day weather with plenty to think about on the day of remembrance.

        "content": "MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as “vital” in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has “its own large reserves of uranium.” Putin, in turn, vowed to “do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.” If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China , where he expressed appreciation for China’s proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "content": "Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,\" Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers' series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. \"Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers , Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Sutter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. \"It’s getting better day by day. It's definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn't run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. \"Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn't play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,\" he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He's not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,\" Ohtani said. ”So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.\" He hasn't concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn't pitching. “It's hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,\" he said. ”I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.\" AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",

        "content": "Warm, summer-like temperatures can be expected later this week in Humboldt County, especially inland. With the weather warming up in a typical manner for the season, the National Weather Service office in Eureka and the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office have urged safety in the rivers. Johnathon White, a meteorologist at Eureka’s NWS office, said over the weekend a ridge brought warmer temperatures and coastal stratus on the coast, a pattern that continued Monday. Into Tuesday, he said there will be some clearing of the coastal stratus along the coast. “It’ll bring more cloudiness and cooler temperatures for inland areas,” he said. Another ridge is expected to come in the middle-end of the week to bring warmer temperatures inland and slightly warmer coastal temperatures. The temperatures are forecast at a high in the 90s for inland Humboldt County near the week’s end and in the 60s around coastal areas. Warm temperatures recorded over Memorial Day weekend is not unique. “It looks like this is a pretty typical weather week for this time of year,” he said. The windiest part of last weekend recorded at the NWS office on Woodley Island was Saturday afternoon and evening — and Sunday, when kinetic racers were crossing Humboldt Bay saw some strong wings as well. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will see tall seas, with NWS Eureka’s marine outlook expecting gale force winds Wednesday night, with seas building to 7-10 feet. Friday, the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office said both the Trinity and Klamath Rivers pose significant risks for swimmers at this time of year and advised the public to stay out. “As we honor those who have served in our military and enjoy the outdoors, we urge caution regarding swimming in our local rivers. It remains too early in the season to safely swim in several of our waterways, notably the Trinity River,” a news release from HCSO said. The risks are due to high water levels, cold temperatures, submerged obstacles, and swift currents. The Sheriff’s Office offered the following safety recommendations: “The Sheriff’s Office emphasizes the importance of exercising caution and using common sense when enjoying our counties rivers and the ocean. Your safety should always be the top priority,” the release said. Sage Alexander can be reached at 707-441-0504 Most Popular Trending Nationally",

        "content": "The potential seeding pots for the upcoming Champions League draw have been revealed, and it appears Arsenal could be in for a tough ride following the conclusion of most of Europe’s top leagues, reports express.co.uk. Arsenal are preparing for their second consecutive Champions League campaign after narrowly missing out on the Premier League title to reigning champions Manchester City. Next season will see significant changes to UEFA’s flagship event, with the number of competing teams increasing from 32 to 36. The traditional group stage is being replaced by a league stage, where each team will face two clubs from the four seeding pots. Seeding pots will now be determined by coefficients, moving away from the previous system which was based on the holders, Europa League winners and domestic champions. Germany has secured a fifth Champions League spot due to their superior coefficient rating, while Atalanta’s recent success has earned Italy an impressive six spots. Due to their six-year absence from the Champions League prior to this season, Arsenal are expected to compete in the second seeding block alongside Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid and Atalanta. This situation could lead to a challenging Champions League campaign for Arsenal, as the first pot seeds have been confirmed to include Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool, Inter, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Barcelona. The Gunners are below Liverpool despite finishing higher than them in the Premier League in both of the last two seasons.That is because of the Reds’ superior UEFA coefficient courtesy of their performances in Europe in recent years. Pot two has been confirmed to include Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, Juventus, Benfica, Arsenal, Club Brugge and AC Milan, with Shakhtar Donetsk expected to join them through qualifying. Seven more spots are up for grabs in the qualification stage. If things go as planned, Aston Villa will find themselves in pot four alongside Monaco, Stuttgart and Bologna, while pot three could see Celtic, Feyenoord, Sporting CP and PSV. The group-stage phase will now feature eight games instead of six. The top eight teams will advance to the last 16, while those ranked ninth to 24th will compete in a play-off to join them. Teams placed 25th to 36th, along with the losing eight sides, will be eliminated from the competition. Clubs from the same country cannot face each other, which means Arsenal, City, Liverpool and Aston Villa will not be pitted against each other. In a worst-case scenario, Arsenal may have to contend with Bayern Munich and Barcelona from Pot 1 and Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus from Pot 2. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "The Alberta Sheriffs have shut down a property in northwest Calgary after complaints of drug activity and dozens of police visits. Between Aug. 1, 2022 and May 21, 2024, the Calgary Police Service attended the property, 19 Berwick Crescent N.W., 45 times for various types of calls for service, officials said in a news release. The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods (SCAN) unit of the Alberta Sheriffs obtained a community safety court order against the owner of a Calgary property that gave investigators the authority to close the property for 63 days, starting at noon on Monday. Any tenancy or lease agreement is terminated, effective Monday. “The closure of yet another problem property will help put residents’ minds at ease while serving as a reminder that illegal activity will not be tolerated in Alberta communities. I commend them for their hard work to ensure the safety of Albertans and their communities,” said Mike Ellis, Alberta’s minister of public safety and emergency services. The property will be boarded up, fenced and have locks changed to prevent people from entering. SCAN unit members will monitor the property throughout the investigation. The SCAN unit operates under the Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act, which uses legal sanctions and court orders to hold owners accountable for illegal activity happening on their property. Alberta’s SCAN unit has investigated more than 9,000 properties and has been granted 119 community safety orders since it was created in 2008. Most complaints are resolved by working with owners to stop the illegal activity on their property, according to officials.",

        "content": "National Weather Service forecasters issued a severe thunderstorm watch for 21 New Jersey counties and the Lehigh Valley until 9 p.m., with the possibility of “damaging winds and large hail” as Memorial Day weekend comes to a stormy conclusion. The latest forecast reduces the potential of tornadoes predicted in an earlier forecast, but doesn’t eliminate that risk, said Sarah Johnson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mount Holly. “There is some risk of a tornado, but damaging winds and large hail risk are more of a concern,” she said. “It’s on the lower end compared to other hazards.” A severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania until 9 PM EDT pic.twitter.com/C9NSNtO1sf The forecast for the Lehigh Valley calls for the possibility of more rain. “The risk for heavy rain is slightly higher in the Lehigh Valley,” Johnson said. “We are worried the storm this evening may not move as fast as it is in the east and south.” While some parts of the state were in a lull after rain from earlier storms, Johnson said the storms are returning and people who are outside should monitor weather forecasts and be prepared to get indoors. “Our bigger concern is with another round comes after 4 p.m., and continues through the late evening hours,” she said. “There will be a lightening and a heavy rain threat, it won’t be safe to be outside.” The storms are expected to be offshore by midnight, she said. Bad weather forced Easton to cancel its Memorial Day parade. “It’s unfortunate timing, a lot of people had plans for outdoors activities and Memorial Day ceremonies had to be canceled,” Johnson said. “Unfortunately, the weather didn’t cooperate.” Our journalism needs your support.

        "content": "Young Sheldon has come to an end after seven seasons and now a new type of Big Bang Theory has emerged with a hot take about the spin-off. A to Reddit and shared that, despite their love for the original series, they just couldn’t get into . “Big Bang Theory is top 5 in my world. I cannot even count how many times I watch it,” the user wrote. “It’s my go-to most of the time. But...I cannot stand Young Sheldon. Am I alone?” It became very obvious that the preference wasn’t uncommon as another person commented, “Agreed, Big Bang Theory is one of three shows I continually watch reruns of, but didn’t watch more than a few episodes of YS.” Some fans confirmed that, while they did watch Young Sheldon, it’s not made to be rewatched as one fan explained, “I actually agree with this opinion!?? They’re super different shows! BBT is a multicam sitcom and YS is a single cam. It makes a huge difference in the comedy performing for an audience vs recording a scene over and over exactly the same so the producers can get the right angle. A third fan agreed with the rewatching point writing, “I watch both but I only rewatch TBBT somehow. And YS is definitely a different story than TBBT so your feeling is understandable.” One Reddit user pointed out one big way Young Sheldon differed from The Big Bang Theory with the comment, “I love TBBT and I liked Young Sheldon too, but they’re quite different. Young Sheldon feels a lot more serious(?) in a way and it just doesn’t feel like a sitcom to me (eg no background laughter).” Despite not winning over the favor of all Big Bang Theory fans, was successful in its own right with its series finale .

        "content": "THERE is no escaping supermarket shrinkflation – but this one really takes the biscuit. It was recently revealed that Ritz crackers have reduced in size by up to 30 per cent, while prices at the till remain the same. 7 Laura Stott tests supermarket own-brand cheese crackers Credit: Damien McFadden A report by The Grocer magazine found the famous original red carton had shrunk from 200g to packs weighing either 150g or 140g. Laura Stott compares the big-brand bakes to supermarkets’ own offerings for taste, price and quantity to work out which offers the best biscuits for your buck. Ritz Original Crackers 36 crackers, 150g, £1.25, Morrisons 7 Ritz have shrunk their packets and kept the same price Credit: Damien McFadden DESPITE the smaller quantity, the wheat bakes still deliver on flavour, with an instantly recognisable salty tang and melt-on-your-tongue texture. They are just as tasty on their own as topped with your favourite cheese. But the box is notably smaller than Lidl and Aldi’s own versions so you only get 36 crackers, and mine had lots of smashed ones too. You pay a big premium for the brand. RATING: 2/5 Most read in Money BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate Rivercote Savoury Crackers 57 crackers, 200g, 99p, Lidl 7 Lidl's version is packed like Ritz crackers and is a top buy Credit: Damien McFadden LIDL’S version also looks very similar on the shelf in a bright red carton. Battle Of The Tinned Cocktails Again, this one weighs in at 200g, so you get 50g more for your money, and at less than £1 for the box they offer top value. Really delicious savoury crackers that were a touch more golden brown than the originals, which really improved the flavours. They had a lovely crunch and were very moreish. A top budget buy. RATING: 5/5 Savour Bakes Savoury Crackers 57 crackers, 200g, £1.09, Aldi 7 Aldi crackers are great value Credit: Damien McFadden THESE look remarkably similar to the big-brand version on the shelf, except the box is much bigger as Aldi still gives you 200g for a far lower price. Inside, the tasty wheat bakes are not easy to differentiate from the pricier version either, although they are perhaps a touch drier and saltier. I’d happily snack on these as they come. A great cupboard standby that is very good value too. RATING: 4/5 Cheese Thins 41 crackers, 150g, £1.10, Tesco 7 Tesco crackers are perfect to have with cheese Credit: Damien McFadden A DELICIOUS crunchy biscuit that is slightly larger than the big brand but perfect for dunking or topping with your favourite cheese. The cheese powder is very noticeable sprinkled on top, so you get the waft of fromage and a hefty hit of the tangy taste but it isn’t too overwhelming or artificial tasting. They are still subtle enough to enjoy with real cheese. RATING: 3/5 Cheese Thins 40 crackers, 150g, 95p, Aldi, 7 Aldi's cheese thins are tasty and affordable Credit: Damien McFadden A BELTER of a bargain cracker pack and you get a good amount for your buck. The wheat biccies are very tasty, nice and chunky with a good amount of bite and quite a strong flavour. On the downside these crumbled quite easily. That said, they were still very tasty nibbled alone and I also enjoyed them with a bit of cheese on top. But these are good value. RATING: 4/5 Cheese Thins 37 crackers, 150g, £1.10, Morrisons 7 Morrisons biscuits are expensive and don't contain many snacks Credit: Damien McFadden I WAS surprised at the high cost of these own-brand snacks, with not a huge content per pack either. The crackers also contain the same amount of cheese powder as quite a few of the others, but had a slightly stronger and more potent waft and flavour. They were light and crunchy but I found them very dry and the overall taste did not really deliver.

        "content": "Brave victim revealed her ordeal after stepdad Gerard Lawless paid an unexpected visit to her daughters Gerard Lawless abused his stepdaughter Danielle Danielle decided to come forward when Lawless visited her children Gerard Lawless outside court Twisted child abuser Gerard Lawless Danielle when she was a child A ‘warped’ Irish soldier who served in the Lebanon normalised the sexual abuse of his five-year-old stepdaughter by telling her he’d witnessed child marriages while on duty abroad. Evil Gerard Lawless, who retired from the Irish Defence Forces in 2013, told stepdaughter Danielle that child brides consummated their marriages and then celebrated by hanging their “blood-stained sheets” in public. Details of Lawless’s twisted campaign of abuse on Danielle can be revealed for the first time today. In her first interview, given after the twisted paedophile was jailed for 10 years, she tells how: Gerard Lawless outside court “The driving force for me in waiving my anonymity,” said Danielle, “is the hope that by doing so, if there are other victims of his out there, it will encourage them to come forward. “Especially if there were little boys, because I know it can be a lot harder for a man to speak out. “But it’s out there now and they can be assured they will be believed. On the day his trial was due, Lawless (61) pleaded guilty to four counts of oral rape and seven counts of sexual assault on Danielle between 1991 and 1998. Danielle decided to come forward when Lawless visited her children The earliest count related to an incident when Danielle was aged just five, while the final two occurred when she was about 12 years old. Sentencing Lawless, Mr Justice Paul McDermott said Danielle was “in fact groomed from a very young age, inveigled into the world of Lawless’s sick games, and ended up with confused feelings throughout her childhood”. He also said he was concerned that the probation report stated that Lawless retained a “very warped view” of what happened. Speaking this week, Danielle said hearing in court that Lawless continues to maintain what occurred was “reciprocal” had shaken her. Twisted child abuser Gerard Lawless “During his interview with gardaí, he said he believed it was a kind of reciprocal relationship,” she said. “Basically, he claimed that he gave love and I gave it back to him ... that’s the sick delusion that he continues to have. “But I have two young daughters myself, and they are the ages now that I would have been when he did this to me. “And when I look at them, I think to myself that no child could ever reciprocate or want or think that they want an adult to do that to them at their young age. “The fact that he continues to have this belief boggles the mind. “He is a sick, sick individual.” Danielle said Lawless had come into her life when she was still a baby. “I was nearly two years old when he married my mother and then legally adopted me,” she said. “Even though he was my stepfather, I always just thought of him as being my dad. “I didn’t know that he wasn’t my biological father until I turned nine — and even then, it made no difference to me. Danielle when she was a child “He was just my dad. “He had a son with my mother just before I turned six. “And that’s what prompted me to remember so much about how the first incident occurred. “I was five. I remember my mother was heavily pregnant, so it happened two to three months before my sixth birthday. “That was the first count of oral rape and, from that moment, it was the beginning. “I can’t say whether this was something he had planned, if he had been subtly grooming me in different ways beforehand, because the memories aren’t there. “But after my brother was born, he was already abusing me. “And he never showed my mother any attention in that way again. “Their sexual relationship ended and she understands now why that was.” In the years that followed, Lawless lived a double life — the perfect father and community man on the one hand, while deviously preying on his stepdaughter on the other. All the while, he manipulated his innocent victim into believing there was nothing wrong. “Me and him were best friends,” Danielle recalls. “He’d bring me down to the bookies, he’d bring me for a donut, he’d bring me to the cinema. “He groomed the entire family ... he was a complete model of a man. “He was well known in the area, in the community, in the football community, and had a good reputation and was in good standing. “But it was all just an act. “And he made me believe that there was nothing wrong. “He told me he had seen child brides while he was serving overseas and that when they lost their virginity at 11 or 12, they hung the sheets with the blood up and it would be part of the party. “He also watched a lot of children’s shows on stations like Nickelodeon and made comments about the children on them ... like when he’d see a 13-year-old, he’d comment on how much of a babe she was. “It was all part of the grooming.” The abuse continued until Danielle was 12 years old, when Lawless told her “what they were doing was wrong and it should remain a secret”. And it did, until Danielle was grown up and had two daughters herself. “I went to a wedding in 2018,” Danielle said. “And with him being nearby, I asked my mam, who didn’t know anything about what happened, to look after them. “It was in my partner’s mother’s place because I didn’t want him dropping in ... I didn’t want him anywhere near my girls. “But, while we were at the wedding, he invited himself down to visit my daughters. “When I found out the next day, that was it. “That was the final straw. “I did everything I could to protect them, to stop him from being there and he managed to worm his way in. “I said ‘I can’t have this ... I cannot hide this ... I don’t ever want him laying eyes on my daughters again’.” When Danielle went to the gardaí, her case was assigned to Sgt Aisling Tidings in Clondalkin. “She was fantastic,” Danielle said. “I couldn’t have asked for anyone better.” Seeing her stepfather answer for his crimes last week has, Danielle continued, made her feel a “stronger person”. “I’m happy with the sentence,” she said. “Judge McDermott was very compassionate. “Obviously a father and grandfather himself, he was absolutely disgusted. “Gerard sat there the whole time – and he never once looked over towards any of us. “He did write an apology that he gave to the DPP. “But it was a chicken scratch of about two-and-a-half lines. “It was self-serving drivel and there was nothing in there for me. I think he is only sorry that he was caught. “Because I was so young and conditioned and groomed by him, it was my normality. “But it was never normal. “And the thing I’d most like people to take from reading this is that it’s never too late to get justice. “People like him might feel like they have gotten away with it ... they might be comfortable where they are, but it is never too late for the truth to catch them up. “It’s my hope that he never ever gets to be around any child ever again.”",

Making time away from OTAs , Raven’s shot-caller headed down to Charlotte Motor Speedway, to catch a glimpse of a rain-interrupted event. Lamar took to Instagram to give the fans highlights of his day. In his story, he appears to be watching the race from what appears to be the analysis room or some kind of special suite. After the conclusion of the race , Jackson stepped from his designated area to meet and greet the fans, other drivers, and the troops who were present at the event. 2-time NFL MVP also hopped onto an army vehicle and looked like he was having a blast. He reveled in the fact that he got to hold an army bazooka. Jackson attended the event sporting the event in driver Ryan Blaney merchandise. Lamar’s story pic.twitter.com/kmKu1xt1SZ — ayushjuneja (@Liverpudlian61) May 27, 2024 The Raven’s shot-caller was also present at Preakness Stakes. It is sufficient to say he had a memorable day as the fans showered him a lot of love at the event. It was the 127th time that the Charlotte Motor Speedway hosted the event since it opened in 1960. Jackson’s presence at the course couldn’t prevent his favorite driver from losing Lamar Jackson Supports Defending Champ Ryan Blaney Lamar came in support of defending champion Ryan Blaney at the NASCAR Coca-Cola 600 in North Carolina. Baltimore QB was covered in Blaney’s shirt. Blaney won the event last year but to Jackson’s disappointment, Ryan couldn’t repeat the feat. In a rain-interrupted shortened race, Christopher Bell emerged victorious after leading when the race was called off after 249 laps. Blaney has been the top Ford driver for the better part of the season for Team Penske . He, however, finished 39th as he collided with a wall. Ryan and Lamar however, embraced each other after the race, sharing a warm handshake. The duo chatted briefly. He also had a brief interaction with other drivers and pit crew members.

Even though he notched up another MVP, putting up his best regular season passing numbers, he couldn’t get over the postseason hump. He would be hoping to finally get his hands on that Lombardy Trophy and get that money off his back.",

        "description": "“Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.”The post Former Celtic, Hall of Famer Bill Walton dies of cancer at 71 appeared first on Boston.com.",
        "content": "By TIM REYNOLDS, Associated Press Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during basketball season. Be civil.

        "content": "In this in-depth review of the Lumix S9, we explore the newest addition to Lumix’s camera lineup from the vibrant streets of Osaka, Japan. The is a 24-megapixel full frame mirrorless camera, boasting a lightweight body at just 486 grams, making it perfect for on-the-go photography and videography. Equipped with the innovative phase detection autofocus and dual gain sensor, it promises excellent performance for both enthusiasts and professionals. Julia Trotti’s review kicks off with a look at the camera’s design and build quality. The S9 is celebrated for its sleek aesthetics, available in multiple colors, including an eye-catching green. Despite its compact size, it features a micro HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a 3.5 mm microphone port. It has a beautifully designed flat-style body, free angle LCD, and advanced hybrid autofocus. The S9 also includes a new dedicated LUT button, making this a truly shoot-and-share camera. The lack of a viewfinder, however, might be a drawback for some users. Throughout the video, Trotti tests various lenses, including the new 26mm pancake lens and the 35mm f/1.8. The S9's autofocus capabilities are demonstrated with the 24mm f/1.8 lens, showing impressive responsiveness and reliability. The review also covers the camera’s high-resolution mode, which can capture 96MP files, a feature not commonly found in cameras at this price point. For video enthusiasts, the Lumix S9 supports up to 6K video recording, with various stabilization modes tested for vlogging purposes. The review provides audio comparisons using different microphones, highlighting the camera’s sound quality capabilities. While the S9 is perfect for beginners and as a secondary camera for professionals, it has a few limitations, such as the single SD card slot and the manual focus 26mm lens. Nonetheless, its compact size and robust feature set make it an excellent choice for travel and everyday use. Overall, the Lumix S9 impresses with its blend of portability, performance, and innovative features, making it a valuable addition to the Lumix family. Whether you’re stepping up from a smartphone or looking for a versatile travel camera, the S9 has much to offer. Kim Simpson is a photographer based in the West of Scotland.

        "description": "Jackson responded to questions about the significance of Baltimore's opening matchup.",
        "content": "Most fans are excited about the first game of the season. Superstar QB and the two-time defending champion are hosting the in one of the on the slate. This is an early iteration of a 2023 AFC Championship Game rematch, with MVP looking to get his team a win this time around. Getting a game like this in front of a national audience would have most players ready for revenge. Jackson isn't like most players. In his head, Week 1 is just another stepping stone and : I really don't care who we play; it really didn't matter. At the end of the day, our goal is to make it to the Super Bowl. That sounds like a man who is locked in after in the postseason again. The rest of the league should be nervous if this is Jackson's attitude until February. He's already unstoppable as is. Will Baltimore's Offense Crack the Kansas City Defense This Time? A major reason why the Ravens didn't play in the Super Bowl last season was because the offense sputtered to a 10-point performance during the penultimate stop. They were 3-11 on 3rd down, turned the ball over thrice, and finished with only 22:30 minutes of possession. Jackson completed only 54.1% of his passes and was sacked four times. Aided by baffling play-calling from the Baltimore sideline, the Chiefs completely smothered the Ravens for most of that game. A lot of Ravens on that side of the ball should want redemption, both in Week 1 and a potential playoff rematch. In home games started by Lamar Jackson, the Baltimore Ravens averaged 34.6 points during the 2023 regular season. Their 10 points in the AFC Championship Game was an ill-timed season-low for such games. Week 1 will be a test for Baltimore's offense, especially with key addition in line to make his debut. The hope is that he will make an already elite rushing attack into a historically dominant unit. Derrick Henry's Career Statistics 2016 110 490 5 2017 176 744 5 2018 215 1,059 12 2019 303 1,540 16 2020 378 2,027 17 2021 219 937 10 2022 349 1,538 13 2023 280 1,167 12 From there, another Super Bowl is the target. Jackson is making that crystal clear: Just us beating them in the regular season doesn't really do anything; it just helps us keep stacking up wins to hopefully make it to the playoffs if anything to try to get in that same position again and hopefully be successful. 2024's season opener against the Chiefs is just another regular season game. Both of those teams will care more about what happens in January. Regardless, even if Jackson won't hype it up, September 5, 2024, will show just how much the Ravens have grown since the AFC Championship Game. A win won't signify a future parade. Revenge won't equate to a retroactive ring. However, Week 1 could spark a special season in Baltimore, with a happier ending this time. Source:",

KUWAIT CITY, May 27: As the Ministry of Electricity, Water, and Renewable Energy endeavors to secure energy from the Gulf Interconnection Authority for the coming summer, several pressing challenges persist, reports Al-Rai daily. Informed sources have highlighted three main issues currently troubling the ministry: ■ Expiration of Distributed Labor Contracts: The expiration of these contracts poses a significant concern. ■ Maintenance Tender Approvals: There has been an inability to obtain necessary approvals for station and project maintenance tenders due to the absence of the Central Tenders Agency. ■ Shortage of Basic Materials: Delays in awarding supply tenders have resulted in a lack of essential materials in some ministry sectors. These problems are particularly alarming as the summer season begins, potentially impacting the performance of various ministry sectors. Regulatory and financial authority approvals hinge on the Central Tenders Agency, exacerbating the situation. This news has been read 103 times!",

As the daughter of one of Hollywood's most famous former couples , Shiloh has lived much of her life in the spotlight, but her longtime choreographer has now spoken out to insist that the budding dancer could not be further from the stereotypical Hollywood ' nepo baby .' Shiloh, or 'Shi' to her friends and family, first wowed the world with her dance skills in 2021, when a video of her performing went viral. Now three years later - as the teenager celebrates her milestone birthday - her choreographer, Keelan Carter, has now revealed an exclusive glimpse into her life inside the dance studio. Despite boasting famous parents, dance pro Keelan tells DailyMail.com that Shiloh is determined to achieve her goals without relying on her famous name. 'Shiloh is an exceptionally talented dancer, demonstrating dedication and hard work,' the accomplished choreographer, actor and fashion designer continued. 'She is a sincere and straightforward person who never uses her celebrity status to her advantage.' Shiloh Jolie-Pitt turned 18 years old today and has become an 'exceptionally talented dancer,' her choreographer Keelan Carter (pictured together dancing) told DailyMail.com Shiloh (seen with mom Angelina Jolie, 48, on a red carpet in 2021) 'does not rely on her famous last name to achieve her goals,' Keelan - who goes by Lil Keelan Carter - said Read More Angelina Jolie is ordered to turn over every NDA she signed with a third party from 2014 to 2022 after she claimed she walked out of Miraval sale due to Brad Pitt's 'cruel' gag order 'Shi does not rely on her famous name to achieve her goals. Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio. 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her. Believe me, it is worth it.' Keelan told DailyMail.com that his recent dance videos featuring Shiloh 'were made in the same way I post any dancer who comes to my sessions or classes and whom I believe deserves to be featured.' In a video shared to his Instagram account on Wednesday featuring Shiloh and three other dancers, Keelan wrote: 'Can't wait to be back in the studio with these talented people. 'In the last period of my life, LA feels like home and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to meet so many hardworking and wonderful people. I'm glad every time to have you next to me in the studio, so thank you guys.' In the clip, the four danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza. The routine was choreographed by Keelan. Shiloh wore sweats and an oversized tee as she showcased her swift moves with Keelan writing: 'Her movement is crazy. Thank you for your energy.' Keelan has posted numerous videos featuring Shiloh, as have several of her other dance class colleagues, but the famous daughter is rarely tagged in any of the videos, as they all respect her privacy, DailyMail.com was told. Although Angelina - who worked with the the UN Refugee Agency for more than two decades, visiting camps in Cambodia, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, and Pakistan with all of her kids in tow at times - has not commented specifically on Shiloh's dance, she has spoken out about fostering the unique talents of all of her children. Keelan - an accomplished choreographer, dancer, actor, and fashion designer - has shared several video of Shiloh on his social media pages Keelan (on the left dancing to a routine he choreographed) said, 'Honestly, I didn't even know who she was at first and I don't think this matters, especially in a dance studio' In a clip on Keelan's Instagram, Shiloh danced to the song Tanzania by Uncle Waffles and Tony Duardo featuring Sino Msolo and Boibizza 'I understand that it can be difficult to see the person beyond her celebrity status, but I urge you to make an effort for her,' Keelan said of Shiloh (showing off her moves in a recent clip) 'Children should be allowed to express themselves in whatever way they wish without anybody judging them because it is an important part of their growth,' she once said in an interview with Reuters . Shiloh's dad Brad gushed about his daughter's dance ability in a 2022 i nterview with Entertainment Tonight . While promoting his film Bullet Train, he called Shiloh 'very beautiful' and said that her talent 'brings a tear the eye.' 'I don't know where she got it from. I'm Mr. Two-Left-Feet here,' Brad, now 60, told ET at time. Shiloh's parents tied the knot in August 2014 during a secret ceremony in the south of France, and welcomed three children together during their romance - Shiloh in 2006, and twins Vivienne and Knox, now 15, in 2008. They also adopted two more kids - Zahara, now 18, and Pax, now 20 - and Brad also legally adopted son Maddox, now 22, who became part of Angelina's brood before they got together. But in 2016, it came to an explosive end after the pair got into an alleged physical altercation while on a private flight with their six kids. In 2022, Shiloh showed off her skills while dancing to Doja Cat's song Vegas in a video with her instructor, Hamilton Evans (seen here) 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' a source told Us Weekly about Shiloh (seen at Millennium Dance complex) Angelina claimed that Brad 'choked' one of the children during the horrifying dispute and 'struck' another in the face, leaving her and the kids feeling like 'hostages.' Brad's rep called Angelina's account 'completely untrue' to CNN at first, but then released an amended statement to the publication that read: 'Angelina's story continues to evolve each time she tells it. 'Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn't do. He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation. 'Thankfully, the various public authorities she has tried to use against him over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done.' Despite all six kids growing up as Hollywood royalty, the Jolie-Pitt brood are all very unique. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair , Angelina said, 'Mad's a real intellectual, which I can take no credit for genetically. He's great at school, great at history. He feels like he could be a writer or travel the world and learn about places and things. 'Zahara's got an extraordinary voice and is just so elegant and well spoken. Shiloh's hysterically funny, one of the goofiest, most playful people you'll ever meet.' 'Knox and Viv are classic boy and girl. She's really female. And he's really a little dude,' the actress added. She continued: 'Shiloh dresses like a little dude. She likes to dress like a boy. She wants to be a boy. So we had to cut her hair. She likes to wear boys' everything. She thinks she's one of the brothers.' The past several years have been incredibly transformative for Shiloh. In 2021, Shiloh ditched the tomboy look when she walked the red carpet with her mom and siblings for several international premieres of Angelina's Eternals film. Looking glamorous and donning designer dresses, Shiloh set the internet ablaze at the premieres in London, Rome and Los Angeles. Since then, Shiloh has opted for a constant casual look - often being spotted in hoodies and sweatpants. She has been photographed numerous times arriving to - and leaving - dance lessons. She has since cut her hair short into a short pixie cut. Shiloh's parents Brad and Angelina married in August 2014 after 10 years together, but Angelina filed for divorce in September 2016 (seen in 2006) Shiloh (second right) is pictured in 2021 with mom Angelina and siblings Maddox, Vivienne, Knox and Zahara. She he also has older brother, Pax, who did not attend the event In a 2022 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Brad (seen with his family two years before divorce) gushed about Shiloh's dancing skills and added: 'I don't know where she got it from' Shiloh's dance talent has been recognized since 2021 when a video of her dancing to Vegas by Rihanna was shared on YouTube by LA-based choreographer Hamilton Evans. She took center stage at Millennium Dance Complex in Studio City to perform an energetic one-minute routine while flanked by two other girls. Another video saw Shiloh busting her best moves to Lizzo's About Damn Time, while the rest of her dance troupe watched on from behind. 'Shiloh loves dancing. She's seriously talented and has been going to these classes for a few years now,' an insider told Us Weekly at the time. 'She's made some good friends through the dancing community too, and they're all in chat groups and share their favorite playlists and that type of stuff. 'The teachers are all very impressed with her and say the sky's the limit if she wants to take it to the next level, and Shiloh may just do that.' The source added: 'Brad and Angie are both very proud. They'd have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they're not pushing it on her by any means.' Shiloh first made her acting debut in her father's 2008 hit film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. In 2016, the talented teen lent her voice to the character Shuai Shuai in Kung Fu Panda 3. Last week DailyMail.com revealed, Shiloh's mom Angelina was hit with another legal blow in her bitter battle with Brad over their Chateau Miraval estate. The Tomb Raider actress, 48, was ordered by a judge in LA Superior Court to produce every NDA agreement that she signed with a third-party over an eight-year period from 2014 - the year they married - to 2022. Documents detailing the judge's decision were made public as part of the ongoing 'War of the Roses,' with the A-list couple stuck in an acrimonious battle over her rights to sell their French vineyard and home.

The tight end, 34, joined teammates Patrick Mahomes and Hollywood Brown at American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas as Luka Doncic and co. sealed a dominant 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The three-time Super Bowl winner, known for his flair for fashion, sported yet another bold fit as he donned a white t-shirt with an apple on, a pair of sunglasses and the piece de resistance - a pair of jeans with diagonal mini slashes all over the legs. The risky choice caught the eye of many on social media, including the fans of his girlfriend Taylor Swift , who suggested the pop superstar could be behind it. 'What the f*** did Taylor [sic] cats do with his jeans,' one Swiftie posted alongside a photo of Travis sat courtside, joking that the songstress's cats and their claws may have gotten to his denim.

The American Airlines Center crowd wasn't exactly kind to Travis Sunday night, booing him when he was shown on screen.

The Chiefs quarterback got up and turned around to pump the crowd up with 12 minutes remaining in the second quarter. Travis is known for his flair for game-day fashion and turned heads for the Super Bowl in a custom black, sequined suit designed by Amiri, matching black t-shirt, sunglasses and chains . The outfit the Chiefs star wore was a world away from Jason, who wore red and yellow dungarees to cheer his brother on in the game.

        "content": "A man has been arrested and charged after an alleged knife attack in North Vancouver’s Deep Cove neighbourhood over the weekend, according to authorities. The North Vancouver RCMP says it received multiple reports Saturday just after 3 p.m. of a man slashing cars with a knife and attacking a motorcyclist. The suspect reportedly struck the motorcyclist’s helmet with the knife, causing him to fall, according to a news release issued Monday. The motorcyclist was not injured when he was hit by the knife, but did sustain minor injuries in the fall, police said, adding a motorist at the scene led him to safety. BC Emergency Health Services told CTV News it took one person to hospital from the scene of the incident. Several police officers were sent to the scene—near the intersection of Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road—where they arrested North Vancouver man Alexander Currie. Police allege he also assaulted an officer while in custody. On Sunday, charges against Currie were approved including attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assaulting a police officer and possession of a weapon. He is scheduled to appear in North Vancouver Provincial Court Monday afternoon. In the news release, Const. Mansoor Sahak praised the quick actions of police to safely apprehend the suspect and thanked the bystander who guided the motorcyclist to safety. Mounties are asking any witnesses to contact the detachment at 604-985-1311 and quote file number 24-10135.",

BALTIMORE (AP) — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston’s Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles’ six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore’s Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell’s 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn’t retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore’s lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox’s Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. TRAINER’S ROOM Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O’Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston’s 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "To suspend or expel them will be the end of the FijiFirst Party’s political life, and the writing is already on the wall when it is in the opposition now. FFP leader, Voreqe Bainimarama, is already suspended from Parliament and is in jail for the time being, with Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum also out of Parliament and awaiting his fate in his court case. I challenge the FFP president Ratu Joji Satakala and general-secretary Faiyaz Koya to expel the 16 Parliamentarians (MPs) who voted for the salary increase. That’s the FFP MP’s political right to exercise in Parliament for what they believe is right, and they cannot be gagged as they all deserve a pay rise. If that’s the verdict from their party constitution, then our coalition Government Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka should also either suspend or expel all five NFP parliamentarians and call for an all-out fresh national election. FijiFirst is heading for self-destruction realistically, and I would encourage the suspended MPs to form a new political party to contest the 2026 elections, as there is also too much interference from Saiyed-Khaiyum.

        "description": "All 21 New Jersey counties are under a severe thunderstorm watch through 9 p.m. Monday. Tornadoes are also possible, forecasters say.",
        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for all 21 New Jersey counties on Monday afternoon with the potential for heavy rain, wind gusts up to 65 mph, hail and even the chance for tornadoes through the evening. The watch runs through 9 p.m. on what has already been a stormy Memorial Day with multiple rounds of thunderstorms that fired up early Monday. The nasty weather caused an early mass exodus from packed Jersey Shore towns and jammed the Garden State Parkway for dozens of miles . Thousands of homes and businesses were already without power from the earlier storms and the gusty winds on the way could bring down more trees and power lines. The latest forecast for this evening’s storm is showing a reduced risk for tornadoes, but doesn’t eliminate that threat, Sarah Johnson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, told NJ Advance Media. “Damaging winds and large hail risk are more of a concern,” she said. Hail could be the size of a quarter. The morning round of storms forced several towns to cancel Memorial Day parades. ”It’s unfortunate timing, a lot of people had plans for outdoors activities and Memorial Day ceremonies had to be canceled,” Johnson said. “Unfortunately the weather didn’t cooperate.” While some parts of the state will see a lull before the evening thunderstorms, Johnson urged peopole to monitor weather forecasts closely and be prepared to get indoors. ”Our bigger concern is with another round comes after 4 p.m., and continues through the late evening hours,” she said. “There will be a lightening and a heavy rain threat, it won’t be safe to be outside.” The storm is expected it to be off shore by midnight, she said.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. ''Freedom has never been guaranteed,'' Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. ''Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.'' He added: ''On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.'' Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. ''Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. ''For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.'' Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

Passengers were told to put on life vests and prepare for a water landing out of an abundance of caution, the airline said. The Airbus A321 landed safely at Montego Bay's Sangster International Airport (MBJ) and guests deplaned normally, the airline said, adding that \"the mechanical issue did not affect flight safety.\" Passengers were put on a new flight to Fort Lauderdale, where they arrived just under 45 minutes behind schedule, according to FlightAware data . \"The pilot told us to prepare for a water landing and the highest emergency activated at MBJ,\" one passenger told the Jamaican daily newspaper The Gleaner , adding, \"We were told the aircraft lost pressure.\" The passenger added: \"It was nerve racking.\" The airline said the aircraft would be thoroughly evaluated by its maintenance team. \"We apologize to our guests for any inconvenience,\" the airline said. —Kathryn Krupnik contributed reporting.

Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is making a Memorial Day pledge that his country will continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "A PRIEST told how Eddie Hutch Jr’s death had caused “great shock in the community and for his family” at his funeral today. Fr Michael Casey said his relatives had been plunged into grief in recent times — as he read an online tribute from an anonymous member of the public. The message read: “I don’t know you Edward, only your surname. What I do know is that it has been a name laid with sadness and grief. May God comfort an already broken family.” And Fr Casey told his funeral: “That’s our prayer this morning as well. We’re aware you, his extended family, have been in this place of grief many, many times.” Mourners also heard how Eddie died before he found out he was going to be a grandfather — with his two dangerous brothers, Alan and Ross, watching today’s service online from a private room in Dublin’s Wheatfield Prison. Kinahan cartel target Patsy Hutch, dressed in a black suit and wearing glasses, carried the coffin of his nephew, who was remembered as a “quiet man, who didn’t like the limelight”. But there was no sign of his more infamous uncle, Gerry ‘The Monk’ Hutch , at the Lady of Lourdes of Church on Dublin’s Sean McDermott Street. The Monk has divided his time between Dublin and Lanzarote , in Spain, since he was acquitted of the 2016 Regency Hotel murder of Kinahan thug David Byrne in April 2023. Eddie’s dad, Eddie Sr, who was shot dead at his Dublin home days after Byrne’s murder in a revenge hit, and his mother Jenny, who died of a heart attack in February of last year, were both remembered at the funeral. His brother Christopher ‘Bouncer’ Hutch, who died of a drug overdose in 2003, was also remembered today. Another brother, Gavin Hutch, carried his remains, along with Patsy, from same church which held the funerals of both his parents. Patsy’s two sons, Derek ‘Del Boy’ and Patrick Hutch, were also in attendance. Their older brother, Gary was shot dead in Marbella, Spain, in September 2015 — kicking off the bloody Kinahan-Hutch feud which resulted in 18 murders. Eddie’s daughter Megan was among the chief mourners and the mass was told he died before she could tell him he was going to be a grandfather. The 47-year-old’s body was found at his home on Dublin’s Poplar Row on May 19. No foul play is suspected. Fr Casey told mourners: “I know many of you were concerned about Eddie. He had isolated himself and withdrew a little bit for some time.” Daughter Megan and brother Gavin brought gifts to the altar, including a portrait of him and a can of Guinness. And Eddie’s cousin Vanessa read a few words on behalf of the family, saying: “Unfortunately Edward passed before Megan got to tell him he was going to be a grandfather. “He used to have an Aller. For those who do not know it was an Alsatian dog who he absolutely adored. One of his siblings thought it was funny to play a prank on him and took the dog off for a couple of hours. “Well, the biggest search party in the history of Dublin was called. “He also took a trip down to Mosney with a couple of his mates which he had free accommodation, as you would know. He went to Dan Lowry’s, where they had fun and games. And he slipped away earlier than the rest of the crew and went back to the chalet and cooked up a storm of a big pot of stew. “When all the crew came back, which was about 3am in the morning, it was devoured. When Edward was asked where he learnt his cooking skills, he said: ‘Only in the best place — the Joy.’” After the funeral mass, Eddie’s remains were buried in Glasnevin cemetery. His heartbroken younger brothers Alan, 43, and Ross Hutch, 32, watched the funerals online at Wheatfield after their applications for temporary release from jail were rejected. A source said: “Taken into account is the safety of prison officers who would have had to escort them from the prison and stayed with them at all times. “The safety of the public is also taken into account. The two men are very volatile and a decision was made to reject their applications.”",

        "content": "Heeramandi actor Sharmin Segal once again landed in controversy after a video surfaced showing her taking a dig at costar Aditi Rao Hydari. Social media users slammed Segal’s take on Hydari during an interview while promoting the Netflix series Heeramandi, an Indian media outlet reported. Sharmin Segal referred to Aditi Rao Hydari as a “good school girl,” due to the latter’s punctuality and adherence to rules. “Aditi is a good school girl, please understand that. Teacher will say you have to submit your homework at this time and Aditi will do exactly that and not one more word than the word count limit. That is Aditi for you. So, according to her everyone is late and she is on time,” she said. It is pertinent to mention that Segal, who is Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s niece, essayed Alamzeb in the Netflix series, and was constantly criticized for her bland and expressionless performance and was even dubbed as the weakest link among the seasoned cast.

Hydari later called out the trolls targeting Segal for her performance in her uncle Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series. Addressing the backlash Segal has been receiving following her acting in the web series, Hydari called it mean and horrible. “It’s horrible to pick on anybody. I know some people like something and some people don’t. There is a way to say it. It can get very mean. It has gotten very mean and I think it’s not fair and it shouldn’t happen like that,” she said.",

        "content": "With the Joe Biden administration imposing massive new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles , some experts argue that a American-style tariff may not make sense for Canada. The U.S. move to quadruple import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to 100 per cent came on May 14, amid a major push by North American manufacturers and governments to boost the electric vehicle supply chain for the coming decades. U.S. President Joe Biden had cited unfair subsidies from the Chinese government to Chinese EV makers in announcing the import tariffs, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his government is “watching very closely.” 1:56 Fears of trade war escalating as Honda unveils home of new EV supply chain plant Canada currently imposes a six per cent tariff on Chinese-made vehicles, but the cars can qualify for up to $5,000 in federal rebates for EV purchases. Story continues below advertisement Trudeau along with Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne and Trade Minister Mary Ng haven’t ruled out the possibility of similar tariffs, but none of them committed to following suit. The decision, economists said, is a complex one. Moshe Lander, economics professor at Concordia University, told Global News, “If Canada wants to put tariffs on China, that’s within their control. They don’t have to do it just because the Americans are doing it.” “In a lot of cases, we’ve been treating countries differently than the Americans because we see their strategic threat to us as different than the Americans,” Lander said. More on Canada Canada getting ‘closer’ to key NATO defence spending target, minister says Indigo set to go private after shareholders vote in favour of deal Canada mulling import tariffs on Chinese-made EVs after U.S. move Quebec court authorizes class action against Bombardier Erik Johnson, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said Canada’s context is very different from a large economy like the United States. He said China is Canada’s second largest trade partner and a back-and-forth over EV tariffs could hurt Canada in other sectors, like agriculture where China could impose retaliatory tariffs, and has done so in the past. “Canada certainly could stand to lose a fair bit in that back and forth with China over electric vehicle tariffs. So we do have to approach the conversation a little bit differently than maybe a big country like the United States that doesn’t rely necessarily on external markets to the same degree,” Johnson said. A recent Scotiabank report said North American manufacturers were falling behind in the global race to build more EVs. In the last quarter of 2023, Chinese auto giant BYD dethroned Tesla as the leading manufacturer of EVs in the world. Story continues below advertisement “North American policymakers need to ratchet up regional collaboration. Erecting barriers might buy time, but not necessarily edge as the Europeans are learning the hard way,” the Scotiabank report said. 2:24 Ontario nets new electric vehicle investment, this time in Niagara Region Should Canada align with U.S. markets? Experts say while Canada should consider its unique context, it cannot afford to deviate too far from the U.S. economy. Story continues below advertisement “I think that’s the difficult tightrope you have to walk there,” Johnson said. “Canada really does need to stay in line with the United States for the main reason that almost every car we make ourselves is not necessarily being sold domestically. Roughly 80 per cent of the vehicles we assemble in this country are going south of the border.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Lander said, “In Canada, you really can’t get to scale with 40 million consumers the way you can with an integrated North American market that has over 500 million consumers.” While Chinese-made EVs accounts for a very small portion of the North American EV market, Johnson said it could change very quickly. “Five years ago, (almost) no Chinese-made EVs were being sold in Europe. And today... about 15 per cent of overall vehicle imports to the EU are coming from China. And all of those are electric vehicles,” he said. While allowing Chinese-made EVs into the market may mean the price drops dramatically for Canadian consumers, both Lander and Johnson said that would mean Ottawa would have to contend with potential national security concerns over Chinese companies. 0:36 $1.6B lithium-ion battery plant to be built in Ontario Trending Now ‘General Hospital’ actor Johnny Wactor shot, killed during attempted robbery Thousands of NÜTRL tumblers recalled after dozens report illness Johnson said by not following Washington, Ottawa risks inviting U.S. tariffs on Canada: in particular, if “the U.S. thinks that they need to impose some differential tariffs on us, because maybe we’re allowing a little bit too much infiltration into our market from electric vehicles from China.” Story continues below advertisement In addition to U.S. fears of China using Canada as a backdoor market for their goods, the upcoming presidential election also raises questions. Lander said Canadian should be wary of protectionist sentiments creeping back into American politics ahead of the November election. He said Canada’s competition may not come from China, but from U.S. states with looser labour laws. “It’s the southern U.S. states like Tennessee and Alabama that have much weaker labour laws and can produce cars for the North American market within the NAFTA agreement, where Canada is not going to be able to compete,” he said. 1:55 Can Canada be a leader in mining critical minerals for EV battery supply chains? What about Canadian jobs? Last month, it was announced that Japanese automaker Honda is putting $15 billion into their Ontario operations with a new electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ont. with a joint $5 billion coming from the federal and Ontario governments. Story continues below advertisement Johnson said, “That facility is going to add an additional thousand jobs. Just from a dollars-to-jobs point of view, you’re looking at roughly $5 million per job. So, certainly an expensive way to create new jobs in this country relative to other options.” In the long term, he said the Canadian economy could if new jobs come from retrofitting infrastructure and spending public money on light rail development, subway development and public transportation subsidies. Johnson said that despite being behind most major players, Canada can still cash in on the global EV boom using its abundance of critical minerals. “Canada does have a lot of the endowments that can make it a very important player in this space,” he said. “If you want to make a battery today, most of those minerals are predominantly coming from China. It does certainly give us an avenue to create a supply chain that will find a global audience.”",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM - Liverpool's Dutch contingent are looking forward to the arrival of compatriot Arne Slot at the club as manager next season with club captain Virgil van Dijk committed to staying at Anfield. Van Dijk said he had already spoken to Slot and that he was eagerly awaiting the next campaign and working under the former Feyenoord coach, who takes over from Juergen Klopp. \"I still have a year left on my contract. I am club captain and I have made it clear I am there for the new coach and enthusiastic over the next season,\" Van Dijk said on Monday as the Netherlands began their training camp for the European Championship. \"Obviously, there will be a lot of changes but I am confident we will make a big success of it. \"I congratulated him of course and I'm really pleased for him and his family. We spoke about the team and the future but now my focus is fully on the national team,\" he told Dutch television. Ryan Gravenberch said Slot had proven his worth at Feyenoord, where he won the Dutch league last season and the cup this term. \"I think he can be good for my career, it's a coach who wants to play good football,\" said the 22-year-old midfielder, who signed from Bayern Munich last August. Slot was named Liverpool manager last week as Klopp departed after a nine-year managerial reign. REUTERS",

        "description": "The former president promised a crackdown on-campus protests, which have swept across the country over the past few months, as he spoke at a roundtable event in New York earlier this month",
        "content": "Donald Trump told campaign donors that, should he return to the White House in November, he would deport pro-Palestinian student demonstrators in order to get them to “behave”. The former president promised a crackdown on campus protests – that have swept across the country over the past few months – as he spoke at a roundtable event in New York earlier this month. “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” Mr Trump said, according to event attendees, who spoke to The Washington Post anonymously. According to the sources, the former president joked that the group of donors at the event encompassed “98 per cent of my Jewish friends”. Protests have swept US college campuses since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel , which killed about 1,200 people. The ensuing Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. At the roundtable event on 14 May, one of the donors present complained that many of the students and professors protesting on campuses could one day hold positions of power in the US. Mr Trump said that the demonstrations were a “radical revolution” that he promised to defeat, per The Post. Referencing efforts by the New York Police Department (NYPD) to clear protests at Columbia University last month, he praised the force and said that nationwide protests needed to be “stopped now”. “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,” he said, according to the donors who spoke to The Post . The former president has made sweeping statements about the war in the Middle East, saying that it is time to “get back to peace and stop killing people”. According to The Post, Republican donors have recently lobbied him to take a stronger stance backing Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu . The Post reported, per its sources, that Mr Trump told donors behind closed doors that he supports Israel’s right to continue its “war on terror”. He has repeatedly claimed that the attack by Hamas on 7 October would have never happened if he were president at the time. The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment about reports. It comes as the Biden administration faces strong calls to condemn Mr Netanyahu, after Israeli forces conducted an airstrike on tents in Rafah, meant for displaced Palestinians. The attack on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured dozens more, according to Gaza health authorities. Mr Netanyahu subsequently called the strike “a tragic mistake” and said that it would be investigated. On Monday, Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, wrote on X: “Genocidal maniac Netanyahu told us he wants to ethically cleanse Palestinians. When are you going to believe him @POTUS?”",

        "content": "Officials are urging people to avoid a stretch of the north Oregon coast after a dead humpback whale washed ashore Monday morning. The whale came ashore on the sands of Nehalem Bay State Park, just south of Manzanita, prompting warnings from the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All three agencies issued warnings Monday on posts to social media as well as signs on the beach. The area where the whale washed ashore is also a protected area for endangered snowy plovers, making it especially vulnerable to intrusions. “We’re asking people to please stay away from the carcass so it remains undisturbed,” Michael Milstein, a spokesperson for NOAA Fisheries, said Monday. “We intend to do an initial exam today to see what we can learn about possible cause of death.” The dead whale arrives as authorities are still busy investigating the source of that has been washing up on Oregon beaches and endangering wildlife. On Monday, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said the substance to be petroleum based, but offered no other details, as responders continue to survey beaches in Oregon and Washington. Department spokesperson Beth Quillian said investigators are aware of the dead whale, but have not determined whether there is any connection to the tar-like substance. “We’re not going to know a cause of death at least for a week,” Quillian said. Dead whales are certainly not uncommon on the Oregon coast. Aside from the recent spate of dead gray whales, the ocean beaches have long been a repository for expired marine animals, including sharks, sea lions and all manner of strange fish. It’s also not unusual to see humpback whales off the Oregon coast this time of year, Milstein said, as the whales are currently migrating north from their breeding grounds in central America, with some passing along the Pacific coast. Dead whales are often , as the carcasses provide food for eagles and other scavengers. The agencies said they will determine what to do with the whale after their analysis. The dead humpback at Nehalem Bay is located in a more remote part of the state park, officials said, a decent walk from the nearest access road. -- covers travel and the outdoors and co-hosts the .

        "content": "BALTIMORE — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston's Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles' six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore's Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore's lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell's 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn't retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore's lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox's Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. TRAINER'S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O'Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was ''most likely'' to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston's 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "content": "A teacher has gone viral on TikTok after one of his students posted a video of him playing the guitar to 50 Cent’s iconic hit ‘Candy Shop,’ leaving viewers impressed. While some teachers act more professionally during the day than others, it’s safe to say that most of them have a “fun side.” Many of them have secret talents, while into their class. TikToker Ava3767’s History teacher decided to show his fun side right before summer break, bringing his headless guitar to class to show off his talents by playing 50 Cent’s iconic song ‘Candy Shop’. “My history teacher went crazy,” read the text on the video. Users flooded the comments shocked at how good the teacher is at playing the guitar. “He’s the one making history,” one said. Another commented: “I swear every teacher has one insane talent outside of their profession.” “I love when teachers show their lore,” a third replied. After being floored by the first video going viral and gaining 3.5M views, Ava posted a second clip of her teacher playing the popular song. With 1.5M views and hundreds of comments just a day after uploading the second clip, viewers continued to be impressed with the teacher. “He looks like Yung Gravy and Matthew Lillard had a love child,” one user replied. Another commented: “I didn’t realize this song needed electric guitar. I’ll never hear it the same way again.” Teachers going viral on TikTok is far from a new phenomenon, thanks to the millions of different things that can happen inside a classroom.

        "description": "'Calgarians have really embraced the Green Cart program right from when it rolled out'",
        "content": "Expansion of the Calgary Composting Facility, one of the largest of its kind in Canada, is set to ease pressure brought by growing demand for the city’s green cart program. Tanner Fellinger, the city’s manager of utilities delivery, called the 60,000-tonne processing capacity expansion a “significant milestone” towards a greener future. Fellinger pointed to the success of the green cart program, which is funding 85 per cent of the $89.6-million expansion, . “We’re set to increase our capacity by 60 per cent, which translates to an impressive 160,000 tonnes of food and yard waste on an annual basis,” said Mayor Jyoti Gondek at Monday’s press event. “This is a really good example of Calgarians being given access to a way in which they can practice greener and (more) sustainable methods of dealing with their waste,” Gondek said. Construction began in April, with completion expected in late 2025. Other funding avenues include federal funding through low interest loans and grants from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and Natural Resources Canada. “It’s really difficult to do things like this on our own as a municipality, as our funding sources are so limited, and so to have good partners that were willing to come forward with funds – really did make this happen,” said Gondek. A feature of the expansion, the ‘anerobic digestion system’ will allow biogas to be captured as , reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also allows for some volumes to be processed more quickly, says organic program manager Craig More. “Calgarians have really embraced the green cart program right from when it rolled out,” said More. “Overall we’re seeing an upward trend year over year.” The facility receives up to 200 truckloads of food and yard waste a day during the busiest times of the year, More said. The expansion and new anerobic process will not worsen odours from the facility, and the process will be fully enclosed, said More. “All that air is going to be captured and treated, and then it will be turned into renewable natural gas.” Ward 12 Coun. Evan Spencer said the existing facility has been at capacity for quite a while. “It was just years after it opened (in ) that it crested into essentially over its operational capacity,” Spencer said. More said that several strategies were in place to handle higher than anticipated tonnage. “When the facility was originally designed it had some ‘contingency capacity’ built in, as councillor Spencer mentioned that was used up essentially right away,” said More. Other streams of material they are able to “adjust” how much they’re receiving when they’re receiving a lot of Green Cart material according to More. “We’ve gone to essentially a 24/7 operation to continue processing that – we truly have successfully processed the vast majority of the Green Cart material that is collected,” More said. The expansion is meant to get the city through the next several years, said Fellinger, noting that it is dependent on the “rapid growth of Calgary”. “This expansion ensures our city remains at the forefront of sustainable waste management practices,” Fellinger said. –",

        "description": "A bill that would ban federal employers from using replacement workers or 'scabs' during lockouts or strikes passed the House of Commons unanimously on Monday.",
        "content": "A bill that would ban federal employers from using replacement workers or \"scabs\" during lockouts or strikes passed the House of Commons unanimously on Monday. MPs from all parties voted in favour of the so-called \"anti-scab\" legislation, seeing it pass 316-0. Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan tabled the labour legislation in November 2023, satisfying a commitment under the minority Liberals' confidence-and-supply deal with the NDP. Unveiling Bill C-58 – backed by MPs and union representatives – the minister framed the move as \"the biggest thing to happen to collective bargaining in Canada, in decades,\" and braced for resistance from the Conservatives that did not materialize. On Monday, O'Regan welcomed the all-party backing. \"It's not necessary, but I think on historic legislation like this, it's certainly very, very welcome,\" he said. \"And I think it is a real message to workers right across this country, that they are valued and that parliamentarians have heard them.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre and Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet cast their votes \"yea\" virtually, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh voted in-favour, in-person. The legislation is set to apply to an estimated one million employees, working for approximately 22,350 federally regulated employers, excluding the public service. The legislation allows for an exemption where replacement workers can do the work of union members during work stoppages, in cases where there are threats to health and safety, or serious environmental or property damage that could not be managed by the existing workforce. Singh, who credits his party for forcing the Liberals to advance these \"historic\" protections for unionized jobs after a \"decades-long fight,\" celebrated the forthcoming passage before question period on Monday. \"With the incredible work of union leaders, of union activists, of workers, with the work of New Democrats who've been championing this for over 15 years ... we can say today we will finally pass a law that will once and for all ban scab workers at the federal level,\" Singh said. His intention is to next turn attention on the provinces and territories, in hopes those that don't already have comparable protections advance similar legislation to ban scab workers \"at every level across this country.\" This is an effort O'Regan said he's already started. The Liberals and New Democrats framed the Conservatives' position on Bill C-58 as a test of whether Poilievre was genuinely fighting to be an advocate for workers' rights. In February – after being accused of trying to distract from stating their position on the legislation – the Conservatives joined the other parties in voting to support the bill in principle, seeing it unanimously pass on to committee for further study. MPs who scrutinized the legislation and heard from stakeholders did pass a series of amendments to the bill earlier this month. Among the changes made was to prohibit employees from another workplace, volunteers, or students from being used as replacement workers. Monday's vote comes as union leaders and labour groups voice caution about Poilievre's working class rhetoric, citing his past voting record on back-to-work legislation and other failed anti-scab bills. Among those who have questioned Poilievre's commitment to Canadian workers is Canadian Labour Congress president Bea Bruske. Accompanying Singh to herald the then-anticipated passage of the bill on Monday, Bruske didn't mention the Official Opposition leader in her remarks, but thanked Minister O'Regan and the NDP for getting the legislation over the finish line. \"It's incredibly important that we level the playing field at the bargaining table. And this legislation does exactly that,\" she said. \"No worker in Canada should ever have to worry about their job being replaced by a replacement worker. That is not fair. That is not right.\" Trudeau recently touted his government's work on this policy as part of a speech to one of the largest unions in North America, during a trip to Philadelphia , casting himself as a champion of the working class while seeking to draw contrast with the Conservatives. The Liberals had stated Bill C-58 was among their priority pieces of legislation to pass the House before the summer hiatus. The bill will now undergo a second round of scrutiny in the Senate. Should the legislation receive royal assent, it is expected to take 12 months to see the suite of new protections and related procedures come into force, instead of the initially proposed 18 months, due to one of the committee reforms made to the bill. It was a reform O'Regan said he pushed for after hearing the groups that'll be stickhandling much of the new regime, such as the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the Canada Industrial Relations Board, could be ready in less time. \"The last thing that I wanted was to fundamentally change how negotiating in the federal sector takes place and then not have the resources or the ability there to make sure that we see it through,\" the minister said, vowing adequate funding to enact the new \"anti-scab\" provisions. Once law, any contravention from federal employers could be punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 per day.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, on Monday inaugurated the Inter-Ministerial Task Team (IMTT). The Executive Secretary of NEITI, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, said the essence of the task team is to study very carefully each NEITI industry report of the Oil, Gas and Solid minerals sectors as well as the Fiscal Allocation and Statutory Disbursement (FASD) report, map out the key findings and recommendations in these reports and identify the agencies that are responsible, to carry out the remedial actions as recommended by the Independent Administrators. “The IMTT is also expected to map out strategies that will track and report on the progress made towards the implementation of the findings and recommendations in the NEITI reports. “The objective is to ensure that NEITI does not just publish reports that gather dust on the shelves of the agency, but that the findings of these reports help to deepen government oversight and reform of the oil, gas and mining sectors for productivity, transparency and accountability in a manner that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of Nigerians who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the natural resources endowed in the country. “Your assemblage today, is a reunion from what we established in the past. NEITI has envisaged that the reforms that are taking place in Nigeria’s extractive sector especially, the implementation of the Solid Minerals Roadmap and the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) would have taken over the work of the IMTT, but recent developments have clearly shown that the IMTT has come to stay and remains relevant due to its unique composition and responsibility. “The last EITI validation and the recent international mission conducted by the EITI in Nigeria, equally identified the need for the IMTT and reinforced NEITI’s position that the task team should be invigorated and strengthened to help oversee the implementation of NEITI reports recommendations. “NEITI is therefore convinced that the IMTT framework is better positioned to meet the challenges identified in the governance framework that has been put in place for the extractive sector. “NEITI is also of the view that the achievements and impacts it has recorded in the sector will be tracked and documented under the framework of the IMTT. This is against the background that the IMTT structure will support in tracking and measurement of where we are, where we should be and how we could get there. “The National Stakeholders Working Group (NSWG) also known as the Board of NEITI has expanded the Inter-Ministerial Task Team -IMTT to serve as the forum for both remediation and government engagements. The IMTT is to be chaired by the office of the SGF. “Let me use this opportunity to announce that today we have a NEITI National Stakeholders Working Group in place, it was inaugurated last week by the President with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as the Chairman. “We are therefore very honoured to have in our midst, representatives from the key agencies that we are closely working with: they include, the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), NNPCLtd, the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) RAMFAC and Ministry of Petroleum Resources. “We also have as members, the Central Bank of Nigeria, Office of the Auditor General of the Federation, Ministry of Solid Minerals Development, Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the Corporate Affairs Commission, Niger Delta Development Commission and the Mining Cadastre Office amongst others. “We also have in our midst today, representatives of these organisations officers who are not lower than a director. We are confident that the IMTT members will take leadership on how the NEITI findings and recommendations are implemented in their various organizations and agencies. “The progress and traction we gain in implementing these recommendations is expected to feed into key government policies, goals and impact in the ongoing reforms under the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s administration and the 2023 EITI Standard. “NEITI has also since commenced the conduct of its 2022/2023 industry reports of the Oil, Gas and Solid Minerals sector. Our scope of coverage is very wide and the outcome of this very important industry reports covering companies doing business in both sectors will be very insightful for the government, the legislature, the civil society and the international development partners as well as investors interested in investing in Nigeria’s extractive sector. “Transparency and accountability of transactions and operations of the sector are key to making investment decisions concerning the sector. The EITI report globally and NEITI reports in Nigeria have constituted a very important benchmark for measuring adherence to the noble ideals across the globe. “NEITI is determined to publish the 2022-2023 reports by September, 2024. We are grateful to President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, the National Assembly, the Civil Society Organizations working closely with us, and the companies under the umbrella of the NEITI-Companies forum as well as the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce (OPTS) and in particular the miners Association of Nigeria for their cooperation and partnership in working together with NEITI. “We also wish to thank our partners, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), ICPC, NFIU and other anti-corruption agencies that are working with NEITI, and also closely monitoring this process that we are very confident of their cooperation and support especially for non-compliance by some covered entities. “We therefore call on all the covered entities that will be covered by this report to give us their full cooperation. We also warn that adherence, timely provision of information and data by relevant government agencies and companies covered by this process are very fundamental, mandatory and a requirement” stated Dr. Orji.",

        "content": "Public transportation services will soon expand and improve throughout the region thanks to an influx of state money that the two transit authorities that cover Franklin and Hampshire counties will use to buy new accessible vehicles and implement several new transportation programs for increased connectivity in rural areas. The Franklin Regional Transit Authority (FRTA) and Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) and will receive a portion of $37 million being awarded through competitive grant programs that was recently announced by the Healey-Driscoll administration. The PVTA, through the Community Transportation Grant Program, is poised to receive $188,008 to help acquire 29 accessible vehicles, 25 of which will provide general coverage in the PVTA service area of Hampshire and Hampden counties. The remaining four vehicles will be awarded to councils on aging. The Easthampton and Amherst councils on aging will each receive one accessible vehicle, while the Tri-Town Trolley service, which runs in East Longmeadow, Longmeadow, and Hampden, will receive two accessible vans. The goal of these vehicle purchases is to “facilitate and support transportation for older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income individuals in the region,” according to Brandy Pelletier, PVTA’s manager of marketing, advertising and public relations and clerk to its advisory board. PVTA intends to use some of these vehicles to launch a new “Connecting Rural Communities” service, which is “designed to increase accessibility within the rural communities of Greenfield, Leverett, Sunderland and Amherst,” according to authority. The service will be provided cooperatively with PVTA’s grant partners: South County Senior Center, Amherst Council on Aging and PVTA’s ADA Paratransit provider MV Transit. “The proposed service expands mobility options for all residents to access medical care, education, and employment and other needs by offering direct transportation links between Amherst and Greenfield. The less populated communities, Leverett and Sunderland, will add new connections that did not previously exist,” said Pelletier. The route will initially operate from Monday to Friday with three daily round trips from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Service will leave Amherst at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 1 p.m. It will leave Greenfield at 10 a.m., 12 p.m., and 2 p.m. Article continues after... PVTA also filed a joint application for Regional Transit Innovation Grant funding with the Franklin Regional Transit Authority and the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority to rehabilitate seven buses and start a pilot program interconnecting the three service areas. This program would provide connections to rural areas between Pittsfield and Northampton as well as between North Adams and Greenfield. “This new pilot service will open the possibilities for residents to expand their employment, education, and social opportunities,” said Pelletier. “It will also address inequities in transportation options available to rural residents.” The grant for this collaborative effort totals $4,610,701. PVTA was also individually awarded $82,133 through the Regional Transit Innovation Grant for its proposed Connecting Individuals to Employment Program. The program will provide transportation that connects eligible individuals living in Amherst and surrounding areas to employment opportunities in Hatfield, Whatley and Deerfield. “This service will provide access to those identified by Craig’s Doors and other social services as unhoused that are seeking employment by connecting these individuals to rural communities where jobs are available,” PVTA said. Transportation through this program is limited, and will only be available to riders who live in or around Amherst and are seeking employment in one of the three service towns. Service will be available to those who use homeless shelter services as well, and individuals will be screened for eligibility by local organizations. The money for local transit authorities is part of $37 million statewide. Of that total, the Community Transportation Grant Program will award almost $20 million for the purchase of vehicles and over $2 million for mobility and accessibility-expanding projects, while the Regional Transit Innovation Grant provides $15 million in operating and capital funding, according to the state Department of Transportation. “We are excited to announce these grant funds because we know the money will go a long way to supporting the needs of organizations that provide mobility options across the state,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. “Public transportation plays a crucial role when it comes to accessibility, community connectivity, and economic growth and we will work to ensure that all residents have access to the transportation services they need.”",

CALGARY – An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government’s proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada’s non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada’s conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government’s draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government’s draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 per cent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030.

        "content": "CALGARY — An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government's proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada's non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada's conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government's draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government's draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 per cent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030.

Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston's Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles' six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases.

A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell's 2-2 changeup the opposite way . Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn't retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore's lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox's Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close.

In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded.

        "content": "CALGARY — An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government's proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada's non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada's conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government's draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 per cent. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government's draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 per cent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Avon Police visited the Lorain County Commission meeting earlier this month to request access to criminal felony records they cannot access because they’re in the county’s New World Systems database. “I’m respectfully requesting from the commissioners that Avon Police Department be given immediate access to law enforcement records from the New World system,” Avon Police Officer James Drozdowski told the commission. Currently, the department has 27 cases that have been ordered to be either sealed or expunged by area judges from the common pleas, municipal and domestic relations divisions, Drozdowski said. “I am unable to follow through to give them relief because we can’t get in the system,” he said. Drozdowski spent two days at the Lorain County Prosecutor’s office in an effort to straighten out the situation, however it remains unresolved. “We know the evidence is there,” Drozdowski said. “It’s frustrating to the detectives. It’s frustrating to us. And it’s unfair to the victims.” There are several open investigations, some of which were scheduled for hearings this month, that include major offenses such as narcotics and violent crimes where some information is missing because of the department’s inability to access the information. “The prosecutors are going into court basically with one hand tied behind their backs,” Drozdowski told the commission. “They don’t know if they have the full files.” Commission President Jeff Riddell addressed the matter at a meeting May 20 with a written statement. “Based on the City of Avon’s actions, by failing to extend the 2014 agreement as it relates to its Police Department with the New World System beyond the initial 10-year term ending in 2023, the Avon Police Department no longer has direct access to the System or the archived data under the terms of that agreement,” read Riddell’s statement. “In an effort to be good partners in serving the residents of Lorain County and the residents of the City of Avon, the County Prosecutors Office and the Board of County Commissioners have made and continue to make available to Avon access to its archived data. Additionally, Avon, at its discretion, currently has the ability to contract directly with Tyler Technologies, for a fee, for access its their archived data.” “The argument that Mr. Drozdowski made, on behalf of the City of Avon, that upwards of 27 cases are in various phase of prosecutorial jeopardy or other legal action is at the feet of the County falls flat on its merits,” the statement also said. “It is the City of Avon, at the direction of its Police Chief, that voluntarily opted not to continue with the New World System. In the City’s haste to leave the New World System to use a different platform – Sundance, Avon failed to plan and migrate the data from one System to another. The City of Avon could have avoided this situation by either not leaving New World or by adequately planning the transition from one system to another.”",

        "description": "After the day-long summations, Justice Juan Merchan will give jurors instructions on the law.",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s trial in New York is nearing an end. On May 28, the prosecution and defense will sum up their cases, allowing jurors to deliberate on their verdict. The Manhattan District Attorney has charged President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records to the first degree, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Throughout the trial, prosecutors have shown emails, texts, phone call logs, contracts, and other documentation in efforts to establish that there was a scheme in place to influence the 2016 presidential election, and an effort to conceal it in the creation of 11 payments to ex-lawyer Michael Cohen. They have argued that the records speak for themselves and are evidence of intent to defraud. However, the records are of mixed relevance. Some were directly related to the $420,000 payment to Mr. Cohen, while others included text conversations unrelated to the events of the case, or even book excerpts from old Trump books on business advice. During jury selection, prosecutors had used the example of a man hiring a hitman which seemed to annoy the defense, arguing that the man would be guilty even though he had not pulled the trigger. They may remind jurors that the prosecutors needed to show that President Trump caused false records to be created, but not that he created them himself. The rest of the 22 witnesses were called by prosecutors, largely to enter records into evidence, except for a few who gave lengthy, narrative testimonies, during which defense attorneys seized upon inconsistencies. Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult performer Stormy Daniels, and Mr. Cohen are considered to be at the center of the case because the 34 business records comprising the charges are only falsified if it is found that they were created to cover up a scheme necessitating this payment. However, both witnesses were at times argumentative and evasive on the stand, gave inconsistent details, and acknowledged their animosity toward President Trump and financial interest in criticizing him publicly. Defense attorneys are likely to cast them both as opportunists. President Trump has denied an alleged sexual encounter with Ms. Clifford, and the defense pointed out during cross-examination of Ms. Clifford that she told different accounts of the alleged encounter at different times, and suggested her inconsistent claims about why she came out with her story showed motivation to extort. The defense attorneys have argued that Mr. Cohen is a liar, pointing to his track record of lying under oath and possibly to his new admission of stealing at least $30,000 from the Trump Organization by requesting more than he was owed for a payment he made to Red Finch for polling services. Two other witnesses gave longer testimonies, but much of it had been to provide context for an alleged scheme. David Pecker, former head of American Media Inc., testified for a week about stories he bought to suppress because he believed they would harm the Trump campaign. However, neither of those stories was related to the charges. Keith Davidson, attorney for Ms. Clifford, testified at length, offering color and context to the agreement Mr. Cohen entered into with Ms. Clifford. Mr. Davidson made it clear on the witness stand that the non-disclosure agreement they signed was a completely legal contract, something defense attorneys are likely to remind jurors. Defense attorneys will also be restricted from explaining the law to jurors, but they are likely to remind the jury that the non-disclosure agreement, popularly termed “hush money” by prosecutors, is completely legal, as is influencing an election through lawful means.",

        "description": "Indigo secured approval from its shareholders on Monday to go private. Here's how that could change the Canadian retailer going forward.",
        "content": "A bid to exit publicly traded markets could give Indigo Books & Music the “nimbleness” needed for the struggling retailer to execute on its comeback plans, according to some analysts. Shareholders voted Monday in favour of a $2.50 per share offer from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P., which already held a 56 per cent stake in Indigo and are owned by Gerald Schwartz, the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman. Some 95 per cent of votes cast from shareholders represented at Monday’s meeting were in favour of the proposed deal, which marks a more than 69 per cent bump in share price from where Indigo’s stock was at the time of the initial offer. Indigo has said it expects the transaction to close in June and its shares to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange sometime after. Story continues below advertisement “We are pleased with the result of today’s vote and look forward to continuing our work on Indigo’s transformation strategy,” Reisman said in a statement following the vote. “We remain deeply committed to our customers and to all our stakeholders as we work together to inspire reading and enrich the lives of booklovers across the country.” Indigo’s fortunes on the public markets have dwindled since the turn of the millennium, when shares traded for nearly $35 on the TSX. In recent years, the retailer has struggled to rebound from a cyberattack that knocked down its e-commerce capabilities for months and a management shake-up that saw Reisman return to the helm last September to fill the void left by departing executives and board members. 0:20 Heather Reisman returning to Indigo following abrupt exit of former CEO In its latest earnings report in February , Indigo said third-quarter profits dropped roughly 70 per cent to $10 million from $34.3 million a year earlier. Story continues below advertisement Revenues for the quarter that ended Dec. 30, 2023 were $370.6 million, down from $422.7 million during the same quarter in 2022. To turn things around, Indigo has been carrying out a transformation plan since at least November. It’s offered few specifics, but Reisman, who founded the chain in 1996, has said it is meant to “return Indigo to both growth and profitability.” Manoj Raheja, partner at strategy and consultancy firm Sklar Wilton & Associates, tells Global News that going private allows a publicly traded company to make the changes it needs to for the business to become profitable without worrying about having to file quarterly earnings and respond to shareholder concerns.

Financial news and insights delivered to your email every Saturday. Sklar Wilton & Associates has previously done consulting work with Indigo, but not for the past three years. Retail analyst and author Bruce Winder says that Indigo has some “tough work” ahead of it, which can be difficult to accomplish in the public eye and could have led to an even steeper dip in valuation if not for the privatization bid. Indigo can also move faster without having to worry about getting stakeholder approval for whatever pivot the ownership team feels can salvage the business, he says. Story continues below advertisement “That definitely gives them the nimbleness they need to make some pretty drastic changes.” What is Indigo’s ‘customer promise’? For Indigo’s ownership group, taking a company private also means putting a significant investment in the retailer – both upfront and going forward to turn the business around, Raheja says. Whether a company is private or public, Raheja says successful retailers have to be “maniacal” about keeping their “customer promise.” Companies like Costco and McDonald’s know this truth well, he says, and are diligent about pushing back when “the Street” – shorthand for shareholders and analysts in the stock market – puts pressure on an operator to squeeze margins at the expense of the customer, he says. “Regardless of the Street, you have to put your customer at the centre of everything,” he says. Story continues below advertisement What exactly that “customer promise” is has shifted for Indigo in recent years. 0:40 Indigo won’t pay ransom to hackers, says stolen employee data may appear on ‘dark web’ this week When Amazon burst onto the scene and took an enormous chunk of the bookselling space with its innovative online retail channels, one of Indigo’s responses was to shift into lifestyle goods. Trending Now Government by Gmail: Doug Ford’s chief of staff used private email for ‘political discussions’ 369 stolen vehicles from Ontario worth $33M recovered, many at Port of Montreal Winder says that while the company might’ve seen some initial traction in the space, interest dried up and the vertical “became a burden for them.” Winder says that as Indigo weighs its turnaround plan, there is likely an opportunity to cut back the retailer’s physical footprint. With renegotiated leases with landlords and suppliers, Indigo could save on critical cash in the turnaround, he says, and could end up trimming the size of its workforce through layoffs. “You’ll probably see, maybe a smaller footprint, potentially a more focused footprint that’s much more about books and much less about lifestyle products,” he says. Story continues below advertisement The Canadian Press notes that some Indigo stores have lately seen wellness products and the popular American Girl dolls culled from their shelves and Columbus Café & Co. has moved into some Indigo spaces previously held by Starbucks. Reisman has also pledged in newsletters to bring back its digital inventory search kiosks, program more events and add seating to more stores. What future Indigo stores look like could depend in part on the success of the new flagship store unveiled last fall in Toronto’s The Well development, Winder adds. Reisman pitched that redesigned concept store as a space for kids to do arts and crafts while a jukebox played in the background. Winder says that while a few Indigo stores across Canada could pull off the kind of cultural and experiential pivot imagined in The Well, he believes the way forward for the brand is likely less “pomp and circumstance” and a refocus on how to be “best in class in books.” Raheja says forging a new customer promise will mean targeting a specific group where Indigo sees growth potential. That could mean new parents on maternity and paternity leave looking for a place to escape, retirees in Canada’s aging population or even current workers with remote and hybrid arrangements who are looking for a change in scenery. “I won’t pretend to know which group they want to bring in, but I would say the opportunity is to serve those groups, create programming that is going to deliver on their promise,” he says. Story continues below advertisement That’s easier said than done, Raheja notes, with increasing competition for Canadians’ time. But a compelling new purpose for Indigo, in his mind, could be enough to restore the company to its former glory. “There’s zero doubt in my mind that a retailer with Indigo’s background, with its image in Canada, that it can be successful,” he says. Winder says the challenge ahead of Indigo remains steep, even as a private company. Younger generations are increasingly comfortable buying online, and Amazon will likely remain the go-to destination for this future force in commerce. He wishes Indigo “nothing but the best” but adds “unfortunately, the landscape’s changed since when they had their heyday.” With some nod to the creative spark that Indigo has sought to inspire, however, Winder says it would be unwise to assume exactly what’s in store for the retailer’s next chapter. “That’s the fun in retail, you never know what’s around the corner.” – with files from The Canadian Press 2:08 How the rise of Temu and Shein created a logistical nightmare for the air freight industry",

        "description": "The veteran defender has had his Ibrox wish granted by manager Philippe Clement",
        "content": "Leon Balogun has extended his stay with Rangers by signing a new one-year contract extension, according to reports. The veteran defender is said to have convinced boss Philippe Clement to offer him fresh terms following a string of impressive displays at the heart of the Light Blues backline during the second half of the season. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. The 35-year-old returned to Ibrox last summer for a second spell after spending 12 months at EFL Championship side QPR. Balogun spoke about his desire to extend his Gers career after Saturday’s Scottish Cup final defeat to Celtic and it appears his wish has been granted. The Nigerian international was at risk of joining a host of other out-of-contract stars heading for the exit door this summer as Clement kickstarts his end of season squad overhaul. However, the Scottish Sun report that Balogun’s performances have impressed his manager and has subsequently penned a deal that will see him continue with the club next season. Speaking earlier this month, Clement dropped a big hint that Balogun could be handed a new deal. He stated: “Leon is somebody who showed every day the right mentality, the right passion for the club. So that can be something that is on the table at the end of the season also. But it is then that we can make a really good evaluation about everything and everybody.

To see how everybody trains, plays, behaves, works, shows resilience in the next couple of weeks because you want to be successful with this club so we need the right players in the building.” Balogun will now hope to be included in Rangers’ European roster next term, having been omitted from the group by previous boss Michael Beale at the start of the campaign. Clement is attempting to strengthen his central defensive options ahead of the transfer window opening next month, with Levski Sofia’s Jose Cordoba top of the Belgian’s summer wishlist . They currently have John Souttar, Connor Goldson as regular starters on the books along with fringe men Ben Davies and Leon King, but it's expected at least one of them will depart.",

        "content": "Eat bananas before downing a few beers. Afterwards, drink water with electrolyte powder before bed and Alka-Seltzer the next morning. Take painkillers. Sweat it out in a sauna. Put your head under the pillow and tell yourself “I’m never drinking again”. When it comes to hangover preventions and cures, there are many such alchemy-like notions doing the rounds. They are all a bit hit-and-miss, however, prompting researchers at one of Europe’s leading universities to come up with a “hydrogel” they say “could reduce the harmful and intoxicating effects of alcohol”. Developed at ETH Zurich and tested on mice, the protein-based gel intercepts booze in the body and converts it into “harmless acetic acid”. Not only does the gel promise to stop alcohol from getting into the bloodstream, it “shifts the breakdown of alcohol from the liver to the digestive tract”, according to Raffaele Mezzenga, a professor at the Laboratory of Food & Soft Materials at ETH Zurich. “In contrast to when alcohol is metabolised in the liver, no harmful acetaldehyde is produced as an intermediate product,” he explained. The gel led to a 50 per cent blood alcohol reductions in mice, results that have left the team “confident” it will work in humans, though they concede more tests will be needed.",

        "content": "Elite status brings many excellent benefits when traveling. This can include better treatment and handling at the airport, lounge access, additional luggage and better seats onboard, complimentary upgrades, and faster points or miles earning. Benefits are offered with the airline you hold status with – and across all alliance members where appropriate. Traveling with an airline outside the alliance can be a shock. Suddenly, you are back to the start with no benefits. Airlines know this and often offer to match your status with another airline/alliance. Alaska Airlines currently offers such a status match for elite members with several other airlines. Based on your existing status, you receive Mileage Plan status for 90 days – and can have this extended if you fly enough. Alaska Airlines currently runs a status match challenge. This allows the traveler to receive a complimentary matched status with Mileage Plan for 90 days (based on the level with another program). If a certain amount of flight activity is achieved within these 90 days, the status is then extended (as with standard earned status). You can be matched to three of the four elite levels, including MVP, MVP Gold, and MVP Gold 75K. However, you cannot be matched to the highest MVP Gold 100K level - this has to be earned in the normal way. Airlines will rarely make a status match open to everyone. Instead, they choose specific airlines and loyalty programs based on their target market. Alaska Airlines offers a match for elite members with most of the main US-based airline loyalty programs, as well as some other regional ones. Programs matched include: Love learning about points and miles? Read more of our . To apply for a status match, you simply complete the form on the Mileage Plan website. You need to include the details of the program where you hold status and attach a screenshot of proof of status and flight activity for the previous year. Some important terms of the status match include: The level you receive with a status match is fixed and based on your elite level with another airline. Of course, if you hold multiple elite statuses, it is worth choosing the higher level to match. Matches are made according to the table below: Loyalty Program Match to MVP level Match to MVP Gold level Match to MVP Gold 75K level Aeromexico Club Premier Gold Platinum Titanio Air Canada Aeroplan Altitude 25K, Altitude 35K Altitude 50K Altitude 75K, Altitude 100K American AAdvantage AAdvantage Gold AAdvantage Platinum AAdvantage Platinum, AAdvantage Platinum Pro, Concierge Key Delta SkyMiles Silver Medallion Gold Medallion Platinum Medallion, Diamond Medallion Frontier Miles 20K 50K 100K Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles Pualani Gold Pualani Platinum - JetBlue TrueBlue TrueBlue Mosaic - - Southwest Rapid Rewards A-List A-List Preferred A-List Preferred with Companion Pass United MileagePlus Premier Silver Premier Gold Premier 1K and Global Services The matched status is valid for 90 days. During this period, you will receive all the benefits of the matched level when traveling with Alaska Airlines. The status will also reflect with world, giving appropriate alliance-wide benefits if traveling with other airlines. To keep the status beyond 90 days requires meeting a certain level of flying with Alaska Airlines. This is separate from the standard elite miles earning – this is purely flown miles on Alaska Airlines flights - in any cabin. Clearly, you should take up the challenge when you know you have enough flying planned. If extended, the duration of the status depends on when the challenge was started. It is much more beneficial to start a challenge in the second half of the year to receive up to 18 months of status. The Alaska Airlines status challenge is a good way to get status in the quickly. Clearly, it does not work for everyone, and there are several other methods to consider: The Alaska Airlines status challenge is not the only one on offer. Such offers can change regularly. American Airlines AAdvantage currently has a status match open to elite members with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. This works in a similar way, with status awarded for four months and extensions based on Loyalty Points earned over that period. also currently offers a challenge, open to members of a wide variety of non- world airlines across the US, Europe and the Middle East. This works differently, with a fee to apply for the match (between $150 and $1500) and then minimal flying requirements with Royal Air Maroc. world member Qatar Airways , issued by Visa in partnership with Cardless. These offer various benefits, including elite status. While the requirements for elite status can at first seem daunting, if you have several flights planned, especially in premium cabins, it might not be that difficult. There are ways to expedite this. For example, awards Tier Points by sector – so taking connecting flights with a partner airline can double earnings. The same program also has a very lucrative promotion currently, which .

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( ) — Republicans moved their long-awaited new farm bill through the U.S. House Agriculture Committee this week, despite opposition from most Democrats that could stall further advancement of the bill. The massive $1.5 trillion legislation would set policy and funding levels for key food, agriculture and conservation programs for the next five years. After a marathon markup Thursday, the GOP-authored bill cleared the committee after midnight Friday, 33-21, with four Democratic votes. The committee’s bill would increase farm “safety net” payments for some commodity crops, expand eligibility for disaster assistance and increase funding for specialty crops, organic farmers and dairy farmers. It is expected to cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years. A title-by-title summary of the can be found . Democrats Don Davis of North Carolina, Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Yadira Caraveo of Colorado and Eric Sorenson of Illinois joined all committee Republicans to vote to advance the bill. After hours of heated debate and criticism from Democrats, support from the four lawmakers across the aisle seemed to surprise House Agriculture Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican who was the bill’s primary sponsor. His microphone picked up his aside as the vote concluded: “That was bipartisan. I did not see that one coming.” But the tepid Democratic support is likely not enough to see this version of the bill through to final passage in the House. A handful of Republicans typically oppose farm bills over fiscal concerns. And even Democrats who voted for the bill in the House committee said it needs major changes before it could make it into law. The measure does not have support of Democrats in the Senate or the White House. “Everyone knows that this bill would never become law. The Senate won’t accept it, and the administration won’t accept it,” Rep. David Scott of Georgia, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said at the markup. “And while this bill is a giant misstep, it nevertheless begins our journey toward passing a farm bill.” As the House committee debated the bill, Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow, the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in an interview Thursday that the House proposal has no chance in the Senate. “It tears up the farm and food coalition and does not have the votes to pass on the House floor. And certainly not in the Senate,” Stabenow told States Newsroom. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack that the farm bill draft would damage the coalition that traditionally has united behind farm bills and “raises the real possibility of being unable to get a farm bill through the process.” The committee vote – which came eight months after the previous farm bill expired – was the first step in what is expected to continue to be a protracted dispute over food and farm policy. Many farm commodity groups have come out in support of the bill, but it faces opposition from hunger advocacy groups as well as fiscal conservatives. Heritage Foundation, National Taxpayers Union and Taxpayers for Common Sense, along with Environmental Working Group, united this week to oppose the legislation, which they characterized as a government giveaway to favored special interests. The groups, which span the ideological spectrum, contend the proposed legislation would spend tens of billions of dollars in subsidies that would overwhelmingly go to a relatively small number of farmers who grow certain commodity crops. Historically, farm bills have brought together lawmakers across party lines, uniting on regional interests. The massive bill stitches together support for agriculture producers, energy and conservation programs on farmland and food and nutrition programs for families in need. But committee members are deeply divided over limits on nutrition and climate programs that are the funding mechanisms for the Republican bill. “This, on the policy side, is a very good bill,” Rep. Angie Craig, a Minnesota Democrat, said. “But on the payment side, how do you get to your math?” The for Democrats is a funding calculation that would place limits on the formula that calculates benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, the food aid program formerly referred to as food stamps. “One of the reasons it is so hard to negotiate the little items on this bill is because the big items and the funding mechanism are so fundamentally flawed,” Maine Democrat Chellie Pingree said. The bill would limit future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the formula that calculates benefits for SNAP. This would result in a nearly $30 billion reduction in spending over ten years, based on the estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, lawmakers say. “If we want a farm bill that is able to pass into law with the bipartisan levels that it requires to pass beyond this committee, it is necessary that we go back to the negotiating table and remove this provision,” Caraveo said. Caraveo, who faces a tough re-election in a toss-up district, ultimately voted in favor of the bill. Connecticut Democrat Jahana Hayes offered an amendment that would have struck the changes to the program. But after more than two hours of impassioned debate on the issue Thursday night, the amendment failed on a party-line vote, 25-29. The farm bill has to remain budget neutral, so lawmakers must fit their proposals into a baseline projection of how much the government would spend over the next 10 years if the current farm bill was extended. The House Republican bill would offset increases in payments for farmers by placing limits on SNAP and a discretionary account at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The committee-passed bill would put limits on USDA’s discretionary Commodity Credit Corporation account and would remove climate-smart policy requirements for about $13 billion in conservation projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. “Farmers agree that this is good money that has come to all of our states, and is critically important,” Pingree said. “So taking away this authority from one agriculture secretary maybe because you don’t like one program is completely misguided. It’s not thinking into the future.” On the Senate side, Stabenow released an outline of her own for the farm bill in early May but said she is waiting for language from Republicans before they can move forward. Among other things, Stabenow’s bill would boost eligibility for nutrition programs for low-income people like SNAP. Stabenow made public a summary of the bill, but not legislative text. Arkansas Republican John Boozman, the Senate Agriculture Committee’s top Republican, said Thursday he supports the direction on the farm bill from the House Agriculture Committee but was not optimistic about swift movement in his chamber. “We’ve got a lot of headwinds,” Boozman said in an interview with States Newsroom on Thursday. Boozman said he plans to release language in the coming weeks but indicated lawmakers might be headed toward another extension if they cannot make progress swiftly. “When I visit with the farm groups, I think their attitude is that rather than just doing something, if it’s not meaningful, we’re better off waiting,” Boozman told States Newsroom. “This is a five-year commitment. And, again, if we’re not going to do meaningful changes, to improve the safety of the farmers, it’s probably not worth doing.” The farm bill is generally considered “must-pass” legislation. Lawmakers must rewrite the sweeping legislation every five years to set mandatory funding levels and policy. The current farm bill expired at the end of September 2023 but most programs have continued through extensions. The current extension lasts until the end of September, but it is not clear if lawmakers will make that deadline – especially as attention turns to election campaigns over the summer and fall. The farm bill votes could be fuel in upcoming elections. As the House committee debated the measure Thursday, the GOP candidate in the Michigan U.S. Senate race to replace Stabenow criticized Democratic candidate and committee member Elissa Slotkin for her stance on the bill. Republican Mike Rogers took to X (formerly Twitter) to say Slotkin had not focused enough on the bill. While the House committee engaged in 13 hours of debate on the farm bill markup, Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that there would need to be more negotiations on the bill before it could become law. Rep. Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican and longtime committee member who chaired the panel from 2011 to 2015, characterized the committee vote as “the first step of a long journey.” “Now, ultimately, ultimately, we must work with each other to advance a comprehensive committee product,” Lucas said. “As we begin this process, I want to remind all my colleagues, the real struggle is not here in the Ag Committee, but on the floor of the United States House and in the conference committee. We will sort out our differences with the United States Senate.” SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Mayor Lina Cabrera said the place attracts people to savor local delicacies and appreciate the grand view of the vast fish ponds of the town. Cabrera told Sun.Star Pampanga that she opened the new facility this year to provide a venue for locals to sell their food products. The food park, which opened early this May to little fanfare, has been attracting locals and even people from neighboring towns, especially during the late afternoon. The food park, which carries the slogan “Manyaman Keni”, features vendors selling local delicacies, cooked meals, grilled food, and ready-to-eat food. A couple of concrete tables provide customers a place to eat and view the town’s vast pond area. The area is a favorite stopover of local bikers and joggers. “We wanted to have a place for food vendors to sell their products where there are people who can readily patronize them,\" Cabrera said.",

        "content": "Europe’s rivers, lakes and groundwater are riddled with “alarming” levels of a persistent man-made ‘forever chemical’ linked to synthetic pesticides, a coalition of non-governmental organisations said on Monday. The European Pesticide Action Network (PAN Europe) and its members analysed more than two dozen surface and groundwater samples from 10 European Union countries and found PFAS long-life substances in all. ALSO READ: Heads must roll over dirty water They said the abundance of one chemical in particular, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), represented “the largest known area-wide contamination by a man-made chemical” that well exceeded limits proposed by the 27-nation EU. “The extent of the contamination is alarming and calls for decisive action,” PAN Europe said in a new report detailing its findings. Widely used in everyday items like cosmetics, non-stick pans and fire extinguishers, PFAS are highly durable products that can take centuries to break down. They have been detected in water, air, fish and soil in the remotest corners of the globe, and concern over their possible impact on human health has been growing. Degrading PFAS used in pesticides are a major source of TFA. They are also released into the atmosphere from certain cooling systems and eventually enter the water cycle through rain. TFA is the “perfect” groundwater contaminant because it is highly soluble in water, extremely mobile and evades soil and other natural filters that remove pollutants, the report said. “They can enter the groundwater almost unhindered and remain there for centuries,” it said. ALSO READ: Mpumalanga municipality fined R200m for polluting rivers The samples, tested by the Water Technology Centre in Karlsruhe, Germany, found TFA in all water samples, with concentrations ranging from 370 nanograms per litre to 3,300 ng/L. Some 79 percent of samples had TFA levels above the proposed EU Drinking Water Directive limit of 500 ng/l for total PFAS, the report said. A decision to class TFA as ‘non-relevant’ under EU pesticide regulations was “regrettable” considering its “toxicological profile still leaves many questions unanswered”, it added. It said a recent study on rabbits and TFA exposure found birth defects in offspring, raising serious concerns about this chemical. PAN Europe called for urgent interventions to address this “political failure”, starting with a “rapid ban” on PFAS pesticides and a rethink on the threat posed by individual chemicals like TFA. © Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "DAME Darcey Bussell considering a life without dance is the only time she’s lost for words. While the 55-year-old is one of the most successful dancers of her generation, if not all time, she credits dance with not only giving her a career, but saving her life. 6 Dame Darcey Bussell credits dance with not only giving her a career, but saving her life Credit: Paul Tonge 6 Dame Darcey says: 'Dance lets children be physical without being competitive or trying to get into a team' Credit: Paul Tonge 6 She adds: 'There’s no sense of ‘I’m not really good enough,’ which is lovely' Credit: PA:Press Association “I was very dyslexic,” she tells Sun Health. “So, I needed another way of expressing myself. I didn’t have the vocabulary or the confidence in the classroom, but I needed expression. “So, when I found dance, it was like, ‘Oh, my goodness, it’s OK to be just me, as I am. I have something that I can excel in’. “What if I hadn’t had that? Would I have ever been the confident person I am?” Elegant, beautiful and graceful, yet impish, quick-witted and laugh-out-loud funny, the mum of two sits comfortably in Elmhurst Ballet School waiting for the five primary schools she’s invited for a free dance fitness workshop. Creator of Diverse Dance Mix — DDMix for short — Darcey excitedly shifts in her seat, clearly passionate about the initiative. One that not only brings dance to exercise classes across the country, but takes it into schools too, specifically targeting state institutions that wouldn’t get the opportunity to experience dance otherwise. As excited primary-age children look wide-eyed coming into the dance studio and their teachers nudge each other at being in the presence of the former Strictly judge, Darcey’s warm smile and graceful poise instantly make everyone feel comfortable.

Darcey Bussell quits Strictly Come Dancing after seven years as a judge “Dance lets children be physical without being competitive or trying to get into a team. \"There’s no sense of ‘I’m not really good enough,’ which is lovely.” A full-time classical ballet coach at the Royal Ballet, Darcey gets to let her hair down with DDMix, teaching flavours of different styles including Greek, African, Irish, Bollywood, Charleston and Flamenco. Her passion is infectious, but with less than half of children in the UK meeting physical exercise guidelines of 60 minutes per week, there’s an incredibly serious side to DDMix. Darcey’s programme has been specifically designed for PE lessons so every child has the opportunity to gain the many benefits that movement to music brings. “Dance gives you that resilience to get up and keep trying,” she says. Dance lets children be physical without being competitive or trying to get into a team. There’s no sense of ‘I’m not really good enough,’ which is lovely Darcey Bussell “I got to go to a dance class every Saturday from age of five, but I didn’t do variety. “When I started dancing, I wasn’t enamoured with ballet at all and it took me a long time to fall in love with it. “What’s upsetting me is that young children are not getting the enjoyment from being active because there isn’t that fun variety available. But dance provides this all so easily.” More than 3.5million adults in England do dance classes every month. Studies show it reduces stress, raises levels of happy hormone serotonin, reduces the risk of dementia and boosts long-term memory and spatial recognition . Having featured on Strictly’s panel from 2012 to 2018, Darcey talks fondly about the relationships she has with former colleagues and contestants, including 2016 winner, TV presenter Ore Oduba. 6 Dame Darcey says: 'Dance gives you that resilience to get up and keep trying' Credit: Paul Tonge 6 Dame Darcey in a typical DDmix class Credit: Paul Tonge 6 She says: 'Right now, for me, there’s a lot more to do around the survival of the arts and culture, and realising its purpose' Credit: BBC She says: “Ore is one of our ambassadors at DDMix. \"He understands the value of dance having gone through this amazing journey that is Strictly. “Ore hadn’t danced before. I think his first ambition was to be a footballer. “Then he went into presenting sports and children’s TV as well. \"But now he’s on the stage, and is in the happiest place ever. “I keep in touch with a lot of the professionals. A lot of them are friends. Dance gives you that resilience to get up and keep trying Darcey Bussell “I’m asked a lot about who I’d like to see on the show, but it’s usually the most unusual ones that are great. \"Part of that is because you could never predict it. \"To commit to Strictly is one of the hardest decisions to make for any celebrity. “I think a lot of people think ‘Oh, that can’t take that much time.’ But of course, massive hours go into rehearsal.” With an incredible figure, energy and sense of humour, despite being very busy, Darcey says there’s little left on her “to do” list other than bringing dance to children with her DDMix initiative. “I’ve been very lucky to have ticked all my ambitions. What’s upsetting me is that young children are not getting the enjoyment from being active because there isn’t that fun variety available. But dance provides this all so easily Darcey Bussell \"So now I’m just focused on what opportunities come about,” she says. “If they really are interesting, and I feel they have some value, and I learn something from it, then I’ll say yes. “Right now, for me, there’s a lot more to do around the survival of the arts and culture, and realising its purpose. \"I also focus a lot now on education, I realise there’s a lot of things missing.” For information about your nearest DDMix dance class, and to join the next live-streamed class with Darcey and schools across the UK on June 19, visit diversedancemix.com. 5 reasons to take steps WHETHER you are a wannabe Beyonce or just jive around the kitchen with your kids, dancing is a great way to get fit and improve your mental health. Here Darcey tells why showing your off moves is magic. STEALTH WORKOUT: Anyone can dance to get fit, unlike many other sports that are heavily focused on skill and competition. Darcey says: “The kids don’t even realise they’re exercising, and suddenly they’re out of breath. “The key message is to give kids a really positive attitude about being active, to show that it can be great fun. It uses the whole body and supports coordination, balance, physical strength and nerves, which are very important.” MIND MATTERS: THERE are five steps you can take to improve your mental health and wellbeing, according to the NHS: Connecting with others, exercising, learning new skills, being kind to others, and being in the present. These are all encompassed in a dance class, Darcey says. “It’s a no-brainer. Dancing has all five elements in one activity. If it came in pill form, it would be a pharmaceutical blockbuster.” HIGH FIVE: Even if you’ve got two left feet, you can get something out of dance. Strictly is the perfect example of people trying something new and also having the most extraordinary feeling. “It’s not just the costumes and the audience, it’s how they feel when they’ve accomplished something. “They say, ‘I never knew I could do that’.” CONFIDENCE BOOST: A Swedish study of 100 teenage girls, who had reported symptoms of anxiety , found that those who danced twice a week for eight months had improved health and self-esteem. The effects lasted more than a year after the classes. Speaking of DDmix dance classes, Darcey says: “Kids come in, they’re closed off, their eyes on the ground. “But when they leave the room after DDmix, they’ve got a totally different feeling about their bodies. “Suddenly their personalities shine.” Read more on the Scottish Sun GO FISHING Inside Scots music legend's cottage with studio as it hits the market for £850k ISLE SAY Tiny Scots isle where only 15 people live offering rare job with accommodation BRAIN GAME: STUDIES have shown dance can boost brain health and prevent brain shrinkage in older people, potentially stopping dementia and Parkinson’s.

        "content": "NZTA Waka Kotahi is proposing a 78 per cent cut to funding for median barriers on the Wellsford to Whangārei stretch of State Highway 1, due to changes in government priorities. The Northland Regional Council (NRC) says NZTA proposes cutting combined funding earmarked for the installation of median barriers along two sections of SH1 from $45 million to $10 million in the 2024-2027 period. As a result of the proposal, NRC has reopened a consultation process on its draft Regional Land Transport Programme (RLTP). Public consultation on the RLTP had closed on March 15, but NRC member Joe Carr says new public consultation is legally required in the event that “significant changes” (amounting to at least $7 million per project) are made to financial figures after consultation has closed. As that had happened in this case, a new public consultation is required – on this specific issue only. It will run until May 29. Carr, who chairs the Northland Regional Transport Committee, says NZTA informed council that it had amended some of the safety proposals in the draft document, as a result of “changes in government priorities and funding”. The two affected SH1 sections are in the “southern tranche” of the motorway, which runs from Wellsford to the southern side of the Brynderwyn Hills, and in the “central tranche”, a 17 km stretch from Port Marsden Highway to the northern end of the Brynderwyns. According to NZTA, flexible median barriers can reduce deaths and serious injuries by up to 65 percent. They prevent head-on collisions, which is how most people are killed or seriously injured on NZ roads. Carr says NZTA advised council that the redirected funding will go towards other State Highway safety initiatives, including implementing lower cost safety retrofits in high-risk locations. It will also go towards improvements such as accelerating four-laning of the motorway from Wellsford to Whangārei, as part of the Roads of National Significance (RoNS) initiative. “We are seeking submissions from Northlanders to inform us whether they agree or disagree with these proposals and to provide us with their comments.” An NZTA spokesperson says the agency cannot comment specifically on future planning and funding for individual projects until the Government Policy Statement on Land Transport (GPS) is finalised in the coming months. The GPS includes expectations for NZTA to deliver safety improvements via the RoNS programme, enhanced maintenance and other priority safety projects that focus on high risk locations. NZTA included a summary of its RoNS position, including potential funding options and proposed delivery timeframes, in its State Highway Investment Proposal, released on April 12. Once the GPS is finalised, NZTA will provide further advice on how it intends to deliver against the government’s expectations and priorities, in the lead up to adopting the 2024-27 National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), which will confirm the project priority and funding. NZTA expects the NLTP to be adopted in late August. Submissions on the Northland RLTP can be made to: More info:",

        "content": "Shepard and the Bears fell to the Rochester Americans 4-1 Wednesday night. The defending Calder Cup champion Hershey Bears booked their second straight trip to the AHL’s Eastern Conference Finals. Hershey, which swept the Hartford Wolf Pack in a best-of-five Atlantic Division Finals, will host Game 1 of the best-of-seven conference championship series against the Cleveland Monsters scheduled for 7 p.m. Thursday at the Giant Center. The Bears won all four of their regular-season matchups with the Monsters by a combined score of 22-5. Hershey goaltenders Hunter Shepard and Clay Stevenson each recorded a shutout. Cleveland swept the Syracuse Crunch 3-0 in the North Division Finals. Fox 43 announced plans to air all of the series' games on Antenna TV (Fox 43.2). Starting pitchers Andrew Alvarez and Brad Lord both tossed seven-inning shutouts Sunday to help the Harrisburg Senators sweep a doubleheader against the Akron Rubberducks and win the six-game regular-season series at FNB Field four games to two. The Senators (27-18), who have won five consecutive series, finished the weekend tied with Akron for first place in the Eastern League. They’re scheduled to face off again July 30-Aug. 4 in Harrisburg. Lord improved his record to 5-1 and lowered his earned-run average to 1.81 with his nine-strikeout performance in a 2-0 victory. Alvarez improved to 3-2 with a 3.00 ERA. He struck out five. The Senators returned to the road for a six-game series with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies scheduled to begin Monday. Danny Dietrich started on the pole and led all 25 laps to win the 410 sprint cars John Trone Tribute Race at Williams Grove Speedway, the track’s second Diamond Series race of the season. The victory, Dietrich’s 30th at Williams Grove, earned him $10,039. Spencer Bayston finished second while Lucas Wolfe, Cory Eliason and Chase Dietz rounded out the top five. Logan Spahr won Friday’s 305 sprints feature, followed by Josh Beamer, Christian Rumsey and Mike Melair. Friday’s racing program also includes a Diamond series race for the 410 sprints with an $8,000 prize and a $300 award for the fastest qualifier.

        "content": "STANDING in the doorway of her home, mum-of-four Sarah Smith thought of desperate excuses to turn away the man who stood on her step. Once a family friend who had lent her and husband Anthony cash for Christmas, he had turned into a sex-crazed loan shark who offered her an “easy” way out of debt. 6 Evil loan sharks are forcing debtors into sex Credit: Shutterstock 6 Thugs are intimidating victims with violence Credit: Shutterstock “Put on some sexy underwear and we can come to an arrangement,” he told her. Sarah, who point-blank refused, is among thousands of women across the country being targeted by twisted, heartless lenders pushing some victims to the brink of suicide. Frightened borrowers have shared shocking stories of exploitation, violence and blackmail. One shark even offered to send a gang of men to a woman’s home for sex “while the kids are at school”. Our exclusive statistics reveal that almost one in ten female borrowers have been asked to clear debt through sex. It is the first time such figures have been recorded by England’s Illegal Money Lending Team, a group of specialist investigators and officers. Sarah and Anthony, 39, who live in the West Midlands, borrowed around £10,000 over 15 years but were unable to make payments when Covid hit and they suffered health issues. Anthony, who was paying 70 per cent interest on the loan, said: “It was then the shark began putting pressure on me and started being intimidating, coming out with comments to my wife in front of our 14-year-old daughter.

Almost half of those targeted are in work but have been hit hard by rising food and energy bills. Care worker Paula, 28, of Leeds, told how a shark pestered her for sex before suggesting she become a prostitute to pay off her debt. She was introduced to the lender through a friend at work and borrowed £100. Paula faced what is known as “double bubble” interest, where the amount owing doubles each week. It was tripled the week after if she failed to pay. She soon owed £3,000. She said: “The lender contacted my parents telling them I owe money. 6 Loan shark Richard Dawson puts a victim in a boot on CCTV Credit: SWNS “He came to my workplace to intimidate me. I closed my Facebook account for fear of what he might post on there. I felt trapped. “He pestered me for sex and I was told to become a prostitute to pay off what I owed. “I could never do that, but at one point it did seem like it might be the only way out. “It was more the pestering for sex that felt so overwhelming.” Paula’s nightmare only came to an end when she was contacted by the Illegal Money Lending Team, which was already investigating the man. Jane, a mum of three who borrowed from someone she knew at work, was left petrified when she changed her phone number and the lender threatened to kill her. ﻿The loan shark contacted my family to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. I went to a bridge and was going to jump off. Only the thought of my kids stopped me Jane of South London The 52-year-old, of South London, revealed: “They contacted family members to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. “I went to a bridge and was going to jump off because of the threats. Only the thought of my children stopped me from doing it.” Delivery driver Sunny, 26, from Devon, found an illegal lender online after becoming so financially strapped he went without food to make sure his kids ate. He said: “On paper my income looks great, but in reality we were constantly playing catch-up paying her off.” All these victims, who told their stories to the IMLT, were too frightened to reveal their real identities to The Sun for fear of retribution. An estimated one million borrowers owe money to loan sharks, according to a report published by the Centre for Social Justice. This figure has more than tripled since 2010. New statistics from the IMLT reveal that 31 per cent of borrowers have contemplated or attempted suicide, while three in ten have been threatened or assaulted by lenders. IMLT expert Catherine Wohlers said: “Nine per cent of female borrowers we helped last year have been told they can clear their debt with sexual favours. “Some of the suggestions are quite explicit and upfront, but others are less so, such as, ‘It would be nice if you could be wearing something nice when I come round’. “One woman was told, ‘If I send some men around when the kids are at school that could sort your debt’.” Catherine says almost half of those taking loans from sharks are low earners or families in financial crisis. She added: “We’ve seen a change in the reasons why people use them. “Many are now borrowing for food and fuel, when it would historically be for one-off expenses like a new car tyre, school uniforms or for Christmas. It’s a myth that everyone who borrows is on benefits. More than 40 per cent are working, some in low-paid jobs, or maybe their circumstances have changed due to a relationship breakdown, bereavement or business collapse. ‘It angers me I have been made to feel like a fool’ “The youngest borrower we helped last year was 19 and the oldest 91. The highest amount loaned was £99,000 and the person concerned paid back £450,000 over 25 years. “Half of borrowers went without food, fuel or making priority payments in order to pay their loan.” The figures also show eight per cent found loan sharks on social media, double the amount in 2022. The revelations come after one of Britain’s most violent loan sharks was this month jailed for seven years for kidnap, GBH and illegal money lending. Richard Dawson, 35, from Barnsley , bundled his victim into the boot of his car and drove him to a cashpoint to make payments. Sheffield Crown Court heard how vicious, tattooed Dawson collected £52,000 from 88 “customers”. He once broke the jaw of a man who could not pay up. His barrister Sean Fritchley said Dawson’s actions sounded “like something from The Sopranos” but that his client was “ashamed”. Judges have also jailed a number of pensioner loan sharks — including the country’s oldest at 83. Two Filipino hospital workers preyed on immigrant colleagues, lending them £4.2million over a 16-year period. Luz Guerra Villar, 67, and Leticia Manipol, 71, were given suspended jail sentences in 2021 after admitting illegal lending and money laundering. They were last month ordered to pay back £1.2million by a court in South London. 6 Vicious Richard got seven years in jail for his crimes Credit: MEN Media 6 Gangster great granny Tabitha Richardson lent neighbours and 'friends' £120,000 over 20 years Credit: WNS It is the largest amount confiscated in 14 years. Gangster great-granny Tabitha Richardson lent neighbours and “friends” £120,000 over 20 years. The 83-year-old from Newport, South Wales, was described as “threatening and menacing” while charging 40 per cent interest on six-month loans. She was handed a two-year suspended sentence last August after admitting her illegal business. Last month she was ordered to pay back £173,000. Tony Quigley, head of the IMLT, said: “Illegal lenders often live a life of luxury while people who have borrowed from them struggle. “It’s only right that these criminals are not only prosecuted but are at last made to pay back at least some of their ill-gotten gains.” Sarah and husband Anthony are now picking up their lives. He said: “It still angers me because I have been made to feel like a fool. “To find out afterwards there were so many other people he was making money off makes me so angry.

        "description": "Mr. Li said China wants to cooperate with South Korea and Japan on economic issues, especially on supply chains and the restart of talks on a three-way free trade deal",
        "content": "China’s Premier agreed on Monday to revive three-way cooperation with South Korea and Japan in the face of shared challenges, but issued a veiled rebuke against the two countries’ expanding security cooperation with the United States. Chinese Premier Li Qiang met South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul in what was their countries’ first such trilateral meeting in more than four years. Many experts say just restarting the countries’ highest-level annual meeting and agreeing on the need to improve ties is a positive sign for cooperation among the three Northeast Asian neighbours, as they all face economic uncertainties caused by wars and instability around the world. But how drastically their cooperation will be promoted is unknown as the three countries have a range of long-running complex issues. In a joint news conference after the meeting, Mr. Li said China wants to cooperate with South Korea and Japan on economic issues, especially on supply chains and the restart of talks on a three-way free trade deal. Mr. Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, establish safe supply chain networks and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues. Mr. Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral leaders’ meeting. Despite the seemingly amicable mood of the meeting, however, Mr. Li at one point expressed Chinese uneasiness about Japan and South Korea’s moves to beef up their security partnership with the U.S., which Beijing views as an attempt to form a bloc to contain China. “We need to have honest dialogues to better enhance trust and resolve doubts. We must uphold the spirit of strategic autonomy and maintain our bilateral relations,” Mr. Li said in comments at the start of the meeting with Mr. Yoon and Mr. Kishida. “We need to promote multipolarity in the world and oppose the formation of blocs or camps.” China is wary of Japan’s plan to deploy 400 U.S. Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and allow repair and maintenance of U.S. warships in Japan to support their operations in the western Pacific. The expansion of military drills among South Korea, the U.S. and Japan have also drawn protests from China. The trilateral meeting was also briefly overshadowed by North Korea’s abrupt notification to Japan of its plan to launch a satellite by early next week, an apparent bid to place its second spy satellite into orbit. The UN bans any satellite launches by North Korea, viewing them as disguised tests of the country’s long-range missile technology. North Korea has said it needs spy satellites to better monitor South Korea and the U.S. and enhance the precision-attack capabilities of its missiles. Mr. Yoon called for stern international action if North Korea goes ahead with the launch. Mr. Kishida urged North Korea to withdraw its satellite launch plan. But Mr. Li did not mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. South Korea, Japan and the U.S. have long urged China — North Korea’s major ally and economic pipeline — to use its leverage to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions. But China is suspected of avoiding fully implementing UN sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to its impoverished, sociality neighbour to stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula. In a bilateral meeting with Mr. Li on Sunday, Mr. Yoon asked China to contribute to promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula, while speaking about North Korea’s nuclear program and its deepening military ties with Russia. After meeting with Mr. Li on Sunday, Mr. Kishida also told reporters that he expressed serious concerns about the situations in the South China Sea, Hong Kong and China’s northwestern Xinjiang region. He said Japan was closely monitoring developments on self-governed Taiwan as well. Mr. Kishida referred to China’s military assertiveness in the South China Sea, clampdowns on pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong and human rights abuses against minorities in Xinjiang. Last week, China also launched a large military exercise around Taiwan to show its anger over the inauguration of the island’s new president who refuses to accept its insistence that Taiwan is part of China. On Monday, Mr. Li still did not respond directly to the outside accusations against the Chinese actions in the South China Sea or surrounding Taiwan. “China, Japan and South Korea should appropriately handle sensitive issues and points of difference, and take care of each other’s core interests and major concerns,” Li said. “And truly construct a real multilateralism.” The three Asian nations together represent about 25% of global gross domestic product, and they are closely linked to one another economically and culturally. But their relations have suffered on-again, off-again setbacks owing to issues stemming from Japan’s wartime aggression. China’s ambitions of greater global influence and a U.S. push to bolster its Asian alliances have also threatened to hurt ties among the three Asian countries. The China-South Korea-Japan trilateral meeting was supposed to happen annually following their first meeting in 2008. But the sessions stalled since the last one in December 2019 in Chengdu, China because of the COVID-19 pandemic and often-complicated ties among the three countries. Experts say the three countries all want better relations. China is the biggest trading partner for both South Korea and Japan. Analysts say China likely thinks any further strengthening of the South Korea-Japan-U.S. security ties would not serve its national interests. “Washington can trust its allies in their diplomatic efforts with Beijing,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. “The China-Japan-South Korea trilateral summit is more about reducing frictions than reshaping geopolitics.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit South Korea / China / Japan / USA",

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.”",

A pet charity says words with “s” in them sound like aggressive hissing. 1 Cat owners are being told to stop saying 'Here, puss' to moggies Credit: Getty PDSA vet nurse Gemma Renwick added: “ Cats pick up on certain sounds and tend to prefer fewer ‘s’ sounds. The ‘s’ noise is similar to a cat hissing, which is almost like swearing at them every time you want their attention. “Consider speaking their language and meowing at them. “Unlike hissing, adult cats don’t really meow at one another, but do use meows to communicate with us humans.” Gemma warned feline fans of several moggie mistakes ahead of next Tuesday’s annual #HugYourCatDay — including cuddles. She said: “Hugging, and other approaches we may consider signs of affection, can actually be detrimental. “If a cat runs away as you come towards them or they dash off as soon as you let go, it’s a good sign they don’t want to be touched or have their personal space invaded. “Always let your cat come to you and you’ll reap the rewards of consensual kitty cuddles.” Gemma added that making eye contact was “quite threatening” and advised we instead copy cats’ “slow blink”.

        "description": "To groom staff, BE companies are including training initiatives for leadership, communication and offering coaching programmes.",
        "content": "Eleven years into his engineering career, Mr Wong Hau Fei attended a course that he never expected would make an important impact on his work. As a technical manager with Straits Construction , the 36-year-old works on tender submissions for large-scale projects that include highly technical details on construction sequence, resources planning, value engineering and cost estimations. The home-grown construction player has sent him on many courses to advance his knowledge and skills, including a specialist diploma in underground construction. But it was a “soft skills” training in managing EQ (emotional quotient) and communications he attended in 2023 that he found to be one of the most impactful for his work. “I never thought that this kind of skill would be so important, to be able to communicate in different ways to achieve different results,” says Mr Wong. His firm is one of the companies in the built environment (BE) sector to recognise early on the importance of nurturing employees beyond the traditional sense. Instead of only sending staff for industry-specific courses, many BE companies, which include developers, builders, design consultants as well as facilities management firms, train employees with a more holistic approach. The staff are stretched professionally and exposed to areas such as strategic thinking, project management and communications. With the projected annual construction demand expected to be between $31 billion and $38 billion in the next three years, a substantial talent pool of BE professionals will be needed. That is why firms are transforming to become good employers to attract, retain and develop talents. Straits Construction’s Mr Wong has seen an improvement in how he gets the job done after applying what he had learned at the communication course. “For example, communicating with management has become more efficient and effective, and also during meetings with internal teams and external clients,” he says. The opportunity to continuously learn new skills and boost his professional development assured him that re-joining Straits Construction in August 2021 was the right decision. “I left the firm to see what other companies were doing and to learn new things. Returning, I’ve realised that Straits Construction understands the value of soft skills, not only technical knowledge,” says Mr Wong. He admits he has personally benefitted from a series of courses, specially curated by the company to prepare managers in their management roles. With the company’s focus on professional development complemented by steady guidance from his superiors, he now assumes a more senior role at work. Currently, he is chairing a technical committee of 15 internal and external stakeholders for an executive condominium project in Tengah. For its efforts, Straits Construction is ranked among Singapore’s best employers in the 2024 ranking compiled by Statista in collaboration with The Straits Times . Other noteworthy BE firms on the ranking include engineering consultancy Mott MacDonald and construction conglomerate Chip Eng Seng . Likewise at Mott MacDonald, Ms Li Yihao is continuously developing not just her engineering expertise, but also her soft skills. With full support from her company, the 29-year-old structural engineer has chosen to pursue professional credentials even as she works on part of the North-South Corridor (NSC) road tunnel project. “I am currently preparing for the Practice of Professional Engineering exam (PPE) to be registered as a Professional Engineer (PE) with the Professional Engineers Board Singapore,” says Ms Li, who has already passed her Fundamentals of Engineering Examination. “At the same time, I have started the journey to become a chartered engineer with the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) this year.” Headquartered in the United Kingdom, the ICE is an independent professional association for civil engineers globally and its chartership offers training support and guidance within the profession. Ms Li is able to work towards the industry certifications while meeting her day-to-day deliverables with the help of initiatives such as a regional mentorship programme that focuses on professional charterships and career planning. She is also part of the company’s Inclusive Network for Women that facilitates one-on-one connections between regional senior leadership and female colleagues. Since February this year, she has been working with Ms Peng Yi, a principal design engineer and 12-year veteran at Mott MacDonald, towards the ICE chartership. Ms Peng, 35, observes that after five years with the firm, Ms Li has picked up many of the attributes that ICE will assess her on, including competencies in commercial and communication aspects of her work. “She has 40 per cent of the attributes and needs to work on the remaining 60 per cent in the next two years,” says Ms Peng. As a mentor, Ms Peng closely monitors Ms Li’s professional progress, identifies areas for improvement, offers guidance and support, and guides her towards achieving both her PE registration and the ICE chartership. “Over the coming years I’ll help increase Yihao’s sustainability awareness and expertise by deepening her understanding of the broader impact on a society,” says Ms Peng. This resonates with Ms Li who plays a part in designing the NSC as a more sustainable infrastructure. “I became a civil engineer when I realised how much positive impact the profession can bring to society. The NSC project, for example, will benefit not only our generation but will be there well into the very long future,” she says. Where Ms Li is actively designing more sustainable infrastructure, Mr Darius Tay started working with environmentally friendly materials as an undergraduate intern with Chip Eng Seng in 2021. “I had an internship opportunity in CES_Innovfab that specialises in 3D concrete printing technology. The experience provided me with invaluable insights into the construction industry and intricacies of project management,” says the 25-year-old. He excelled over the six-month internship period that Chip Eng Seng had no qualms about hiring him for a full-time role with the company after he graduated. On his part, Mr Tay was eager to work for a company that gave him valuable industry experience, as well as the support and space to explore his own professional goals. As an intern, Mr Tay was involved in the research and development (R&D) works in CES_Innovfab. He also helped develop and implement safety protocols and procedures for the newly established business unit to attain the bizSAFE level 3 certification. After graduation in early 2024, Mr Tay joined CES_Salcon, a subsidiary of Chip Eng Seng that specialises in water and wastewater treatment. It was no surprise that he was already familiar with the company’s processes and culture. “I’m now primarily focused on an offshore floating liquefied natural gas project that involves intricate planning, precise engineering and stringent quality control measures to meet the client’s specifications and industry standards,” says the project engineer. Like Mr Wong at Straits Construction, Mr Tay also discovered that while technical know-how can be learned on the job, the soft skills had to be picked up more actively. “As a fresh graduate in my very first project engineer role, I had to quickly pick up a lot of new skills on the job, especially soft skills such as communication, leadership and team management,” says Mr Tay. Luckily, he had started to build up these skills during his internship. “I am a reserved and quiet person by nature, but I was expected to engage our vendors from time to time during my internship. This opportunity has, in a way, built up my confidence and made me more outspoken,” says Mr Tay. During the internship, he could also turn to the guidance of a project manager and project engineer, who helped him navigate work complexities and challenges. That mentorship framework continues for Mr Tay as a new hire, who now looks to experienced colleagues in the company. “I’ve received much guidance and support from them, which was instrumental as I am in a field completely different from my material science and engineering degree,” says Mr Tay. He is grateful that he found Chip Eng Seng when he “followed his passion” for 3D printing – it led him to a company that he now knows will support and guide him on whichever path he chooses as his career advances. “I found Chip Eng Seng because I followed my interests and look where I am now.” The built environment sector, which has myriad job roles across different fields, has been pivotal in shaping Singapore into the modern city it is today. In response to rapid technological changes and evolving human needs, companies in this sector are also always innovating. Learn more about the fulfilling career opportunities.",

The OCP amendment would allow for an increase in density on the property, which is described in the report as “an under-developed site that is designated Commercial in the King George LAP (Local Area Plan) and is served by bus routes.” The applicant wants to build a four-storey, 80-room hotel with underground parking. The planning report notes the proposed structure’s 14-metre height is “an appropriate transition” between townhouses eyed for the west side of King George and four- and five-storey mixed-use buildings proposed for the intersection of King George and 156 Street.

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. 1 The British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos Credit: Getty One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.” Most read in The Sun BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate 'YIKES' Scotland Euros hero spotted at Old Firm Cup final with radical hair change Couple caught having sex in broad daylight outside library in Barcelona",

        "description": "Declan Rice has proven to be an outstanding signing for Arsenal following his club-record transfer last summer. When Mikel Arteta brought him to the club...The post ’They got Declan Rice’: Departing West Ham man backs Arsenal to sign £63m star appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "When Mikel Arteta brought him to the club from West Ham United, it was a signing much-needed and one fans were excited to see in their colours. There is no doubt that and probably their best player this season, but it wasn’t enough to win . are looking around and thinking ‘what next?’. They posted 89 points. Had the best defence in the Premier League (29 goals conceded) and took four points off Manchester City. But it wasn’t enough to dethrone the all-dominant Manchester City and now many are questioning what happens next. Naturally, the team look towards the summer transfer market and possibly looking to sign that much-needed striker. Kevin Nolan is adamant that the Gunners need to bring in that type of player after signing Rice last summer. The Englishman, who was part of David Moyes’ coaching staff at at the end of the season, threw forward the name of Newcastle United hitman, . Nolan feels a player like Isak could help Arsenal get the job done, in regards to becoming champions of England, as he told . Alexander Isak at Arsenal “Isak at Newcastle is certainly another one,” said Nolan. “Them two (Isak and Toney) have been named quite regularly with Arsenal and them sort of being interested. “Mikel Arteta has done a fantastic job. I am sure the next one is the important one. They got Dec (Rice) last year, they need another one this year and then I think they could get close to Man City.” Alexander Isak’s importance to Newcastle United The 24-year-old ended the Premier League campaign with 21 goals from 30 matches. This is despite Newcastle being one of the worst injury-hit teams this season. Isak only recorded two assists, but everyone knows he is capable of much more because he is one of the best ball-carriers in the Premier League. But given that Newcastle paid a club-record for his services, you have to question how much they would want if they were forced to part ways with him. You would have to say beyond £100 million. That puts Arsenal on the back foot because FFP probably wouldn’t allow them to go to those levels again.",

        "content": "Graduation indeed is one of the momentous points in a person’s life as it marks the sense of accomplishment and success that result from hard work and perseverance. It serves as a milestone that opens the door to many opportunities for a person to reach his life-long dreams and aspirations. Truly, it is also an occasion that may symbolize the beginning of an independent and rewarding life. During my pre-employment talks, I always try to motivate future graduates regarding the “reality” waiting for them the moment they step out of the university. I ask them to look at the person seated beside them, who may be their closest friend in college. But after graduation, this person whom they consider as their best friend will become his or her direct competitor as they both carry the same degree from the same university. So, to impel them into a reality check, I ask them this very thought-provoking question: “What do you have that other graduates like you don’t have?” And just as I anticipated their reactions, I could see a sense of sudden realization on their faces. After more than eight years of teaching at a state university, I feel happiness and pride whenever my students graduate. It’s as if I am their parent who saw them grow and mature as the years passed. I have asked myself a couple of times, am I that old to see these students graduate? And suddenly, I realized it had been four or five years ago when I first handled their English classes when they were still freshmen. However, it is unfortunate nowadays that these graduates do not end up where they are supposed to be. I have several former students whom I have seen working in supermarkets as cashiers and baggers, and I can’t explain how I feel whenever I see them. As graduates of a four-year course, they do not deserve to work in blue-collar jobs. At least, they should be office assistants in government agencies and private companies, call center agents, or even professionals in multinational companies here and abroad. Hence, the problem is not actually unemployment but rather it is underemployment that besets our country nowadays. Add to that the impact of the ASEAN integration on labor demands and market wherein based on a study, the projected growth in the country will be focused on low-skill employment. Secondly, there will also be fewer new jobs for women, possibly in sectors that are vulnerable and informal leading to greater inequalities. Another possible consequence of the ASEAN integration will also affect professionals as other Asian workers will be welcomed to work in our country. And with the increasing popularity and utilization of artificial intelligence in the academe and even in the workplace, the question is also on whether our acquired skills and knowledge in schools and universities are still relevant and will be needed in the future. Are we seeing the looming end to human talent?",

Rozee in doubt for mega Blues clash | 00:40 PORT ADELAIDE v CARLTON Thursday May 30, 7:30pm at Adelaide Oval Power’s Round 11 side B: K.Farrell, E.Ratugolea, B.Zerk-Thatcher HB: M.Bergman, A.Aliir, D.Houston C: T.Boak, O.Wines, W.Drew HF: D.Byrne-Jones, T.Marshall, M.Georgiades F: Z.Butters, J.Finlayson, W.Rioli FOLL: J.Sweet, J.Horne-Francis, C.Rozee - C I/C: J.Mead, J.McEntee, La.Jones, R.Burton, J.Burgoyne EMG: D.Visentini, T.Anastasopoulos, F.Evans Team Tips: The big question mark is over Connor Rozee (ankle), who’ll be a test for the Thursday night blockbuster against the Blues. The Power will need to find a replacement for Willie Rioli who suffered a calf injury early against North Melbourne. Francis Evans would be among the leading contenders to replace him after amassing 21 disposals and a goal in the SANFL, while untried forward Tom Anastasopoulos could also be given a go. Ruck Ivan Soldo played his first game back after knee surgery in the SANFL but expect him to play at least another week there to build some match fitness. Quinton Narkle and Trent McKenzie also returned from injury via the SANFL last week. Blues’ Round 11 side B: A.Saad, J.Weitering, L.Cowan HB: B.Kemp, M.McGovern, N.Newman C: O.Hollands, P.Cripps - C, B.Acres HF: Z.Williams, H.McKay, E.Hollands F: O.Fantasia, C.Curnow, M.Owies FOLL: T.De Koning, S.Walsh, M.Kennedy I/C: J.Boyd, G.Hewett, A.Cincotta, L.Fogarty, J.Carroll EMG: C.Durdin, Le.Young, J.Binns Team Tips: Livewire small forward Jesse Motlop played his first game of 2024 in the VFL on the weekend but struggled to make an impact with just five disposals and a goal. Jaxon Binns continues to push his case for a senior recall with 25 touches, which could put pressure on a player like Alex Cincotta (seven disposals). Jack Carroll and Orazio Fantasia also struggled to impact the contest against the Suns. AFL umps express sympathy for tacklers | 00:56 COLLINGWOOD v WESTERN BULLDOGS Friday May 31, 7:40pm at Marvel Stadium Pies’ Round 11 side B: C.Dean, D.Moore - C, B.Frampton HB: I.Quaynor, J.Noble, S.Pendlebury C: S.Sidebottom, B.McCreery, J.Daicos HF: B.Hill, N.Daicos, B.Mihocek F: E.Allan, P.Lipinski, H.Harrison FOLL: D.Cameron, J.Crisp, L.Schultz I/C: B.Maynard, J.Richards, L.Sullivan, W.Parker, M.Cox EMG: N.Kreuger, F.Macrae, A.Johnson Team Tips: The premiers are nowhere near peak condition right now, though they’re still not losing, which is pretty impressive. Collingwood will need to find replacements for Mason Cox (leg/concussion), Joe Richards (foot) and Brody Mihocek for their clash against the Bulldogs, plus Jordan De Goey is set to miss another month with an ab tendon tear. That puts the likes of Reef McInnes, Nathan Kreuger and Ash Johnson in the frame for senior selection. Collingwood’s VFL side didn’t have a match last week, but the Pies will be hoping to potentially get Jeremy Howe and Jack Bytel back from injury. Jamie Elliott (vascular) and Tom Mitchell (foot) are confusingly both 2-5 weeks away, while Will Hoskin-Elliott (hamstring) should be back in a fortnight. Depending on how they’re looking on the injury front, debutants Wil Parker and Ed Allan, along with defender Charlie Dean , could end up being unlucky at selection. Bulldogs’ Round 11 side B: L.Bramble, L.Jones, R.Sanders HB: T.Duryea, A.Keath, B.Dale C: B.Williams, A.Treloar, J.Harmes HF: L.Vandermeer, A.Naughton, J.Macrae F: S.Darcy, J.Ugle-Hagan, R.West FOLL: T.English, M.Bontempelli - C, E.Richards I/C: C.Daniel, J.Freijah, H.Gallagher, R.Garcia, A.Scott EMG: L.Cleary, R.Lobb, J. O’Donnell Team Tips: Luke Beveridge will be forced into at least three changes this week with Aaron Naughton (knee), Ed Richards (concussion) and Anthony Scott (concussion) all already ruled out. Expect Rory Lobb to be a straight replacement for Naughton, while Luke Cleary and James O’Donnell (illness) are both likely to be in the mix at selection as well. Oskar Baker (22 disposals) and Lachie McNeil (two goals) were strong at VFL level too. Coaches open up on ball holding drama | 03:25 HAWTHORN v ADELAIDE CROWS Saturday June 1, 1:45pm at the MCG Hawks’ Round 11 side B: J.Impey - C, S.Frost, C.Jiath HB: K.Amon, J.Sicily, M.D’Ambrosio C: C.Nash, J.Worpel, J.Weddle HF: W.Day, C.Mackenzie, L.Breust F: J.Ginnivan, B.Hardwick, M.Chol FOLL: L.Meek, J.Newcombe, D.Moore I/C: C.Macdonald, S.Mitchell, C.Dear, J.Gunston, J.Scrimshaw EMG: F. Maginness, E. Phillips, J. Ward Team Tips: The Hawks have been one of the most in-form sides in the competition over the last six weeks so expect Sam Mitchell to continue to back a winning formula. Chad Wingard has now played four matches at VFL level as he strives to make his senior return after an achilles injury in 2023. Nick Watson was managed last week and will be in the frame to return, which could see Luke Breust’ s or Seamus Mitchell’ s place in the 23 come under a bit of heat. Crows’ Round 11 side B: B.Smith, J.Butts, C.Jones HB: J.Borlase, M.Keane, M.Michalanney C: M.Hinge, J.Soligo, J.Dawson - C HF: L.Sholl, T.Walker, J.Rachele F: C.Burgess, D.Fogarty, L.Murphy FOLL: R.O’Brien, R.Laird, H.Schoenberg I/C: M.Crouch, B.Cook, S.Berry, L.Nankervis, B.Keays EMG: W. Hamill, N. McHenry, K. Strachan Team Tips: Hard to see Matthew Nicks making many changes at selection after a monster 99-point defeat over the Eagles. The untried Zac Taylor was solid in the SANFL with 23 disposals and nine clearances but it’s hard to see how he forces his way in. Nick Murray is nearing a return from a knee injury in other positive news, which would eventually put some pressure on a player like James Borlase . Crows run riot in thrashing of Eagles | 02:07 WEST COAST EAGLES v ST KILDA Saturday June 1, 4:35pm at Optus Stadium Eagles’ Round 11 side B: J.Rotham, T.Barrass, B.Hough HB: T.Cole, J.McGovern, L.Duggan - C C: J.Hunt, T.Kelly, R.Ginbey HF: D.Sheed, J.Waterman, J.Cripps F: L.Ryan, J.Darling, R.Maric FOLL: B.Williams, E.Yeo, H.Reid I/C: C.Chesser, A.Witherden, J.Jones, J.Williams, T.Dewar EMG: A. Gaff, C. Hall, H. Edwards Team Tips: You’d imagine Adam Simpson makes some changes after a brutal defeat to the Crows last week. Veteran Andrew Gaff (34 disposals) continues to bang down the door, while Zane Trew (36 disposals), Jai Culley (23 disposals) and Harry Edwards (24 disposals) were strong performers in the WAFL. Almost half of West Coast’s side had ten disposals or less against Adelaide. Off-season recruits Matt Flynn and Tyler Brockman are two others who will look to put their hands up for selection in the coming weeks. Saints’ Round 11 side B: J.Battle, D.Howard, C.Wilkie HB: J.Webster, L.Stocker, N.Wanganeen-Milera C: S.Ross, J.Sinclair, M.Wood HF: D.Wilson, B.Hill, L.Henry F: M.Owens, M.King, A.Caminiti FOLL: R.Marshall, J.Steele - C, M.Windhager I/C: J.Higgins, L.Collard, P.Dow, R.Bonner, C.Sharman EMG: Z. Jones, R. Byrnes, B. Paton Team Tips: While St Kilda might be struggling in the AFL, their VFL affiliate, Sandringham, pulled off a great win against Casey in the VFL. Spearhead Tim Membrey booted six goals while former Sandringham Dragons product Olli Hotton kicked five majors as he seeks an AFL debut. Brad Crouch (30 disposals), Zak Jones (25 disposals) and Hunter Clark (30 disposals) all found plenty of the footy in the VFL. Mattaes Phillipou responded to his second axing of 2024 with 20 disposals, while small forward Dan Butler kicked 1.3 from 16 touches. Cooper Sharman, Lance Collard, Liam Stocker and Anthony Caminiti are among the names who might be in the firing line for Ross Lyon at selection this week. 'Throw an extra $1 million at them' | 00:51 GEELONG v RICHMOND Saturday June 1, 7:30pm at GMHBA Stadium Cats’ Round 11 side B: Z.Guthrie, J.Henry, J.Kolodjashnij HB: T.Stewart - C, M.Holmes, O.Mullin C: O.Dempsey, T.Bruhn, Z.Tuohy HF: T.Stengle, B.Close, G.Miers F: S.Neale, T.Hawkins, O.Henry FOLL: T.Conway, M.Blicavs, M.Duncan I/C: S.De Koning, J.Bowes, T.Atkins, J.Cameron, J.Clark EMG: C.O’Sullivan, S.Mannagh, M.O’Connor Team Tips: Superstar Patrick Dangerfield could be in line for his first match since round eight as he pushes to return from a hamstring injury. Brandan Parfitt had 24 touches after being dropped last week, while young midfielder Mitch Hardie had 36 disposals as he searches for an AFL debut. The Cats will need to find replacements for suspended duo Mark Blicavs and Jhye Clark , who were both handed one-match bans by the MRO. The Cats could recall Rhys Stanley to bolster their ruck division, after young pair Toby Conway and Shannon Neale struggled against the Giants. Shaun Mannagh and James Willis both booted three goals in the VFL as well, while prized draftee Connor O’Sullivan had 16 touches and a goal. Expect Irishman Mark O’Connor, who was an emergency last week, to push for selection as well given his versatility. Tigers’ Round 11 side B: B.Miller, N.Broad, J.Short HB: N.Vlastuin, T.Brown, D.Rioli C: H.Ralphsmith, L.Baker, K.McIntosh HF: M.Pickett, S.Bolton, T.Sonsie F: M.Lefau, D.Martin, N.Balta FOLL: T.Nankervis - C, D.Prestia, T.Dow I/C: S.Campbell, S.Green, K.McAuliffe, S.Ryan, N.Cumberland EMG: K.Smith, S.Banks, T.Young Team Tips: Richmond’s injury crisis continues, with both Shai Bolton (concussion) and Tylar Young (knee) declared unavailable for the clash against Geelong. However, reinforcements could be arriving in the form of Jack Graham and Rhyan Mansell , but don’t expect to see Jacob Hopper back just yet after he suffered a setback in his recovery from a hamstring issue. Adem Yze was far more content with the Tigers output against the Bombers than their past month and given the lack of options at selection, he’ll probably make as few changes as necessary at selection. Jacob Koschitzke (19 disposals, ten marks in VFL) might be preferred in place of Samson Ryan . 'He just wanted to make a statement' | 01:43 MELBOURNE v FREMANTLE Sunday June 2, 1:00pm at TIO Trager Park Demons’ Round 11 side B: J.Bowey, S.May, T.Rivers HB: J.McVee, T.McDonald, A.Tomlinson C: E.Langdon, C.Oliver, C.Windsor HF: A.Neal-Bullen, H.Petty, K.Pickett F: K.Chandler, B.Fritsch, S.McAdam FOLL: M.Gawn - C, J.Viney, C.Petracca I/C: J.van Rooyen, L.Hunter, T.Sparrow, T.Woewodin, C.Salem EMG: J. Billings, B. Howes, T. Fullarton Team Tips: Young key forward Matthew Jefferson booted five goals for Casey and could come into calculations for his first AFL game this weekend, while veteran Ben Brown booted three majors which will put pressure on Harrison Petty , who was subbed out with a foot issue. Former Saint Jack Billings had 24 touches and five clearances after being axed last week, while cult hero in the making Koltyn Tholstrup had 23 disposals. Taj Woewodin and Shane McAdam both struggled to have an impact, while Caleb Windsor might be in need of a rest despite a superb debut season so far. Dockers’ Round 11 side B: H.Chapman, A.Pearce - C, J.Draper HB: J.Aish, L.Ryan, J.Clark C: J.Sharp, A.Brayshaw, H.Young HF: M.Walters, S.Switkowski, L.Jackson F: J.Treacy, J.Amiss, J.O’Meara FOLL: S.Darcy, C.Serong, N.Fyfe I/C: B.Banfield, M.Johnson, T.Emmett, B.Walker, C.Wagner EMG: N.Erasmus, P.Voss, S.Sturt Team Tips: Key forward Patrick Voss continues to dominate in the state leagues, booting five majors in the WAFL on the weekend. Neil Erasmus (33 disposals), Will Brodie (24 disposals) and Karl Worner (24 disposals) all found plenty of the footy. Corey Wagner and Tom Emmett were both quiet against Collingwood on Friday night and might find themselves omitted this week. In a big boost for Justin Longmuir’s side, Michael Frederick is likely to be available assuming he passes through the concussion protocols during the week. Dees destroy Saints in MCG blitzing | 03:05 GOLD COAST SUNS v ESSENDON Sunday June 2, 4pm at People First Stadium Suns’ Round 11 side B: S.Collins, C.Ballard, M.Andrew HB: S.Flanders, B.Uwland, J.Jeffrey C: D.Swallow, T.Miller - C, S.Clohesy HF: J.Walter, B.Long, L.Johnston F: B.King, M.Rowell, J.Lukosius FOLL: J.Witts, N.Anderson, B.Humphrey I/C: A.Sexton, N.Holman, B.Ainsworth, T.Berry, J.Rogers EMG: A.Davies, B.Fiorini, H.Oea Team Tips: A frustrating but not awful loss for the Suns last week, who’ll have confidence in their return home to favourable conditions. They’ll likely be boosted by the return of Malcolm Rosas jnr from a hamstring injury, making Lachie Weller - less than two months away from recovering from his long-term knee injury - the only notable name left on the injury list. They have plenty of options after Ned Moyle , Alex Davies , Sam Day and Brayden Fiorini were omitted out of the Geelong loss last Saturday, with Day bagging four goals in the VFL, and Fiorini’s 37 disposals only outpaced by Rory Atkins (40). The young Will Graham (17 contested possessions, seven clearances) is a more likely inclusion, if Damien Hardwick is keen. Bombers’ Round 11 side B: J.Ridley, B.McKay, J.Laverde HB: N.Martin, M.Redman, A.McGrath C: D.Heppell, S.Durham, J.Kelly HF: J.Gresham, N.Caddy, A.Perkins F: J.Stringer, P.Wright, K.Langford FOLL: T.Goldstein, J.Caldwell, Z.Merrett - C I/C: E.Tsatas, N.Cox, N.Hind, A.Davey Jnr, M.Guelfi EMG: A.Roberts, N.Bryan, J.Menzie Team Tips: A few concentrated concerns in the midfield for the in-form Bombers. Ben Hobbs missed Dreamtime at the ‘G with a calf strain and will be out until at least Round 15; he was likely to get more midfield time with Darcy Parish sidelined with his own calf complaint, and Will Setterfield (knee) estimated to be a week away. Does Dylan Shiel get another chance? He missed the VFL loss to Richmond with illness, with Jye Menzie and Nick Bryan among the best in the reserves. Scans on Nik Cox ’s hamstring issue from Saturday night were positive, with no strain and the club “expecting his symptoms to resolve quite quickly”. Harry Jones should return from his one-week suspension, likely replacing Nate Caddy . Bye week: Brisbane Lions, GWS Giants, North Melbourne, Sydney Swans",

        "content": "DO you care enough for your digestive health? Particularly if you are among the one in three who suffers symptoms such as constipation, bloating or wind. Tomorrow is World Digestive Health Day and we could use a reminder that the digestive system – which includes the giant tube that runs from the mouth to the anus, the liver, gallbladder and pancreas – needs looking after. 3 Dr Zoe Williams shares her top tips for anyone struggling to get a GP appointment Credit: Olivia West For a more comfortable tummy, don’t rush food, skip meals or have large meals before bed. Excess weight, smoking and binge drinking can all increase the chances of acid reflux and heartburn. And de-stress! Stress can either slow down or speed up digestion, and lead to unwanted symptoms. If you feel overwhelmed, breathe in for a four-count, then slowly breathe out until you have no breath left. Most of us do not eat enough fibre. Easy ways to add it include having a large helping of fruit or veg with every meal, adding a can of beans or lentils to dinner, and choosing the brown versions of starchy foods, such as pasta or bread. Here is a selection of what readers have asked this week. BRUTAL FLARE-UPS Q: I HAVE been suffering from diverticulitis for ten years. I’ve had two serious bouts that left me in hospital. Most read in Health BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate Is there anything I can do to help myself when I feel this ­coming on? It normally lasts for up to two weeks at a time, but it can be brutal. A: Diverticulosis is a condition that affects the large intestine, known as the bowel. Davina McCall on what you should know about menopause It is when people have little pouches in the wall of the intestine, called diverticulas, and if they become inflamed or infected it causes diverticulosis. Symptoms can include diarrhoea, bloating, constipation and tummy pain that gets worse after you eat but improves after you pass wind or have a bowel movement. The pain tends to be at the left lower area of the abdomen and sometimes people have blood in their stools. Treatment includes painkillers, ­laxatives, medicines for stomach cramps, and antibiotics if there is an infection. You don’t mention your weight or whether you smoke but the condition can be made worse with excess body weight or smoking. So what can you do? We know that consuming a diet high in ultra-processed items – think packaged foods or anything that is not in its raw, original state – can exacerbate the symptoms. In fact, some studies suggest it’s a condition caused by Western diets. So try to avoid too much heavily processed food and eat plenty of fruit, vegetables and whole foods. A high-fibre diet has been shown to reduce episodes of diverticulitis too, so foods such as avocados, broccoli, almonds and lentils can help. A word of warning, though. While raising our fibre intake is something that most of us will benefit from in the long run, it’s important to increase it slowly and gradually, or else it can cause tummy discomfort, bloating and other unpleasant­ ­symptoms. What is the menopause and how does it affect women? The menopause is a transitional period all women go through in mid-life. Hormones related to the reproductive system deplete namely oestrogen, over a period of time. This doesn’t just cause periods to stop. Sex hormones act all over the body, from the brain, skin, vagina and more. Therefore, dozens of symptoms affect all areas of the body, to varying degrees. Women’s experiences of menopause vary greatly. While some breeze through it, others’ lives are significantly impacted. It can feel as though it lasts a couple of years, or for decades. It cannot be predicted how each woman will fare. When is menopause? Perimenopause is when symptoms start but periods have not yet stopped, although they will be irregular. This can start in the early 40s. Menopause is when periods have completely stopped for a year. The average age this happens is 51, but it can be any time from 45 to 55, according to the NHS. The term ‘menopause’ is used to describe the experience overall. Menopause before the age of 45 is called early menopause, affecting five per cent of women. Menopause before the age of 40 is called premature menopause, affecting one per cent of women before 40 and 0.1 per cent of women under 30. This may happen for no clear reason, but also as a result of surgery, genetics or medications. A year after that the final period, a woman is considered to be entering the post-menopausal stage. How does it impact a woman’s life? The menopause can be an extremely testing time in a woman’s life and for those around her. The body is going through a significant change, and the symptoms that come with it can feel alien, with women sometimes describing a loss of sense of self. Physical symptoms include hot flushes (a sudden feeling of heat in the face, neck and chest), difficulty sleeping, night sweats, heart palpitations, headaches, muscle and joint aches, weight skin, skin changes, reduced libido, vaginal dryness and more. Symptoms affecting mental health or cognition include brain fog, memory loss, low mood, anxiety, low self-esteem and irritation. There are ways to manage symptoms and cope with menopause - and women need to know that they are not alone in facing it. Medication, such as HRT or oestrogen gel, can help attack the symptoms. However, experts often say it needs a rounded approach incorporating good lifestyle habits, such as a balanced diet and less alcohol. Many women report that their life began after menopause after it drew them to a healthier way of living. However, the huge burden it can have - on work, family life and more - is important for society to recognise, as adapting policies at work, for example, can make it easier for women to stick with their job.

As well as night and daytime sweats, she has forgetfulness, mood swings, painful periods, poor sleep and has lost interest in sex. 3 Dr Zoe helps a reader suffering with night and daytime sweats Credit: Getty She has seen several doctors and they basically say, “It’s one of those things” or, “She’s too young to be going through these things”. I’m sure my daughter is not the only one suffering like this. She has tried herbal remedies to no avail. She’s a busy working mum and generally healthy, but I can see the change in her over the last year. Do you have any advice? A: It’s not uncommon for women in their late 30s and early 40s to begin experiencing symptoms of perimenopause, which for many, can last four to eight years. The average age of menopause (one year after your last period) is 51, but around five per cent of women, experience it by the age of 45. What age did you reach menopause? Numerous studies show genetics play a strong role in determining the age of menopause. Women who are black or Asian reach menopause earlier, on average, than white women, according to a huge US study. Given the severity of her symptoms and the impact on her quality of life, your daughter needs to find a doctor or nurse who takes her concerns seriously and offers appropriate support and treatment options. It’s also important to rule out other conditions such as abnormal thyroid function, anaemia, B12 deficiency and hypertension, if this hasn’t been done already. Get her to ask if the practice has a doctor or nurse who has a special interest in women’s health. She can submit an e-consult online if she’s reluctant to return. Of course, she could see a private menopause specialist if financially possible. If HRT or other medication is commenced, she could ask her NHS GP to take over the prescribing. It’s important we all advocate for ourselves during medical appointments and it’s easier to do this if we have done some prior research. Good resources include nhs.uk, patient.info and for menopause- related issues, thebms.org.uk. Take a written list of symptoms and be prepared to give a timeline of how and when they started, and how they affect everyday life. High BMI is thwarting son’s hip op Q: FOUR years ago my son had an accident at work and broke his hip. He is 42. After a scan, the surgeon said his BMI of 35 was too high for a hip replacement. He stated it needs to be 30. 3 And Dr Zoe also helps another reader who broke his hip Credit: Getty My son is struggling to lose weight as he cannot exercise or move around very easily. He went back to his GP who further advised him to “starve”. What would your advice be? A: This is a really difficult position for your son to be in. NICE guidance on arthritis states that BMI should not be used to exclude people from referral to surgery – but restrictive policies are still in use in some regions. In your son’s case, it sounds as though the problem is due to a hip fracture, rather than arthritis per se. While we know hip replacements work well when they have less weight to bear, it does seem unfair to me that a person would be excluded without being offered professional support to lose weight. In some areas, surgical teams delay ­surgery but provide a weight-loss-support programme. My advice is to return to the GP and see what support is available for your son. If he tries this and still has a BMI of 35 then I think you are well within your rights to seek a second opinion with another surgeon, possibly at a different hospital. You can check the average wait time to be seen at different hospitals at myplannedcare.nhs.uk. In the meantime, a few dietary tips for him: He needs fibre, fluid and whole foods and to avoid white processed carbohydrates as much as possible. Oatmeal, peanut butter on wholemeal toast or eggs are great breakfast ideas, and roasted vegetable salad or soup (with protein) are good for lunch. Dinner should be lean proteins Such as chicken breast with lots of salad or veg.

        "content": "James Schiller has opened up on why he’s signed with the Knights from next season, admitting he had “a lot of sleepless nights” while mulling over the decision. Schiller has inked a three-year deal with the Knights from next season and despite it being a “very hard” decision the 22-year-old hasn’t let it show in his footy. Schiller scored a first-half hat-trick while playing centre in the Raiders’ 36-28 win over the Roosters in New South Wales Cup. He also finished the game with two linebreaks, seven tackle busts and 275 running metres, while also making seven tackles with zero misses.

Start your free trial today > Speaking to Fox League post-game, Schiller revealed the performance had come just a fortnight after he had Covid-19. He also spoke for the first time about his upcoming move to Newcastle, revealing the opportunity to forge a career at centre was the big luring factor. Schiller, who played five NRL games on the wing this season before being dropped, will likely be stuck behind Dane Gagai and Bradman Best in 2025 after the former re-signed for two more years. But his path will become clearer once 33-year-old Gagai retires — as opposed to at the Raiders where Matt Timoko and Seb Kris are 24 and 25 respectively. Luai excited to partner Hynes in halves | 01:29 “There was a lot to weigh up with that one,” Schiller conceded. “It wasn’t taken lightly, it took me a couple of months to think about. “I’ve got an opportunity up there to play centre and explore my game more at centre. “I could’ve stayed here definitely and worked away on the wing. It’s no disrespect to Matty (Timoko) and Seb (Kris) but you’ve got to be realistic in these situations and they’re two international footballers that I know I’ll be behind for a while. “I’m honoured to be behind them and even playing outside some of them but I just had to do what’s best for me. “I’ve done my time here in Canberra and I’ve got family up in Newcastle I’d like to spend a bit more time with as well. “It was a very hard one to think about — lots of sleepless night — but I’m excited for it and it’s definitely a good change.” Read on for the latest Reserve Grade Wrap. ALL EYES WERE ON... Two weeks after suffering a first-round knockout loss to Kenny Niko, NRL star-turned boxer Tevita Pangai Junior returned to the rugby league field. Pangai Junior played Round 1 for Souths Logan — feeder side to the Broncos — but then turned his attention to his professional boxing career. The 28-year-old said after the fight that he “will rebuild and go back to footy” — and he returned with a bang over the weekend. Pangai Junior started at prop in the Magpies’ loss to Pride and finished with 171 running metres, four tackle busts and three offloads, while also making 18 tackles with zero misses. Blake Taaffe had a chance to prove his worth in the halves with the 25-year-old donning the No.7 in the Bulldogs’ loss to the Dragons. His kicking game was hot and cold with one grubber rebounding off the posts for Taaffe to score, while another kick went dead. He ran for 67 metres and made 26 tackles but also missed seven.

Meanwhile, his older brother Haele brought plenty of spark off the bench. The 23-year-old hooker set up a try, got two linebreak assists, four tackle busts and was rewarded with a try of his own out of dummy-half. The Couchman twins once again go through a mountain off work up front. Toby finished with 20 runs for 210 metres — 109 post-contact — a linebreak assist, five tackle busts and 33 tackles with zero misses. And that was in 57 minutes on the field. Ryan played the full 80 minutes and finished with 22 runs for 211 metres — 106 post-contact — and 44 tackles, one miss. The Raiders have an exciting prospect in Noah Martin coming through the ranks. The 19-year-old made his NSW Cup debut in Round 5 and on the weekend had his best performance to date. Martin, who is on a development deal and moves into the Top 30 in 2026, played 80 minutes for the first time and finished with a try assist, a linebreak, five tackle busts, 122 metres and 30 tackles — one miss. The Roosters staged a second-half comeback to almost snatch the win from the Raiders but ultimately fell away in the final 10 minutes. Central to their turnaround was teenage five-eighth Jake Elliott , who scored a double, set up two more tries, got a linebreak, a linebreak assist, four tackle busts and 86 running metres. Ethan King also tried his guts out after being a late switch before kick-off to fullback — his preferred position — to replace the injured Callum Gromek. King scored a try, got a linebreak, five tackle busts and 182 running metres. He also soldiered on with tape around his nose after copping a nasty knock. Siua Wong is expected to get some opportunities in first grade during the Origin period and he proved he is more than ready for a recall. While Wong has mainly played on an edge in the NRL, he’s spent some time at prop in NSW Cup in recent weeks. The 21-year-old punched out 80 minutes in the middle and finished with a team-high of 224 running metres as well as 20 tackles, no misses. Newtown have four wins on the trot after smashing the depleted Panthers 44-6. Centre Chris Vea’ila bagged a hat-trick, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, six tackle busts and ran 153 metres, while Sam Stonestreet scored a double on the wing, got two linebreaks and ran 147 metres. Young fullback Liam Ison was electric too, finishing with a try assist, a linebreak, two linebreak assists, seven tackle busts and 178 metres. The Eels are also enjoying a run of form. After waiting until Round 6 to get their first win of the season, they’re now on a four-game winning streak. Teenage playmaker Ethan Sanders had the ball on a string in their most recent win over the Rabbitohs, setting up two tries, getting a linebreak, a linebreak assist, four tackle busts and 75 running metres. He also made 14 tackles with zero misses. Zac Cini was electric at fullback, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak assist, nine tackle busts and 178 metres. Meanwhile, Luca Moretti got through a mountain of work at prop, including a try assist, a linebreak, 147 metres and 35 tackles — three misses. In a losing side Chase Chapman was impressive with the 23-year-old lock notching up 141 metres and 22 tackles with no misses. The Bears’ tryscoring machine Allan Fitzgibbon added two more to his tally to nine tries in eight appearances this season — and overall 45 tries in 49 NSW Cup games. Fullback Jake Toby was everywhere, as per usual, in the 22-16 win over the Warriors, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, 10 tackle busts and 225 running metres. It was a try-athon in Blacktown’s 50-30 win over the Magpies with 16 tries being scored between the two teams. 11 of those tries were through Blacktown and four were scored by Clayton Faulalo , while another four were scored by Jaxson Paulo . Faulalo, who shifted to fullback while Lehi Hopoate made his NRL debut, also set up three tries, got two linebreaks, four linebreak assists, eight tackle busts and 261 metres. Paulo set up a try and notched up four linebreaks as well as 210 metres. Jake Arthur , who will get some opportunities in NRL during the Origin period, bagged a try and set up two more. He also made 18 tackles with zero misses at halfback. 'I have matured since the last series' | 01:25 QUEENSLAND CUP The Cowboys’ back-up playmaker Jake Clifford had a day out for feeder side Northern Pride, scoring a double, setting up a try, getting two linebreaks and running 130 metres in their 40-22 win over Souths Logan. Will Partridge also bagged a double in the centres and ran over 150 metres, while towering second-rower Dane Aukafolau scored to take his season tally to seven tries in eight games. He also ran for 141 metres and made 28 tackles with one miss. Dolphins halfback Joshua James was instrumental in his side’s 13-4 win over Burleigh. The 23-year-old set up a try, kicked two conversions from two attempts and slotted a field goal in the 79th minute. It’s been a tough trot for the Ipswich Jets, who sit last on the ladder with just one win. The club parted ways with coach Ben Cross early last week and then they were thrashed 50-16 by Norths Devils on the weekend. Norths five-eighth Gerome Burns scored 26 of those points with three tries and seven conversions from nine attempts. Burns also finished with six tackle busts, a linebreak, 114 metres and 19 tackles — two misses. Blake Paskins also had a lot of joy on the wing with two tries, two linebreaks, six tackle busts and 133 metres, while Tuki Simpkins led from the front with 121 metres and 18 tackles, no misses. Mackay snapped a four-game losing streak with a 40-26 win over PNG Hunters with halves Riley Dean and Jaxon Purdue stealing the show. Dean scored a try and set up two more, while also getting a linebreak, two linebreak assists and 127 running metres. Purdue was unstoppable with a try, a try assist, three linebreaks, seven tackle busts and 210 metres. Josh Smith was also a handful in the centres, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, 10 tackle busts and 172 metres. Sione Hopoate was enormous for Wynnum Manly in their 38-32 win over Western Clydesdales, scoring a second-half double — with one try ending up to be the matchwinner. He also set up a try, got a linebreak, a linebreak assist, seven tackle busts and 151 running metres SPOTTED Raiders forward Jordan Martin returned from an ACL injury on Saturday and celebrated it with a try in the 77th minute. His younger brother, Noah was one of the first players to run in and get around him. Aaron Schoupp was parachuted straight into Blacktown Workers’ line-up after gaining a mid-season release from the Titans to join Manly. The powerful centre finished with 172 metres from 14 runs, five tackle busts and nine tackles with two misses.",

        "description": "Michelle Hamilton was a longtime nurse before starting Dandelion Naturals, a soap-making business, in 2022 that aligns with her holistic health approach.",
        "content": "HAYFIELD, Minn. — A longtime local nurse is using her skills in a new career. “My nursing career has really prepared me for this specific business because there is a lot of math and science that goes into the soap-making process,” said Michelle Hamilton, owner of Dandelion Naturals, a homemade, natural soap company based in Hayfield. “Just formulating recipes, you need to understand the science and the math behind that. That's really helped on the patient or the customer side of things. I get so many people asking me health-related things like skin-related questions. It's at every market that I go to and we get emails from customers, so I feel like I'm still able to be a nurse in that regard and help people and suggest products that work for them.” Hamilton’s health journey to a more holistic and natural lifestyle began in 2011 when she saw a holistic chiropractor. From there she began to make changes to her lifestyle with her husband. “It just kind of opened up my eyes to just there's more out there for healing and for things that we can do naturally to even prevent disease and things,” Hamilton said. “It all started with just eating real whole foods and it just evolved from there. We bought an acreage. We've been out here for 10 years. We live on 10 acres. We have chickens and we have apple trees and we have a garden. I was dabbling in working with medicinal plants that grow around here. So we like nettle. We work with dandelions and comfrey and all these things. I taught myself all of that.” Hamilton wanted to make an all-natural soap company with the hopes of expanding into other products and she has. Dandelion Naturals has products in stores in 29 states across the country. She hopes to get her products into every state this year. ADVERTISEMENT “Our laundry soap is probably our most popular product right now,” said Hamilton. . She offers many items such as lip balms, medicinal salves, lotion bars, and shampoo and conditioner bars. But she started with bar soaps with 50 varieties. Hamilton likes to keep as many of her ingredients as local as possible. She has a local beekeeper near Rice Lake for honey and uses cow's milk instead of goat's milk because she has a source for it closer. Hamilton also grows some of the herbs she uses in her products on her farm. “I also love our unscented soap,” she said. “I would say probably our tallow bar is my favorite thing that we make. It just has a natural scent to it, which I absolutely love because it's just so wholesome. I don't know how to explain it. It smells like oatmeal to me.\" Hamilton also wanted to make products for the whole family. She makes unscented bars in fun animal shapes that are safe and healthy for little kids. “I just wanted something that specifically stood out that is for kids,” Hamilton said. “I think so many products on the market today for kids they shouldn't be using, like it's not safe for them and this is our most gentle bar soap.” Currently, the Dandelion Naturals team consists of Hamilton and four other women who help produce soap. Her current space can produce 640 bars of soap a day but they have to cure for four to six weeks. “The cold process method is basically the oldest form of making soap really,” Hamilton said. “In my opinion, (it's) the purest way of making soap and really the most labor intensive. You're basically starting from scratch. It's like you're making a loaf of bread from scratch. You're grinding your flour, you know all the things but with soap, you're getting all of your oils measured out. You're getting your hard oils, your liquid oils, you're measuring that out and then you're mixing in your lye solution.” ADVERTISEMENT The team is outgrowing the farmhouse the company currently operates out of. Since most of her business is online, she hopes to move into a commercial space with more room to produce and store her products. Dandelion Naturals is also a plastic-free company, so the team has been working to figure out packaging that works best. Dandelion Naturals will cut down on market events when that does come, but Hamilton is excited to continue going to new and regular locations throughout the summer. One place you will be able to catch her is at Thursdays Downtown. She is grateful for the support she has received from her husband, who helps out on busy weekends, and her 5-year-old daughter who comes out to spend time with her at events. “I think that we are truly a small business and we have hands on the whole process,” Hamilton said. “Everything that we make is from us. We don't source things and just flop our label on it. It is truly all-natural and we really care about the products that we make. It's safe for the whole family to use.”",

Login or signup to continue reading The online graphic design and multimedia platform hosted its full-day 'Canva Create' event at Hollywood Park on Thursday, May 23. The company was founded in Perth in 2013 by Melanie Perkins, Cliff Orbrecht and Cameron Adams. Bursting into a Hamilton-esque hip hop performance, a male rapper told the crowd of all that Canva had to offer. \"You can redesign your work, Canva got that glow-up, we redesign everything from the floor up,\" he sang. In the two minutes and 20 seconds show, a woman playing the part of a sceptical enterprise CIO joined the beige-clad dancers on stage. She raised some doubts about Canva's ability to meet the \"demands of a global machine\" and \"integrate all of our systems easily\". Canva's rapper sang of automated licensing and compliancy, system integration, tailored APIs, and artificial intelligence training. Eventually convinced, the 'CIO' rapped about how \"much we love Canva 'till the end\". \"You've opened my eyes to Canva Enterprise,\" she said. Canva Enterprise is a newly launched subscription software aimed at large organisations. The musical display has been ruthlessly mocked by social media users on X, formerly Twitter. American comedian Gianmarco Soresi said \"This is Lin Manuel Miranda's fault\", while another user said \"this is why Australian companies should stop hiring Americans\". \"Feels like one of those stage performances to [sic] for kids to warn them of the dangers of drugs,\" one X user said. Another user posted that while the performance was cringey, they would still use Canva. \"Omg, I'd have to step out, I couldn't sit through that,\" another commented.

        "content": "Copy link Copied Copy link Copied Subscribe to gift this article Gift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe. Already a subscriber? Login M att Heine is clearly an ideas guy. Indeed the chief executive of online wealth platforms provider Netwealth is a self-proclaimed “ideas fountain”. This has its upsides, but Heine has also learnt the trait doesn’t always work in the top job. He’s walked into many meetings spouting ideas, and sent the people around him into a frenzy. Matt Heine is chief executive of Netwealth. Louie Douvis “It’s what they would call an ‘accidental diminishing trait’ where I think I’m doing something positive, but it’s actually diminishing or disempowering the people around me,” Heine says. One tool Heine uses to enable him to let loose on the ideas front without scaring employees is to ask permission to brainstorm at the beginning of a meeting. By doing so, he makes it clear he is not expecting team members to go off and work on the ideas. “It’s actually saying, ‘can we have a discussion?’” Heine says. Listen below or stream 15 Minutes with the BOSS on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. Here is an edited transcript of Sally Patten’s conversation with Matt Heine. Sally Patten: What time do you get up? When do you have your first cup of coffee, assuming that you are a coffee person? Matt Heine: I try and exercise three or four times a week, which will include a combination of personal training and weights at the gym and also running. Usually, I try and get up at about 6.15 or 6.30am. That’s depending on the kids. I’m not really a morning person, so I’ve had to train myself since having kids to get up a little bit earlier just to try and fit in all the things that I like to do. I try not to look at my phone until 8am which I’m failing miserably at, at the moment. I typically will get up in the morning, look at my Oura Ring stats to see how I slept. I’ll then inevitably scroll through the AFR , see what’s happened overnight and what I’m likely to face during the day. I don’t eat breakfast if I can avoid it, but I’ll definitely have two or three large cups of coffee. What are you tracking with the Oura Ring? Sleep, REM sleep? I’m pretty fastidious about my sleep hygiene, but that doesn’t mean I’m a good sleeper. I’m a shocking sleeper, and often if I think I’ve had a bad night’s sleep, it’ll tell me I’ve actually had a good night’s sleep and I just need to get on with it. So it’s good little pep talk. Other times it might just be we’re travelling a lot, plenty going on, so I just take it a little bit easier during the day and maybe instead of doing a weight session I’ll go for a walk or something else. So I find it really, really helpful, and it’s a great way to set habits and to track the positive outcomes of behaviours. For example, I try and eat as early as possible, so dinner at 5 or 5.30 with the kids would be ideal because I actually find that eating late has a huge impact on my sleep. I try not to drink during the week. Even one or two glasses of wine will have a material impact on REM. I’ll just feel pretty groggy or tired in the morning. So it’s all those sorts of things. Being able to actually see the outcomes and the benefits of either good behaviour or bad behaviour just helps set the day well. Was there a point in your career that really shaped the trajectory of what you were doing or changed you in some really critical way? Probably the [Netwealth stockmarket] listing in 2017 . I think certainly there was a huge amount of learning to get to that point and subsequent to listing, we are always learning and trying to do things better, whether that’s communicating with shareholders, stakeholders, learning how to manage the business. It’s been incredible for me. So what have you learned about having to deal with lots of different stakeholders? Stakeholder management is probably the biggest part of my job when I think about it. We interact with pretty much every part of the financial services market, whether that’s financial advisors, with the ASX, or running a superannuation trustee. We’ve got a very big technology team now. Almost half our staff are technology so that’s a very dynamic environment to be operating in. You do need to be a very good communicator and that’s probably something that I’ve had to learn on the job, and I’m constantly refining. And how do you go about balancing all the needs of the various stakeholders? I guess it’s about trying to make sure you prioritise the right things at the right time, which sounds easier than it is, and making sure that you are quite disciplined around what you’re working on at any given time. Something that I’m not particularly good at is saying no. So I have to find ways that I can either defer conversations or things that might need to be done or just say, “look, now’s not the right time to be talking about this” has become increasingly important, but it’s 12 to 15 hours in a day, and you get through what you need to. It’s actually about making sure that we’re always working on the most important thing at the right time . And it might be that I’d really love to do something or to have a conversation or to catch up with someone, but that now’s not the right time given other things that are more pressing or need to take priority. So it might be that we still want to do something, but we do it in two or three months time. What is the best career advice you’ve ever been given? I think it was Dad that gave it to me. A lot of people have really good ideas, but it’s the ability to actually execute those ideas that will be the difference between success or failure. So make sure that if you have got an idea that you give it a go, that you’re not afraid of failure, but equally if you do fail, make sure that it’s a small bet – that it’s not going to take down the company, and importantly that you actually learn from those failures or what hasn’t worked before. So that ability to fail fast has been critical, but also being able to run with an idea where you think it’s got legs. One of the things that I’m trying at home at the moment with my kids is “start with yes until it’s a no”. I think that that gives a really good outlook on life, where rather than deciding you’re not going to like something or that you’re not going to try something, give it a go. And if it’s not for you, that’s fine, but at least you know that you’ve given it a shot and that it’s not something you want to go forward with. Do you think you are stronger on the ideas front or on the execution front? I can be accused of being an ideas fountain. I think that’s great and really helpful. Other people might not agree and might be overwhelmed or find that it’s actually difficult for them to then prioritise or work on the right thing if I’m constantly coming up with new ideas. One of the ways that I’m looking to deal with that is when I walk into a meeting actually calling it out upfront and just saying, “can I have permission to brainstorm” so that it’s very clear that it’s not me actually saying, “can you go away and work on these three new ideas?” It’s actually saying, “can we have a discussion? Here’s some things that I’m thinking about or the business is thinking about that we think might be worth exploring. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s now a priority and you have to go away and work on it.” Do you have a favourite productivity hack to help you get more out of your day? I’ve stopped wearing a watch. I used to have an Apple watch and a Garmin for when I was running, and I found that it was beeping and flashing and tapping me so regularly it was incredibly distracting. So I now don’t wear a watch, which has been quite refreshing. [Microsoft] Outlook’s also got a really great feature that I use quite a lot called focus time, where at the start of the week you can ask it to block out time during the week where you just don’t want to be interrupted and not have meetings booked over the top. I’ll actually go through and find half-hour or hour-long blocks within the calendar each day and just put them in as focus time. So I’ve found that’s actually really effective. And then it is a conscious choice whether you actually book something over the top of it, but you know that if someone else is trying to schedule a meeting with you that it’s already blocked out. Does half an hour work for you? I would think it’s not really enough time to do anything really nitty-gritty. I think one of the downsides of virtual meetings is that the tendency is to roll from one to the next, to the next, to the next. It’s not uncommon that you’ve suddenly done eight back to back meetings with no breaks. I’ve found it actually forces you to have that time in your diary as opposed to, as I mentioned, going from one meeting to the next and then having to catch up for the whole day at 9 or 10 o’clock at night. So I think from a mental perspective, being able to have a bit more time just to reflect on either a meeting you’ve just been in, think about what the meeting might be that you’re going into, or catch up on some emails or a phone call if you need to. It’s one of the first productivity hacks I think that Microsoft actually introduced, but it’s not particularly well known. The other one is just some of the new Co-pilot tools. That’s the Microsoft version of OpenAI. They are seriously incredible as far as productivity hacks go, we can summarise an hour long meeting that I might miss, or don’t want to attend, very quickly to five dot points. The Co-pilot will automatically transcribe the meeting, work out action items, work out who needs to do what, as well as allowing you to jump between different speakers throughout the course of the meeting. So all of the tools coming from Microsoft at the moment are absolutely focused on productivity and you need to explore them. So are you attending fewer meetings as a result? Definitely. So it’s not that I necessarily do it deliberately, but it means that if I do need to miss one for a particular reason, I know that I can always go back to that meeting (where it’s been a virtual meeting obviously), and quickly catch up on what the key items were. Co-pilot it will allow you to automatically summarise group emails. One of my pet hates is group emails, whereas this will take a whole chain and just tell you very quickly what are the key points, what needs to be done, and that can save three, four minutes. And the thing that I’ve been saying to colleagues and people that are asking about Co-pilot is it’s not necessarily just three or four minutes on that task, it’s when you start to add up all those three or four minutes that it becomes quite meaningful and you could easily get back half an hour, an hour of your day just through using the different tools in different ways for different jobs. You could deliberately stop going to some meetings where your presence is not really necessary, I imagine. And then you’re saving half hour blocks, hour blocks, maybe two hour blocks. Absolutely. And if it does turn out that it was a meeting that I should have been at or needed to be at, you can then easily just watch the video. What’s your favourite podcast or streaming show and why? The obvious answer is my own podcast Between Meetings with Matt Heine , but I’m an avid podcast and audiobook listener. During the day, if I can, I’ll listen to Multipliers by Liz Wiseman. It’s about how you empower and get more out of your staff and colleagues through the power of delegation, empowering the senior leadership team and each level down. I think what they’re suggesting and what the research says is that most staff are probably operating at about 70 or 80 per cent, and there’s a whole range of reasons for that. But if you can actually empower them and give them a framework for decision-making, you can increase that or move the dial to 120 per cent. So you can imagine as businesses grow and scale, making sure that you’re actually getting the most out of all your staff and that they’re feeling rewarded and satisfied is critical. And are there some key points in doing that? Is it about giving them more autonomy or are there key themes in that? Yeah, it’s largely about the manager, so a lot of it’s quite self-reflective. And I touched on before that I can be an ideas fountain, that is what they would call an ‘accidental diminishing trait’ where I think I’m doing something positive, but it’s actually diminishing or disempowering the people that are around me or that I work with because they feel overwhelmed, and they don’t need to necessarily come up with the ideas because Matt will do it. So this is actually about saying, here’s a problem, here’s something that we’d like to solve. What do you think? Or can you go away and work on this and come back with some suggestions or recommendations? So really putting the decision-making power back into the business and the creativity back into the business. What is your favourite party story you like to share? When I was 12 I was actually held up at gunpoint, so that one is a pretty good story. Basically mum and dad were going out for dinner. They were going out to a ball I think, and I was at home with my brother. He was upstairs. And as they got to the end of the road, dad realised (this is going back obviously many years) that there wasn’t any paper in the fax machine. That’s how far back we’re going. He came back home, went into the cupboard where the fax machine was, and as he did, two people in balaclavas came out when he started screaming. I started to get up from the room next door and very quickly was told to stay on the ground and not move by one of the gentlemen in the IRA style balaclava pointing a gun at me. So there’s a lot more that happened off the back of that, but suffice to say, we’re all safe and no one got hurt. Did it take you long to recover from that being just a kid? I definitely would check the locks and keep the lights on at night for as long as I could. Do you still think about that incident? Does it impact you in some way today? No, not so much. Thankfully, today it’s more just a good party story. If you had 12 months off unencumbered, you could do anything you’d like, you could take the family or not take the family, what would you do? I think I’d be bored for 12 months. I don’t mind a holiday, one of the bad habits that I learned from my father was to always take January off, and I find that after about two and a half, three weeks I start to get a little bit itchy and need to do things. So there’s only so long I can lie on the beach, but I try and make sure that we have a good time as a family throughout the year. We go skiing and go to the beach. But if push came to shove and I had to take 12 months off, I’d love to go overseas and live somewhere in a foreign country for six months or so and learn Spanish or French. When you start to get twitchy on your summer holiday, do you start dialling into the office or checking your emails, or how do you cope with that? Usually it starts with just checking in on emails and then I will end up responding to emails and generating my own. So how long do you think you could comfortably take off without getting too bored? Maximum two to three months, I think. as long as I was doing something interesting and it was keeping myself occupied, So if you were skiing, I guess that would at least give you something to do physically every day and perhaps prevent you from looking at your phone all the time. The beauty about skiing overseas, particularly in the United States, which I was lucky enough to do over Christmas, is that it gets dark and cold at about 3.30pm, which just happens to be when Australia comes online.

        "content": "STANDING in the doorway of her home, mum-of-four Sarah Smith thought of desperate excuses to turn away the man who stood on her step. Once a family friend who had lent her and husband Anthony cash for Christmas, he had turned into a sex-crazed loan shark who offered her an “easy” way out of debt. “Put on some sexy underwear and we can come to an arrangement,” he told her. Sarah, who point-blank refused, is among thousands of women across the country being targeted by twisted, heartless lenders pushing some victims to the brink of suicide. Frightened borrowers have shared shocking stories of exploitation, violence and blackmail. One shark even offered to send a gang of men to a woman’s home for sex “while the kids are at school”. Our exclusive statistics reveal that almost one in ten female borrowers have been asked to clear debt through sex. It is the first time such figures have been recorded by England’s Illegal Money Lending Team, a group of specialist investigators and officers. Sarah and Anthony, 39, who live in the West Midlands , borrowed around £10,000 over 15 years but were unable to make payments when Covid hit and they suffered health issues. Anthony, who was paying 70 per cent interest on the loan, said: “It was then the shark began putting pressure on me and started being intimidating, coming out with comments to my wife in front of our 14-year-old daughter. “He asked my wife to wear sexy bras and pants and stuff like that. “We heard from other people that he was trying to make out that if they gave him sexual favours, it would pay some money off.” The Sun can today reveal the terror Britain’s loan sharks hold over skint families — many struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. Almost half of those targeted are in work but have been hit hard by rising food and energy bills. Care worker Paula, 28, of Leeds, told how a shark pestered her for sex before suggesting she become a prostitute to pay off her debt. She was introduced to the lender through a friend at work and borrowed £100. Paula faced what is known as “double bubble” interest, where the amount owing doubles each week. It was tripled the week after if she failed to pay. She soon owed £3,000. She said: “The lender contacted my parents telling them I owe money. “He came to my workplace to intimidate me. I closed my Facebook account for fear of what he might post on there. I felt trapped. “He pestered me for sex and I was told to become a prostitute to pay off what I owed. “I could never do that, but at one point it did seem like it might be the only way out. “It was more the pestering for sex that felt so overwhelming.” Paula’s nightmare only came to an end when she was contacted by the Illegal Money Lending Team, which was already investigating the man. Jane, a mum of three who borrowed from someone she knew at work, was left petrified when she changed her phone number and the lender threatened to kill her. ﻿The loan shark contacted my family to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. I went to a bridge and was going to jump off. Only the thought of my kids stopped me The 52-year-old, of South London, revealed: “They contacted family members to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. “I went to a bridge and was going to jump off because of the threats. Only the thought of my children stopped me from doing it.” Delivery driver Sunny, 26, from Devon, found an illegal lender online after becoming so financially strapped he went without food to make sure his kids ate. He said: “On paper my income looks great, but in reality we were constantly playing catch-up paying her off.” All these victims, who told their stories to the IMLT, were too frightened to reveal their real identities to The Sun for fear of retribution. An estimated one million borrowers owe money to loan sharks, according to a report published by the Centre for Social Justice. This figure has more than tripled since 2010. New statistics from the IMLT reveal that 31 per cent of borrowers have contemplated or attempted suicide, while three in ten have been threatened or assaulted by lenders. IMLT expert Catherine Wohlers said: “Nine per cent of female borrowers we helped last year have been told they can clear their debt with sexual favours. “Some of the suggestions are quite explicit and upfront, but others are less so, such as, ‘It would be nice if you could be wearing something nice when I come round’. “One woman was told, ‘If I send some men around when the kids are at school that could sort your debt’.” Catherine says almost half of those taking loans from sharks are low earners or families in financial crisis. She added: “We’ve seen a change in the reasons why people use them. “Many are now borrowing for food and fuel, when it would historically be for one-off expenses like a new car tyre, school uniforms or for Christmas. It’s a myth that everyone who borrows is on benefits. More than 40 per cent are working, some in low-paid jobs, or maybe their circumstances have changed due to a relationship breakdown, bereavement or business collapse. “The youngest borrower we helped last year was 19 and the oldest 91. The highest amount loaned was £99,000 and the person concerned paid back £450,000 over 25 years. “Half of borrowers went without food, fuel or making priority payments in order to pay their loan.” The figures also show eight per cent found loan sharks on social media, double the amount in 2022. The revelations come after one of Britain’s most violent loan sharks was this month jailed for seven years for kidnap, GBH and illegal money lending. Richard Dawson, 35, from Barnsley , bundled his victim into the boot of his car and drove him to a cashpoint to make payments. Sheffield Crown Court heard how vicious, tattooed Dawson collected £52,000 from 88 “customers”. He once broke the jaw of a man who could not pay up. His barrister Sean Fritchley said Dawson’s actions sounded “like something from The Sopranos” but that his client was “ashamed”. Judges have also jailed a number of pensioner loan sharks — including the country’s oldest at 83. Two Filipino hospital workers preyed on immigrant colleagues, lending them £4.2million over a 16-year period. Luz Guerra Villar, 67, and Leticia Manipol, 71, were given suspended jail sentences in 2021 after admitting illegal lending and money laundering. They were last month ordered to pay back £1.2million by a court in South London. It is the largest amount confiscated in 14 years. Gangster great-granny Tabitha Richardson lent neighbours and “friends” £120,000 over 20 years. The 83-year-old from Newport, South Wales, was described as “threatening and menacing” while charging 40 per cent interest on six-month loans. She was handed a two-year suspended sentence last August after admitting her illegal business. Last month she was ordered to pay back £173,000. Tony Quigley, head of the IMLT, said: “Illegal lenders often live a life of luxury while people who have borrowed from them struggle. “It’s only right that these criminals are not only prosecuted but are at last made to pay back at least some of their ill-gotten gains.” Sarah and husband Anthony are now picking up their lives. He said: “It still angers me because I have been made to feel like a fool. “To find out afterwards there were so many other people he was making money off makes me so angry. “It’s a vile thing to have hanging over your head. It’s like being stuck in a never-ending hellhole.”",

        "description": "Boston should run away with this one and advance to the NBA Finals.",
        "content": "Heartbreak is too light of a description for what the Pacers and their fans have experienced in the Eastern Conference finals against the Celtics. The Pacers gave Game 1 away; there is no other way to put it. Then, in Game 2, Tyrese Haliburton aggravated a hamstring injury that kept him out of Saturday’s devastating Game 3 loss in which Indiana blew an eight-point lead in the final 2:26. Now, the Pacers face an 0-3 hole that no team in NBA playoff history has ever overcome. If Haliburton misses Game 4, as expected, it’s difficult to see a path that gets them beyond Memorial Day. The Pacers threw everything they had at Boston in Game 3 and still could not come away with a victory. In fact, Andrew Nembhard posted a career-high 32 points, while adding nine assists and four rebounds. Additionally, Indiana got fantastic outings from Myles Turner and T.J. McConnell. Turner finished with 22 points and 10 rebounds, while McConnell posted 23 points, nine rebounds, and six assists. The Pacers can’t possibly expect to get that kind of output and efficiency from those three players again in this series against a Boston team that has Jrue Holiday and Derrick White, two of the best defensive guards in the league. Furthermore, the Celtics survived 68 points in the paint from Indiana and a seven-rebound deficit. That won’t likely happen again. Boston should run away with this one and advance to the NBA Finals.

The company was founded in Perth in 2013 by Melanie Perkins, Cliff Orbrecht and Cameron Adams. Bursting into a Hamilton-esque hip hop performance, a male rapper told the crowd of all that Canva had to offer. \"You can redesign your work, Canva got that glow-up, we redesign everything from the floor up,\" he sang. In the two minutes and 20 seconds show, a woman playing the part of a sceptical enterprise CIO joined the beige-clad dancers on stage. She raised some doubts about Canva's ability to meet the \"demands of a global machine\" and \"integrate all of our systems easily\". Canva's rapper sang of automated licensing and compliancy, system integration, tailored APIs, and artificial intelligence training. Eventually convinced, the 'CIO' rapped about how \"much we love Canva 'till the end\". \"You've opened my eyes to Canva Enterprise,\" she said. is a newly launched subscription software aimed at large organisations. The musical display has been ruthlessly mocked by social media users on X, formerly Twitter. American comedian Gianmarco Soresi said \"This is Lin Manuel Miranda's fault\", while another user said \"this is why Australian companies should stop hiring Americans\". \"Feels like one of those stage performances to [sic] for kids to warn them of the dangers of drugs,\" one X user said. Another user posted that while the performance was cringey, they would still use Canva. \"Omg, I'd have to step out, I couldn't sit through that,\" another commented.

        "content": "THE constant rumble of traffic is what brings many cities to life. And as the summer months roll in, the hustle and bustle of your neighbourhood is likely to drift in through your windows, flung open to cool your home. 7 Prof Clark reveals exactly what loud noises could be doing to your body Credit: Getty But research suggests the sounds that come could be making you sick. Noise pollution has been linked with life-threatening conditions including cardiovascular problems, type 2 diabetes and dementia. Charlotte Clark, professor of epidemiology at St George’s University of London tells Sun Health: “Many of us don’t think of noise as being damaging but it has a huge impact on the health of the ­population. “In the UK, it is estimated that 9.5million people are regularly exposed to harmful levels of road noise, 1.2million for railways and one million for aircraft noise. “This is estimated to cause 6,000 new cases of heart disease a year and 1,000 premature deaths. And it’s likely these are underestimates as we are starting to see health affected at lower levels of noise.” Many studies link poor health and noise pollution back to sleep disturbance. Prof Clark says: “Your ears keep listening even when you are asleep and if there is a loud noise, it might wake you up or you might shift towards less restorative sleep . “This means you get less deep sleep, which is not good for your health and is linked with many health issues including heart disease, obesity and mental health issues.” Most read in Health BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate Here, Prof Clark reveals exactly what loud noises could be doing to your body. LISTEN UP! ONE in five or 12 million adults in the UK are deaf, have hearing loss or tinnitus. 7 Exposure to loud noise is the second biggest cause of hearing loss Credit: Getty HSE issue warning of heart attack symptoms For 1.2 million of them, the hearing loss is so severe they would not be able to hear most conversational speech. Exposure to loud noise is the second biggest cause of hearing loss after ageing and you might not even notice the effects until years after you were first exposed. Prof Clark says: “Damage occurs throughout your life. “And it’s possible your hearing may be damaged by just one single event of loud noise.” AT THE HEART OF IT HEART disease is a major cause of death in the UK and worldwide, and noise pollution could be an underlying driver. 7 Noise can raise stress levels, which affects the heart Credit: Getty Scientists at Imperial College London found people living near Heath­row were more likely to be admitted to hospital for heart issues. It’s thought noise — even during the night — can raise stress levels, which affects the heart. Prof Clark explains: “If something noisy happens when you are asleep, there are changes in blood pressure and your heart rate goes up. “For someone who lives by a busy road for 10 to 20 years, the impact may be severe.” BRAIN GAME IN 2021, a Danish study published in medical journal The BMJ found that people exposed to loud traffic noise had a 27 per cent higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. 7 People exposed to loud traffic noise have a 27 per cent higher risk of Alzheimer’s Credit: Getty Prof Clark says: “Loud noise narrows the blood vessels to the brain which we know is a risk factor for dementia. “We are also starting to hypothesise whether noise may also cause inflammation in the body and lead to oxidative stress, which are also risk factors for dementia.” Hearing loss is also linked with dementia. SILENT KILLER STUDIES suggest noise pollution may also be involved with the develop­ment of type 2 diabetes, the main causes of which include, being overweight, age and ethnicity. 7 Studies suggest noise pollution may also be involved with the develop­ment of diabetes Credit: Getty A review of research in 2015 said people exposed to more than 60 decibels had a 22 per cent higher risk of type 2 diabetes. A Government study in 2023 said 40 per cent of adults in England were exposed to road traffic noise over 50dBs. Mice studies have also found chronic noise exposure can lead to insulin resistance, a precursor or cause of type 2 diabetes. FAT CHANCE CONSTANT exposure to loud noise isn’t good for your waistline either. 7 Exposure to loud noise isn’t good for your waistline Credit: Getty A joint University of Oxford and University of Leicester study found a link between those living in high traffic-noise areas and obesity . People living near a busy road or motorway were more likely to have a larger waist circumference and higher BMI. Prof Clark says: “Unwanted noise can affect quality of life and disturb sleep. “It may increase stress levels and this in turn can lead to weight gain.” Sleep deprivation has been shown to increase the number of calories a person eats the next day. MENTAL HEALTH UNWANTED noise can also increase the risk of mental health problems. 7 Noise can also increase the risk of mental health problems Credit: Getty A 2019 review of ten studies found four per cent higher odds of depression and 12 per cent of anxiety per 10dB increase in road traffic noise. Prof Clark says: “We know that exposure to aircraft, road and railway noise is associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. “Sometimes someone may find a noise particularly disturbing. “If you feel annoyed by a noise, that is a stress response and your body starts to release stress hormones. These lead to poor mental health.” JUST HOW LOUD IS TOO NOISY? WHILE we can’t always control the noise around us, we can take steps to prevent it doing us harm. Experts generally agree that damage starts to occur at sounds of 85dB – that’s decibels – and above, over an eight-hour period. That level of noise is the equivalent of a ringing phone or a food processor in action. Franki Oliver, audiology manager for RNID, the national hearing loss charity, says: “By the time you get to 100dB – which is very common in many live music venues or nightclubs – the exposure time before damage may occur is only 15 minutes. “In a real-life situation, you should be able to talk to someone who is two metres away without having to shout over background noise. “If you can’t be heard, the noise level may be hazardous. “If you spend a lot of time in these environments, take regular breaks away from the din, such as five minutes every hour.

        "description": "While a dividend cut is bad news for existing investors, it may present a good buying opportunity for new investors.The post Innergex Cut its Dividend: Is the Stock Still a Buy? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Cutting or suspending dividends, even when it’s necessary, is rarely well-received by investors. The existing investors of a business that cuts its dividends experience a reduction in their dividend-based income. A drop in the company valuation also accompanies it because an exodus of investors often follows dividend cuts. In extreme cases, the sell-out frenzy may reduce the company’s valuation to a fraction of its former self. However, most of this pertains to the existing investor base, and new investors may perceive a company that recently cut its dividends a bit differently. One such company is ( ), and it might be worth looking into. The dividend cut, reasons, and reaction Earlier this year, Innergex announced it would cut its dividends by half. It paid about $0.18 by the end of 2023, and starting in 2024, the company is only paying about $0.09 per share. One main reason behind the dividend cut was that they were becoming unsustainable, owing to the company’s weak finances. In some quarters, they ate up the company’s free cash flow, forcing it to rely on external financial assistance for its projects. The reaction to the dividend cut hasn’t been as aggressive as the reaction many other companies have seen. The stock has dropped less than 3% into the year so far, and the most significant drop happened in February when the stock slumped 24% in 20 days. Overall, the phase has been minimal. Is Innergex still a buy? For people who don’t already have Innergex in their portfolio, the stock may be worth considering for several reasons. Despite the dividend cut, the stock comes with a healthy enough yield of about 4%, and if the company gets back on its feet (financially), it may try to restore its dividends to their original level. This means you may experience rapid dividend growth in the next few years. Another reason is that the company might improve its debt profile by funding most of its operations and growth from the now freed-up free cash flow. The third reason is its resilience. It’s one thing for a stock to retain its market value when the market or the sector dips (external hostile forces). However, retaining its value, despite cutting its payouts is resilience on another level. Foolish takeaway One thing to remember about the stock is that it has been in perpetual decline since its peak in Jan. 2021 and is currently trading at a discount of about 71% from that peak value. The dividend cut is more likely to prolong this slump. So, if you are anticipating quick capital appreciation, this may disappoint you.",

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.”",

But every would be candidate it can at this time intimate to the public is desire for public office by conducting caucuses. It cannot be considered a violation at this time because the law says that it is not yet the campaign period, ergo there is no violation. There are now big billboards of senatorial candidates like that of Imee Marcos, Francis Tolentino and Camille Villar on strategic area along the highways. ( I made a road trip last March in Laguna, Batangas and Cavite during the Holy Week and the highways are dotted with tarpaulins wishing or advising motorists to have safe travels). Well, possibly most them believe that ‘early bird catches the worm’. There are always combinations in life and in any human pursuit. Presidential candidates have someone on the back ride as they should ride in tandem. The most successful was that of Bongbong Marcos and Inday Sara Duterte. They represented Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Bongbong’s dad was from the Ilocos, a part of Luzon and the mother is from Leyte in the Visayas . Inday Sara is from Mindanao. The mayors have their vice mayors, and in Angeles City Congressman Jonjon Lazatin will have Vicky Vega Cabigting as running mate. It is a perfect match up. Both are successful in their runs in many recent elections. Lazatin hurdled with ease three congressional elections and Cabigting is always a winner in the vice mayoral race in the city. Dopesters are placing their bets that the Lazatin-Cabigting team including their ten council bets will likely to make a sweep. In a big city like Angeles where there are more than 200 thousand registered voters, the votes are mostly cast on known surnames. Seven re-electionists are in the LV ticket, namely Atty. Pogs Suller, Edu Pamintuan, Alex Indiongco, Raco Del Rosario, Niknok Banola, JC Aguas and Chris Cortez. Alfred Sangil will have the familiar family name of his cousin Jay Sangil and Mich Bonifacio will take the place of her husband Alfie. Aron Pineda has made an almost successful run last elections and his name is already known far and wide. Politics involves marketing. Just like commodities there should be name recall. Just like when someone is buying a toothpaste, Colgate will always come to mind.",

Respect the pizza.” Massimiliano Martolini fumed: “This is a joke not pizza!” And Marco Pennelli couldn’t give a thumbs up, adding: “It’s not a good sign when the underside is black, it’s burnt. “Come to Bari and we’ll teach you some tricks. Anyway we appreciate the attempt!” Another reckoned: “You are one of the best chefs but this was painful to watch mate!” And one insisted: “You lost me with the beans bro.” Ramsay also included Welsh seaweed and cheese as he made pizza in Portmeirion for his Scrambled series.",

This is the story of that transformation. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} At the beginning of the 21st century, coal was the dominant energy source for electricity generation in the United States. In 2000, coal consumption stood at 22.6 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs), reflecting its widespread use in power plants across the country. This was primarily a reflection of coal’s relatively low cost and abundance in the U.S. Natural gas consumption was also substantial at 23.3 quadrillion BTUs, but it was primarily used for heating and industrial processes. However, it would soon be a rapidly growing fuel for electricity generation. Renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and biomass, contributed a modest 5.7 quadrillion BTUs. The mid-2000s saw a notable increase in natural gas consumption, driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques that unlocked vast reserves of shale gas. By 2005, natural gas consumption stood at 22.7 quadrillion BTUs, but it was on the verge of breaking out. Coal consumption remained relatively stable, peaking slightly in the mid-2000s before beginning a gradual decline. Renewables started to gain traction, largely due to increased investments in wind and solar energy. The late 2000s and early 2010s marked a significant shift towards cleaner energy sources. This period saw a rapid decline in coal consumption, dropping to 20.8 quadrillion BTUs by 2010, as environmental regulations tightened, and the economic advantages of natural gas became more apparent. Coal Natural Gas Renewables 2000 to 2023. Data Source: EIA. ROBERT RAPIER Natural gas consumption reached 24.7 quadrillion BTUs in 2010, benefiting from its lower carbon emissions and cost-effectiveness. Renewable energy continued its upward trajectory, reaching 7.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2010, spurred by federal and state incentives, technological advancements, and decreasing costs. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The trend towards cleaner energy sources accelerated in the mid-2010s. By 2015, coal consumption had fallen sharply to 15.7 quadrillion BTUs, while natural gas consumption continued to climb, reaching 28.3 quadrillion BTUs. Renewables saw significant growth, with consumption rising to 10.0 quadrillion BTUs, driven by substantial increases in wind and solar power capacity. The late 2010s to early 2020s solidified the dominance of natural gas and renewables in the U.S. energy mix. By 2020, coal consumption had plummeted to 10.7 quadrillion BTUs, reflecting the ongoing decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and a shift towards cleaner energy. Natural gas consumption reached 32.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2020. Natural gas played a role both as firm power (power on demand), in addition to a role in balancing intermittent renewable energy sources. Renewables saw remarkable growth, with consumption reaching 12.1 quadrillion BTUs in 2020, highlighting the significant contributions of wind, solar, and biomass energy. In 2023, coal consumption bounced back a bit, while natural gas consumption grew to a record 36.5 quadrillion BTUs. Renewable energy consumption reached a record 14.7 quadrillion BTUs in 2023, reflecting ongoing investments in renewable energy infrastructure and the increasing role of wind and solar power in the national energy grid. The period from 2000 to 2023 has seen a dramatic transformation in the U.S. energy landscape. Coal consumption declined by 13.0 quadrillion BTUs, while natural gas consumption increased by 13.4 quadrillion BTUs. Renewable consumption increased by 8.4 quadrillion BTUs over that period. ADVERTISEMENT However, it should be noted that these comparisons are not apples-to-apples. When coal or natural gas are burned for power, most of the energy (60% to 70%) is lost in the conversion to electricity as heat. However, that is not the case for renewables. Thus, it can be said that a BTU of coal or natural gas consumption is not directly comparable to a BTU of renewable energy consumption when electricity is the measure being discussed. On the other hand, renewable energy is not firm power. Natural gas can be used to completely replace a coal-fired power plant. Renewables are better suited to serve marginal demand in a decentralized fashion. As a result, renewables and natural gas have worked well together to cause the massive decline in coal consumption this century. These trends are expected to continue as technological advancements, economic factors, and policy initiatives drive further efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The U.S. energy sector is poised for a future where renewables play a central role, supported by natural gas as a flexible and reliable energy source.

        "content": "Two men are accused of beating a Pierce County convenience store owner after he asked them not to harass a female customer, leaving him with a broken rib and facial fractures that required surgery, court records show. On Friday, prosecutors charged the men, one 37 and one 33, with first-degree assault, first-degree robbery and third-degree malicious mischief. Pleas of not guilty were entered on the 37-year-old man’s behalf at arraignment in Pierce County Superior Court. Court Commissioner Barbara McInvaille ordered him jailed in lieu of $250,000 bail. An arrest warrant was issued for the other man but revoked the same day. It is unclear from court records if he has been arrested. The incident occurred March 12 about 4 p.m. at Johnson’s Corner Grocery & Grill, 30401 Mountain Highway E. in Graham. Charging documents give this account: The men walked into the store and allegedly harassed a female customer who was leaving. The 68-year-old business owner asked them not to do that. The men then brought a gallon water jug to the counter, and the owner told them he’d let them have it at no charge if they’d leave. One then grabbed an energy drink and asked, “What about this?”, records show. The owner took the energy drink from the counter and asked them again to leave. That’s when one of the men punched him, sparking a beating from both men, one of whom threw the water jug at him, striking him in the head. “They both then started punching him, breaking his rib while doing so,” records show. “When asked about his injuries, the victim said he had a broken rib, broken nose, and broken cheek bone. He said his vision is blurred and he still can’t breathe out of his right nostril. He said that he underwent facial surgery at Harborview.” At one point, the owner grabbed a golf club to try to defend his wife and himself and got in a shot, hitting one of the men in the arm. The other ran behind the counter, records show, and “put the victim in a headlock with his left arm. He then punched the victim in his face with his right fist multiple times.” The men then grabbed the water jug and the energy drink and started to leave, but they walked back to the front door where they both punched the owner again and smashed his phone on the ground before getting into a pickup. “Both defendants fled the area, leaving the victim bleeding on the ground outside the front door,” records show. A detective said he tried to contact the victim in April but was advised by his daughter that the man “had several bone fractures in his face and could not speak,” records show. It was early May before he could give an interview, the records say. Detectives used the truck’s registration, video surveillance and other evidence to identify the suspects. They arrested the 37-year-old man at his home in Spanaway without incident, court records show.",

        "description": "There are so many media covering the game that the dry and predictable press conference quotes with no personality actually provide little interest.",
        "content": "There has been no hotter AFL property than Luke Beveridge in terms of media interest this season – with the exception of probably Harley Reid. There have been countless articles, radio segments, television discussions, interviews and podcast rants about whether he is the right man to lead the Western Bulldogs. But when he walked into his post-match press conference after the loss to the Sydney Swans, it was a lonely experience. Only one journalist was there, so he must have been surprised at the sudden loss of interest in him. More AFL It wasn’t like there was nothing to ask about; pushing the ladder leaders and current flag favourites to within 14 points and playing some good football at stages. There were individual performances that could have been commented on, general improvements, game strategy and even an injury update on Aaron Naughton. It has been reported that the Swans opened their dressing rooms up while Bevo was due at the press conference, and reporters had to choose one or the other. Therefore, it wasn’t a matter of disrespecting the Bulldogs coach by not attending, it was just that journalists at the ground could probably do their job better and get more content by seeking individual player interviews – and then watching the recorded press conference online through the club’s social media channels later. What looked awkward was when virtually all the media chose the same path – as Beveridge made a point to thank the one journalist who attended. He sustained the ‘press conference’ for over eight minutes. Firstly, I think the scheduling clash needs to be investigated and measures put in place to ensure there is no clash for media wanting to attend both. But more importantly, it raises another issue – do press conferences provide any actual value in terms of the content they actually provide for supporters? Or is it a mere formality with AFL ticking a box to say they are transparent with the public, and journalists asking questions for their own sake? The fans are the ones who the press conferences are meant to be for, not the reporters – the media will report on whatever is said, no matter how bleak the substance. Just 24 hours later came one of the season’s most controversial on-field moments, Fremantle coming back to draw after the umpire paid a dubious ‘delay of game’ free kick against Collingwood. If ever fans would have wanted to hear honest opinions and comments from a coach, it would have been Craig McRae, but all he provided was: “I’m looking forward to what the AFL tell us about that because I wasn’t aware that was a free kick. But maybe it clearly is because they don’t pay things that aren’t there. I’m looking forward to seeing what they say. It will be what it will be. It doesn’t help us, does it?” That quote tells you nothing. No emotion, nor anything that showed any human feeling towards a huge moment in the game that engrossed a large number of fans, especially because it was potentially game-deciding on the primetime stage of Friday Night Football. The Pies coach did what he had to do. By the terms of his contract, he’s not allowed to say anything that would bring the game into disrepute and give fans ammunition to vent anger at the AFL, its image and its sponsors. So it’s better to say nothing. It does little to sweep the incident under the carpet, given the TV commentary shows and social media soon after the game were scathing at umpire Mathew Nicholls, and fans were still outraged and debating it the next day. \"That is where common sense absolutely needs to come into it. That changed the game.\" #ArmchairExperts pic.twitter.com/A0eTRe6mdN A few weeks earlier, Chris Scott quite intelligently and constructively broke down problems he saw with the holding-the-ball rules and the interpretations, in what some labelled a five-minute rant. He then had to meet with the AFL later in the week to ‘clear the air’, even though the official line was the meeting was routine. But how are coaches meant to honestly tell fans their concerns for the path the game is heading in, if they are just going to be silenced and labelled as ‘whingers’? In the Carlton-Gold Coast game, both coaches had a shot at the officiating, without really having a shot at the officiating – if you get what I mean. A frustrated Michael Voss said: “So we’ve got a couple of things to follow up just to make sure we have clarity as well that we’re seeing it the same way. I don’t sit up here and ever do that because I feel like most of it’s all in our control, and I still firmly believe that, but also it’s our responsibility to get clarity when we’re unsure. And we’re unsure so we’ll get the clarity. We’ll do the right channels as well because this isn’t about just focusing on that (bad calls and non-calls that stood out), it’s about taking our time, have a look through the vision, let’s be really clear and we’ve always had really good discussions so I can’t see that changing. We’ll just probably seek a little bit more feedback this week than what we normally have.” That’s him trying to say “the umpires dudded us today”, but instead, it came across as 20-30 seconds of ambiguous, fence-sitting drivel – to avoid sanction, and in the hope enough people read between the lines. Some wouldn’t have watched the game closely, and don’t scoff, there are a lot of people who only consume the game through highlights, live scores, social media posts or flicking between TV channels, particularly when the AFL schedules two games at the same time. They wouldn’t know exactly what the Carlton coach was referring to – so how does it help anything? Part of being a top-level coach is knowing how to phrase controversial remarks, even though many take a Sergeant Schultz approach, or sound like they are attending a Royal Commission: “I know nothing” – or I didn’t see it. So, again, what do fans actually get out of these 10-minute stage-managed experiences, given coaches are effectively censored with the threat of fines from revealing what they really think? (Photo by Michael Dodge/Getty Images) It’s not like the fans don’t have a choice either. In the early days, press conferences were the main, and sometimes only, way players and coaches spoke to their fans. But, in the modern day, there’s so much media covering the game, including independent podcasts, that the dry and predictable press conference grabs with no personality actually provide little interest. The AFL, along with other sports, have taken an approach where their brand image is more important than the integrity of the competition. Therefore, it’s more important to silence an aggressive coach after a controversial loss than to actually fix problems that the coaches, who are actually smart minds in the game, raise. The press conferences are a part of trying to get controlled content into the 24-hour media cycle. Sports opinion delivered daily In addition, the mainstream media coverage of the game is more concentrated than ever, and finding that point of difference in a one-on-one exclusive interview is more important than the choreographed press conference. Even the game’s biggest “news breakers” like Tom Morris, Mark Robinson and Caroline Wilson barely attend press conferences because they get their stories from other sources, and they know the AFL-sanctioned events won’t be much help given the tight leash the governing body and the clubs hold. This year the AFL expanded the access to players in the rooms, meaning that all players named in the 23 must be available for post-match interviews with media following each game. If that’s the case, journalists are going to choose that every day to get their content – and AFL coaches talking to an empty room or a single AFL staffer may become a more common experience.",

RELATED CONTENT: Stanford beats UCLA to capture 3rd NCAA women’s golf title CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) — Kelly Xu went undefeated in match play for the second straight year and the rest of Stanford followed her lead Wednesday, beating UCLA in the title match for its second NCAA championship in the three years. Rachel Heck delivered the final point in a 3-2 victory and the celebration was on for Stanford, the No. 1 team and the top seed going into match play. “We never take anything for granted,” Stanford coach Anne Walker said. “We’re privileged to be in this position. We talk a lot about staying patient, staying grateful and enjoying the moment. These are so hard to win.” Heck seized control early in the anchor match by going 3 up through four holes. Megha Ganne took over in her match around the turn on the North course at La Costa. UCLA’s Zoe Campos and Caroline Canales stayed ahead in their matches. It looked for a moment as though the all-Pac-12 final would come down to Xu. She was 4 up until Meghan Royal won two straight holes to cut the deficit in half through 11 holes, with momentum on her side. And then it all came undone. Royal drove left into grass so thick she couldn’t get it back out to the second cut of rough, eventually conceding the 14th hole. On the 15th, Xu’s shot bounced through the firm green, over the back and down a steep slope into the water. Royal was just over 100 yards out and her shot also went over the back, down the hill and into the hazard. Xu looked as though she would leave the 15th with a 2-up lead. She wound up winning, 4 and 3, and then the title came into clear view for the Cardinal. Ganne closed out a 3-and-2 victory when Natalie Vo went from a front bunker to a plugged lie in a back bunker on the par-3 16th. Heck gave Stanford the third and final point it needed when she made par on the 15th and Kate Villegas couldn’t extend the match. “Stanford started off hot. We just got behind the 8-ball too quick,” UCLA coach Alicia Um Holmes said. “You try not to make it about results but it hurts to lose when you work so hard and put so many hours in.” Campos, who won four times this year, closed out Sadie Englemann of Stanford, 4 and 3. Canales chipped in for eagle for a 2-up win over Paula Martin Sampedro in the lead match, which ended right as Heck was delivering the clinching point. Stanford now has three NCAA titles in women’s golf since it went to match play in 2015. UCLA also has three title, all in stroke play, the most recent in 2011.

        "description": "Memorial Day service at the Korean War Memorial in Graceland/Fairlawn Cemetery on Monday honored those who gave their lives in the service of their country.",
        "content": "DECATUR — During the Gettysburg Address, President Abraham Lincoln referred to those who died in service to their country as “these honored dead” and described their sacrifice as “the last full measure of devotion.” Speaker Gregory Sullivan, a U.S. Navy veteran, quoted that speech during his remarks on Monday at the Korean War Memorial in Graceland/Fairlawn Cemetery during the combined ceremony with the Veterans Assistance Commission of Macon County. Organizers opted to hold one joint ceremony this year. “We gather, not merely to enjoy a long weekend or the onset of summer, but to honor and remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country,” Sullivan said. “Memorial Day is a solemn occasion, a time to reflect on the valor, courage and sacrifice of the 1.3 million men and women who have given their lives in service to our nation. For more than two centuries, Americans have answered the call of duty, bravely defending the ideas upon which our nation was founded. From the fields of Gettysburg, to the beaches of Normandy, to the jungles of Vietnam, to the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan, our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have fought and died to preserve freedom and to protect our way of life.” Those who attended were greeted by Boy Scouts and adult troop leaders, given a program and a lapel pin marking the occasion. Graceland Cemetery once again hosted its Avenue of Flags. The flags were donated or purchased by local veterans’ families to be displayed. Along with the flag, a metal dog tag is engraved with the veteran’s name, year of birth and death, and the military branch and is attached to the pole. Volunteers spent Sunday night in the cemetery to guard the flags to prevent their being stolen. Sullivan asked family members who had lost someone in war to raise their hands, and raised his own hand. He thanked them for their sacrifice, too, as they wake up every day without a loved one's presence. “We also remember the families of the fallen who have borne the burden of their loved ones' sacrifice,” he said. “We must never forget what they did on behalf of our nation. We thank you. You taught them how to do that, how to serve their country on behalf of others.” Names of those who died in the Korean War were read during the service, followed by the laying of wreaths by veterans' organizations and Gold Star Mothers. Boy Scouts lined up along the front of the memorial to receive and salute the wreaths, and to hold them steady in the brisk breeze so they wouldn't fall over. During the benediction, Gary Bauerle, Macon County Honor Guard chaplain, prayed for blessings on the families left behind. Ray Ewing of Warrensburg, who served 24 years in the U.S. Air Force, is a regular attendee at Memorial Day services, he said. “We've got to remember the people who gave their lives for us,” he said. “It's our history,” said Shelba Donoho of Decatur. “We should never forget our history and how we got to where we are today.”",

Pep Guardiola's men made history earlier this month by becoming the first team to win a fourth straight title. After holding off an intense challenge from Arsenal, City were crowned champions of England for a sixth time in seven years in an era of dominance. For many, the achievements are marked with an asterisk with , although the club strongly deny any wrongdoing. However, Guardiola's work at the Etihad Stadium shouldn't be overlooked, according to . Prior to his final game in charge of Liverpool, the German insisted that Guardiola's achievement in Manchester shouldn't be impacted by the outcome of the charges. \"Everybody knows about the 115 charges, but I have no clue what that means. I only know the number,\" he said the media, via \"No matter what has transpired at Manchester City, Pep Guardiola is the best manager in the world - and that is truly significant. If you put any other manager in that club, they don't win the league four times in a row. That's down to him and his team. \"Does that mean they can do whatever they want? No. But I don't know what they did - if they did anything - and I'm not here to say they have. We will see. Of course, I would like to know (if City are guilty) one day. Everyone wants to know. But I will be somewhere else. \"The quality of Pep makes the difference so I don't worry about these things. We will see. It's not my problem and I am fine with what we have and what we've achieved.\" Arsenal sporting director, Edu Gaspar, has now seconded Klopp's that sentiment. Speaking to Brazilian outlet , he said: \"There are things that unfortunately I cannot say what I feel. But all the credit in the world to Pep for the training and work he's been doing since he started his career. \"I even joke with my son that I want to see if he's really good at rugby. It's a joke I make because he's already won everything in football.\"",

        "content": "CAT owners should stop saying “Here, puss” to moggies because it is “like swearing at them”. A pet charity says words with “s” in them sound like aggressive hissing. PDSA vet nurse Gemma Renwick added: “ Cats pick up on certain sounds and tend to prefer fewer ‘s’ sounds. The ‘s’ noise is similar to a cat hissing, which is almost like swearing at them every time you want their attention. “Consider speaking their language and meowing at them. “Unlike hissing, adult cats don’t really meow at one another, but do use meows to communicate with us humans.” Gemma warned feline fans of several moggie mistakes ahead of next Tuesday’s annual #HugYourCatDay — including cuddles. She said: “Hugging, and other approaches we may consider signs of affection, can actually be detrimental. “If a cat runs away as you come towards them or they dash off as soon as you let go, it’s a good sign they don’t want to be touched or have their personal space invaded. “Always let your cat come to you and you’ll reap the rewards of consensual kitty cuddles.” Gemma added that making eye contact was “quite threatening” and advised we instead copy cats’ “slow blink”. And playing with laser pointers leaves empty-pawed cats frustrated. Gemma also warned against using citrus-smelling cleaning products on litter trays which “could actually put them off using it”.",

With its latest dashboard enhancements, BlockDAG has significantly improved user interactions, elevating standards in cryptocurrency engagement. Bolstered by pioneering innovations and an ambitious price forecast of $30 by 2030, BlockDAG continues to draw keen interest and investment from the crypto community. BNB’s price momentum is strong, having broken through the significant $595 barrier, a price point that had been resistant since March. Currently priced at $623, BNB’s ascent reflects a vibrant purchasing trend, moving beyond the constraints of a previously observed symmetrical triangle pattern, where prices fluctuated between higher lows and lower highs, indicative of market consolidation. This breakthrough has propelled BNB above both its 20-day Exponential Moving Average and 50-day Simple Moving Average, suggesting a clear upward trajectory. This shift in momentum highlights a significant market move towards further coin accumulation. In the realm of digital payments, Litecoin remains a frontrunner, consistently leading in transaction volume on the BitPay platform for five consecutive months. Its dominance is so pronounced that it surpasses the transaction volumes of the next three cryptocurrencies combined, emphasizing its widespread use in digital transactions. The recent weeks have seen substantial investments in Litecoin, including a noteworthy purchase of 900,000 LTC on May 10th. These large transactions, totaling $230 million, demonstrate increasing institutional interest in Litecoin, cementing its status as a vital player in the crypto market. BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in the cryptocurrency presale arena, amassing an impressive $34 million. This surge in interest is largely due to its recent updates, particularly the dashboard revamp which has significantly improved user interaction and transparency on the platform. Furthermore, the updated dashboard introduces new features designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. It includes a ‘hot news’ section, which immediately updates users with the latest developments upon logging in, ensuring they are always informed. Additionally, the wallet feature now shows updated balances promptly after any purchase of miners or coins, enhancing user trust and convenience. A newly introduced leaderboard showcases the top 30 investors, highlighting the major players and promoting a competitive investment environment. This feature not only adds a gamification element to investing but also signals potential rewards for top investors, further engaging the community. With these strategic enhancements, BlockDAG not only solidifies its position in the market but also sets the stage for sustained future growth. Market analysts are keeping a keen eye on this trend, with projections pointing to a long-term target price of $30 by 2030. To recap, With BNB breaking through major resistance levels and Litecoin maintaining its lead in digital payments, BlockDAG stands out as the top investment choice. Renowned for its record-breaking $34 million presale, BlockDAG not only improves user interactions with its redesigned dashboard but also offers significant growth prospects. Its strategic enhancements and an ambitious $30 price target by 2030 make this the optimal moment to invest in BlockDAG, positioning it as a premier investment opportunity in the crypto landscape.

        "content": "Claretian Communications Foundation, Inc. 8TH WEEK IN ORDINARY TIME Psalter: Week 4 / (Green) Responsorial Psalm: Ps 98: 1, 2-3ab, 3cd-4: The Lord has made known his salvation. 1st Reading: 1 Peter 1: 10-16 This was the salvation for which the prophets so eagerly looked when, in days past, they foretold the favor of God, with regard to you. But they could only investigate when, the Spirit of Christ present within them, pointed out the time and the circumstances, of this — the sufferings of Christ, and the glories which would follow. It was revealed to them that they were working, not for themselves, but for you. Thus, in these days, after the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, the gospel’s preachers have taught you these mysteries, which even the angels long to see. So, then, let your spirit be ready. Be alert, with confident trust, in the grace you will receive, when Jesus Christ appears. Like obedient children, do not return to your former life, given over to ignorance and passions. Imitate the one who called you. As he is holy, so you, too, be holy, in all your conduct, since Scripture says: Be holy for I am holy. Gospel: Mark 10: 28-31 Peter spoke up and said, “We have given up everything to follow you.” Jesus answered, “Truly, there is no one who has left house, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel, who will not receive his reward. I say to you: even in the midst of persecution, he will receive a hundred times as many houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands in the present time; and, in the world to come, eternal life. Do pay attention: many who now are the first will be last, and the last, first.” REFLECTION: “Evangelical Poverty.” There is such thing as evangelical poverty, which is an option made by an individual who has decided to leave everything behind for the sake of the Gospel. Such a person who opted to be poor for the sake of the Gospel becomes a living witness to God’s divine providence. Once free from the attachment to material things, the relationship with God who always provides, deepens. Today’s Gospel is the continuation of the passage we reflected on yesterday. The disciples were puzzled about the words of Jesus because Jesus told them of the difficulty of the rich to enter into the kingdom of God. People in Jesus’ time thought of the poor as accursed. Consequently, if the rich had difficulty entering eternal life, it would even be more difficult for the poor to be saved. But Jesus told them that all things are possible with God. Hence, when we surrender everything to God, he will surely provide for us. We have to seek God’s kingdom first and his righteousness and everything will be given to us (cf. Mt. 6:33). Once a person opts for evangelical poverty, putting God first ahead of anything, every situation becomes an occasion of divine providence.

        "content": "CITY OF SAN FERNANDO —The Provincial Government of Pampanga has set the monthly cash assistance to daycare teachers in Pampanga from P2,500 to P3,000. Governor Dennis Pineda led the turnover of assistance to 689 daycare teachers at the Bren Z. Guiao Convention Center recently. Lubao Mayor Esmie Pineda and Provincial Social Welfare and Development Officer Fe Manarang assisted the governor during the event. Republic Act No. 10410 or the Early Years Act (EYA) of 2013 states that daycare workers “are directly responsible for the care and education of young children from age zero to four years.” Despite this, many workers still do not enjoy the benefits of regular employees. In 2018, the PSWDO said that “from 2015 to 2017, only 56 or 8.56 percent of daycare workers in the province have permanent plantilla positions. Some 29 of them or 4.43 percent have casual positions. The remaining 569 or 87 percent are non-plantilla – either they are working on a job order status or are volunteers.” The provincial government of Pampanga has been providing a monthly subsidy to the workers since 2016 through Ordinance No696 which started at the amount of then P1,500. The children of daycare workers also received educational assistance, free medical services, and hospitalization at the district and provincial hospitals.",

So, when summer’s siren call beckoned, the GOAT answered in resounding fashion – by diving headfirst into a well-deserved stint of quality family time. In a recent Instagram reel set to the upbeat rhythm of Post Malone’s “ I Need Some Help ,” Brady treated fans to an envy-inducing glimpse of how the Brady clan kicks off their summer escapades. With his kids Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian in tow, the football legend traded in playbooks for playtime, dipping himself in a whirlwind of water adventures. The visuals were straight out of a seaside daydream – Brady carving waves on a surfboard, lounging with his brood aboard a luxurious yacht, and leaving a frothy wake in his path as he masterfully maneuvered jet skis across glistening waters. Tom Brady gave his fans an open invitation to catch sight of the merrymaking, if only vicariously. Captioning the reel with a playful: And merrymaking they did, with the comment section burst in a chorus of jovial banter and well-wishes. “ Dam the roast forced you to spend quality time Tom ,” one cheeky fan quipped. Others also reveled in the sight of the retired legend, with comments like “ Bro is enjoying retirement ” and “ That’s how you start summer !” This break seems like exactly what Tom Brady needed before diving back into his commitments with FOX Sports and navigating the complexities of his Las Vegas Raiders ownership stakes . Plus, after the jokes from his Netflix special roast, a bit of cooling off in the water could not hurt. For now, this seaside sojourn may prove to be the rejuvenating tonic that keeps the GOAT going strong. FOX Reporter Is Confident On Tom Brady Having A Successful Broadcasting Career Tom Brady’s FOX broadcasting debut is shaping up to be must-see TV. Just ask FOX’s lead reporter, Erin Andrews. The veteran reporter can’t contain her excitement over Brady’s potential. In a recent appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show, Andrews raved about the GOAT’s storytelling ability. Andrews knows greatness when she sees it. If Brady conquers something, it’s no surprise as his track record is impeccable. Tom Brady himself is giddy about delivering a unique TV experience. Moreover, the fans will be getting a couple of perspectives they always craved. However, Brady also knows that the broadcasting booth won’t be a breeze and he ready to work.

        "description": "Once again, Ronald Acuna Jr will miss time for the Braves with an ACL tear. Who could help replace the reigning NL MVP?",
        "content": "When . blew out his right knee on July 10, 2021, Alex Anthopoulos felt compelled to respond quickly. The Braves' head of baseball operations wanted to send a message to the Atlanta players that the season was not lost -- that the front office and the team should continue to fight. So five days later, Anthopoulos traded for veteran outfielder and catcher , and before the end of the summer, he'd add three more outfielders -- , and . The Braves would go on to win the World Series that fall, with those midseason additions contributing significantly. Now Acuna injury, to his other knee, and again he is out for the season. The Braves' situation is not nearly as dire as it was when Acuna was hurt in '21 -- then, Atlanta was struggling to play .500 ball, and didn't have nearly as deep of a roster as it does now. But this time, the team has to move ahead not only without the reigning National League MVP, but also without its most dominant pitcher, Spencer Strider, who suffered a season-ending elbow injury at the outset of the season. The early success (and good health) of has helped to plug the hole created by Strider's injury. But the Braves' offense -- which had already been in an early funk after setting records for home runs last year -- will need heroes to emerge in the lineup. It might be third baseman , who is expected to return soon from a minor back injury suffered a couple of weeks ago. At that point, Riley had felt that he was just about to emerge from an early-season slump. \"I am close,\" said Riley, holding his index and thumb millimeters apart, as he described how he felt at the plate. Maybe it'll be Braves center fielder Michael Harris II, who knows what it means to dig out of a slump. Last year, Harris was activated off the injured list without taking at-bats in the minors because the staff felt his defense was so important -- and for six weeks, he struggled mightily at the plate. But in his last 100 games, Harris batted .335 with 63 runs, 16 home runs and 15 stolen bases. He could be a natural candidate to ascend into the leadoff spot. All-Star catcher , too, after missing most of the past two months with a rib cage injury. First baseman has already begun to work his way out of a slow start, batting .290 with five homers in his past 16 games. Through his April struggles, Olson had actually generated hard-hit rates that were in line with what he produced last year, but he did not have the results to show for it. His teammates felt he had been the victim of some bad BABIP luck. Many pointed to a game against the Red Sox on May 8: Olson scorched a line drive toward left field that Boston third baseman rose to barely spear. Braves hitting coach Kevin Seitzer could see Olson's shoulders sag with frustration at the sight of yet another intercepted line drive. But Devers couldn't hold the ball, and Olson got a hit. Before the next game, Seitzer spoke to Olson about his reaction to Devers' brief interception. When Olson's shoulders dropped, Seitzer said, it was like he could see that misfortune weighing down the All-Star first baseman. Seitzer told Olson there was no sense clinging to that frustration, because those early-season at-bats were behind him, and he couldn't change the result. \"As far as I'm concerned, the season starts for you today,\" Seitzer said. Hours later, after Olson had clubbed a home run in a series-opening win over the Mets, Seitzer greeted Olson in the handshake line and punctuated his earlier remarks: \"Have a great season.\" Maybe the Braves will get a boost from , or , the talented young outfielder who has swung well in his first season with the Braves. Maybe Duvall, signed late in spring training, will take advantage of the additional playing time he will get. Maybe will continue to carry the offense, as he has for a lot of this season. \"He might be the best hitter in baseball right now,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said Sunday as he described a plate appearance that Ozuna had against his team. And it's a certainty that Anthopoulos, reflexively proactive, will scan the trade market and look for opportunities to upgrade, even at a time when his farm system is thinner than that of other contenders. Anthopoulos typically holds some spending flexibility in reserve, and inevitably, other teams will look to dump pricey veterans as they fall out of the race. Sellers will develop, and outfielders will become available. , , , , , Rosario (again) and are among the players on short-term deals who could be moved this year if their respective teams fall out of contention. Braves manager Brian Snitker talked earlier this year about the team's offensive problems and mentioned a trait he sees in the collective mindset of the team. \"These guys will not panic,\" he said. \"They will never panic. Three years ago, we lost Acuna, and these guys just kept going.\" Three years ago, they won the World Series without him. Now the Braves will have to try to do that again.",

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 3:50 p.m. on Monday for strong thunderstorms until 4:45 p.m. for Wyoming, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Erie counties. The storms are expected to bring pea-sized hail (0.25 inches) and wind gusts of up to 40 mph. \"At 3:50 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a cluster of strong thunderstorms 8 miles northeast of Long Point State Park, or 9 miles north of Jamestown, moving northeast at 30 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Springville, Colden, Lakewood, Gowanda, Arcade, Mayville, Clymer, Long Point State Park, Chaffee, Ashford Hollow, Chautauqua Institution, Findley Lake, East Concord, Chautauqua, Concord, Collins, Yorkshire, Holland, Sardinia and Stockton. This includes Interstate 86 between exits 4 and 11. The weather service adds, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. If on or near Chautauqua Lake, get out of the water and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, keep these recommendations in mind: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards: Beware of swollen waterways: Maintain safe driving distances: Slow down and stay cautious: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road.

        "description": "Quishing takes a different approach, exploiting the convenience and ubiquity of QR codes.The post Heard of phishing scams? Now ‘quishing’ is the new scam to watch out for appeared first on Digital Journal.",
        "content": "A new cybercrime threat has emerged, and it has been dubbed “quishing.” Many are familiar with the term “phishing,” which involves scammers attempting to obtain sensitive information through fraudulent emails or websites. Quishing takes a different approach, exploiting the convenience and ubiquity of quick-response (QR) codes. In recent months, quishing has risen from making up a mere 0.8 percent of all email phishing attacks in 2021, to accounting for a staggering 11 percent so far into 2024. Trevor Cooke, Privacy Expert at EarthWeb has told Digital Journal that: “Quishing is a relatively unknown but rapidly growing problem that preys on our trust in QR codes and our reliance on mobile devices.” As QR codes have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of our lives, from contactless payments to accessing information, cybercriminals have found a new avenue to exploit. The data on the rise of quishing was sourced from Intelligent CIO. The data on quishing incidents in June to August 2023 and the scam threat in 2024 came from Keepnet . What is Quishing? Quishing, a portmanteau of “QR code” and “phishing,” is a form of social engineering attack that involves the use of malicious QR codes. These codes, when scanned, can redirect unsuspecting victims to fraudulent websites designed to steal personal information, install malware, or initiate unauthorised transactions. While phishing scams typically rely on emails or fake websites, quishing takes advantage of the convenience and perceived trustworthiness of QR codes. Cybercriminals can create malicious QR codes and place them in public spaces, such as restaurants, airports, or even on product packaging, luring victims into scanning them. The Dangers of Quishing The prevalence of quishing is a cause for concern for several reasons: As the world becomes increasingly reliant on QR code technology, experts fear that quishing incidents may rise even further in 2024. The projected growth in QR code payment systems, with global expenditures expected to exceed $3 trillion by 2025, presents vast opportunities for fraudulent QR code schemes such as quishing.

        "content": "The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma, whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party. That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until \"Jesus comes back.\" Read more of the latest international headlines Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. \"They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,\" Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials -- he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement -- resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp \"He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?\" Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. \"I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,\" Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party's symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing's logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country's population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. If you're on Telegram, subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on top stories Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa's poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. \"I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,\" Ndlovu said. How such loyalty -- and the ANC's irritation over it -- might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. \"It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,\" Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. \"uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. \"The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.\" His six-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK's symbol -- a warrior with a spear and shield.",

        "content": "PAT Sajak has suffered the brunt of one angry contestant who blamed the Wheel of Fortune host for distracting him. But Pat took the accusation in stride, and snarked back at the player. On a recent Wheel of Fortune episode, Michael Bystrzycki, a master electrician from Drummonds, Tennessee , was working his way through a Crossword round, where contestants are asked to solve a series of interconnected words with the same lead-in. In this case, the four words all had \"fire\" as the first part. Michael looked to be about to solve the puzzle, when he suddenly changed course and decided to spin the wheel one more time. He landed on Bankrupt - losing everything. Luckily for him, his turn eventually came again, and after making a comeback, correctly solved Fire - \"works, wood, department, and pit.\" After celebrating his win, Pat wanted to know what was stumping him before. \"Which one were you shaky on the first time?\" he asked, opening a can of worms. \"None. I just looked at you instead of looking at the puzzle, and 'works' went out my head,\" Michael immediately shot back. \"I was like, 'ah, he said spin, so I’m spinning'. Let’s go\". A depressed Pat simply threw his arms up, looked directly at the camera, and snapped back a sarcastic, \"It’s always my fault.\" Michael had the last laugh, however, winning the game - and then the bonus round - leaving the show with a new Infinity car and an overall total of $111,160 in cash and prizes. It wasn't the first time Pat has been called out by a contestant. Late last year, a contestant named Jill failed to solve the final round puzzle, \"Voicing Our Opinion.\" That's when she decided to voice hers . \"Come on,\" she said. Premiering in 1975, the beloved game show has had a few different iconic hosts in its nearly 50 seasons. 1975 - 1981 : Chuck Woolery was the original host of Wheel of Fortune until he departed in 1981. 1981 - June 2024: Pat Sajak took over and became a beloved Wheel of Fortune host for over 40 years. September 2024: Ryan Seacrest was declared the newest host as Sajak announced his retirement . Pat seemed caught off guard and replied, \"What do you mean, come on?\" She turned to the host and flat-out asked, \"What kind of puzzle is that?\" Pat looked shocked by the pushback and held a finger up. \"It’s a puzzle you didn’t solve,\" he slammed back, causing the audience to roar in laughter. Jill missed out on an additional $40,000 per the glitzy prize card but still got her existing $27,680. Pat won't have to play the victim for much longer. The 77-year-old announced last year that he’s retiring from the game show at the end of this 41st season, which is now only days away . In June 2023, Pat revealed he would soon be leaving the show, and it was announced soon after that Ryan Seacrest would be taking over as host. Almost a year later, Pat’s final episode of Wheel of Fortune is almost here. The big finale was filmed last month and is currently set to air on June 7 . With Pat now readying to leaving, the show has prepared a series of tributes. The weeklong goodbye will be called Thanks for the Memories and will culminate with his final episode.",

        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the airstrike that Gazan authorities said killed dozens of civilians in a Rafah tent camp a “tragic mistake.” Authorities in Hamas-run Gaza said that at least 45 people were killed and nearly 250 were injured in the airstrike, which Israel said targeted two senior Hamas terrorists. Netanyahu said that Israel is investigating what happened. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said on Monday to the country’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” If the death toll is confirmed, the airstrike would mark the deadliest incident in Rafah since Israel began its incursion into the area earlier this month. The White House also addressed the Rafah strike on Monday. A National Security Council spokesperson said that U.S. officials are engaged with officials in the Israel Defense Forces to assess the situation. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,” the spokesperson said. “But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Some 900,000 Palestinians have fled from Rafah after the IDF issued evacuation orders for parts of the city earlier this month after Hamas launched an attack from Rafah near a key border crossing that is the primary entry point for humanitarian aid. Also on Monday, Israeli and Egyptian troops exchanged gunfire at the Rafah border crossing, reportedly resulting in the death of one Egyptian.",

        "content": "Airtel Africa has emerged as a major winner at the inaugural ICAN-NGX Awards, taking home the Most Outstanding in Financial Reporting and the overall gold across all categories. According to a statement, the honours were announced at a special ceremony held at the Nigerian Stock Exchange headquarters in Lagos, recently. The awards, organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and NGX Regulation Limited, recognised excellence in corporate reporting among the top 30 most capitalised companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange for the 2022 financial reporting year. The release stated that Airtel Africa stood out in three key areas: financial reporting, corporate governance, and sustainability reporting, adding that in financial reporting, the company edged out industry giants, such as Dangote Cement and MTN Nigeria Communications, to take the top prize. The company’s commitment to transparency and accountability was also recognised in the Corporate Governance category, while its comprehensive and transparent disclosure of environmental, social, and governance performance earned it top honours in Sustainability Reporting. Speaking on the awards, the Group Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Nigeria, Carl Cruz, averred, “At Airtel, we strive to set the benchmark for excellence in financial reporting and corporate reporting, and these awards validate our efforts in this regard. “We have been deliberate in maintaining a painstaking dedication to transparency for the sake of our shareholders, which is also how we keep our promises to our shareholders.” Airtel Africa also received the Gold Award in the Corporate Reporting Category. This award, according to Cruz, underscored Airtel’s culture of fair business practices. “Today’s recognition reminds us to keep upholding the fundamental principles of integrity, accountability, and ethical conduct across all facets of its operations,” he noted. In his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of NGX Regulation Limited, Mr Olufemi Shobanjo, stressed the significance of the award, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability in building a more productive market environment. “It is noteworthy that integrity is an important drive in ensuring a successful business. In this vein, the Corporate Reporting Award underscores our collective commitment to fostering a capital market that operates on principles of transparency, integrity, and excellence,” he explained.",

        "content": "Tom Brady seemed ready to hit the summer vibes with his kids that he shares with his ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, just after jokes from his Netflix special, The Roast of Tom Brady , went viral and upset some people. The retired NFL star posted a clip on Instagram on Monday, showing off himself having some fun in the water, enjoying good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!,” he captioned the clip, which had Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's I Had Some Help playing in the background. The 46-year-old flexed his ripped body in the video post while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. Glimpses showed his kids also joining in on the fun. The sports personality’s beach vacation comes just days after Brady’s Netflix roast that mocked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ, who shares a son, Jack, 16, with ex-Bridget Moynahan, admitted he “didn’t like” how his children were “affected” by jokes targeted st his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he confessed on The Pivot podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.”",

        "content": "After an epic rainstorm and four hours of delays, the 2024 Indianapolis 500 delivered one of the most compelling races in the sport’s history. Josef Newgarden of Team Penske may have crossed the yard of bricks in first position, but a simple finishing order never quite tells the full story when a race lasts for 200 fascinating laps that saw 49 lead changes and a record 18 different leaders. The 108th running of the Indy 500 created hundreds of fascinating storylines, but today, we’re going to recap the biggest winners — and the biggest losers. WINNER: Josef Newgarden and Team Penske It hasn’t been a good year to be a Team Penske driver. Both Josef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin were disqualified from the season opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida for illegally utilizing Push to Pass, which provides limited bursts of boost to aid in overtaking, on restarts. Newgarden, who utilized that system illegally more than anyone else, lost his win at the race and faced down a massive amount of criticism for hosting an emotional press conference where he insisted that he did not cheat. The whole affair has soured many fans; even though Newgarden and McLaughlin were disqualified, and even though Team Penske suspended several critical team members for two races (including the Indy 500), there’s a large group of folks who feel that that wasn’t enough — especially because team owner Roger Penske also owns the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. There’s a lot of speculation that this cheating scandal is a conspiracy, and that there are simply far too many conflicts of interest. It’ll be difficult for Penske and Newgarden to completely leave this affair in the past, but it’s also difficult to argue that Newgarden and Team Penske did not deserve their victory — the 20th 500 win for Roger. Newgarden’s masterful back-to-back performance at the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, however, is a step in the right direction. LOSER: Honda Of the 11 drivers that retired from the 2024 Indianapolis 500, nine were Honda-powered. Of those nine Honda retirements, three were mechanical failures. The two Chevrolet retirements were solely due to contact. It’s a bitter pill to swallow for the Honda camp; the Japanese manufacturer struggled throughout the entire month of May. While Honda’s teams appeared to have strong race pace in practice, its qualifying effort was poor: All six drivers in the first two rows of the grid were Chevy drivers, and all four of the slowest drivers competing for the final three grid slots were Honda drivers. In the race itself, only three Honda drivers finished in the top 10. David Salters, president of Honda Racing Corporation USA, said, “It was a disappointing day. All things considered, we weren’t good enough on the day. We’ll regroup, lick our wounds, focus our efforts, and come back.” Prior to the race, Salters joined a media availability session for journalists who had been invited as guests of Honda. During that session, he admitted that the debut of hybrid engines had required some compromises in terms of Indy 500 preparation, and that Honda had actually fallen behind performance expectations when it came time to compete at the Speedway. The answers for the drop in performance are not immediately available, but it certainly doesn’t bode well for Honda, which is currently rumored to be looking for an IndyCar exit strategy. WINNER: Pato O’Ward No, this placement isn’t a mistake — despite losing an almost guaranteed win after an audacious last-lap pass from Newgarden, Arrow McLaren driver Pato O’Ward has every right to be devastated. He also has every right to be included on the winner list. At 25 years old, O’Ward has actively raced in five Indy 500s and has performed admirably in every single one. In his debut race, he finished sixth. He followed that with a fourth-place finish in 2021, then a second in 2022. His 24th-place classification in 2023 doesn’t quite tell the story of his battle for the lead and unfortunate crash within the final 10 laps. This year, he passed Newgarden on the final lap; in every other year, that would have meant victory. In 2024. It wasn’t enough. O’Ward exited the car with a heavy heart and heavier sobs, offering heartbreaking interviews to the media. And yet O’Ward has matured immensely, both in IndyCar as a whole and at the Indy 500, over the past few years. The Mexican driver had produced stunning performances and many equally stunning crashes thanks to his fiery demeanor; his 2023 victory in the 500 was almost assured until he crashed in attempting to pass Marcus Ericsson. This year, O’Ward’s drive was just as inspired, but it was far more measured. His racing line in the final stages sliced apexes and set him up for perfect passes. It wasn’t enough, but an O’Ward of a different year may very well have wrecked himself and the leader trying to win. It was a devastating result, but O’Ward should be proud. He has a long and impressive career ahead of him at the Speedway. LOSER: Kyle Larson All things considered, NASCAR star Kyle Larson had an impressive debut at the Indianapolis 500. Despite accruing a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, he completed all 200 laps and took home an 18th-place finish for his efforts. He committed to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway despite the rain and raced incredibly well. He has much to be proud of. But Larson has stumbled onto our losers list for one big reason: His attempt at completing the “Double” — or, racing in the Indy 500 followed by NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 — was squashed by poor weather and NASCAR politics. Larson stuck around for the 500’s four-hour rain delay and completed the event, then immediately jetted off to Charlotte Motor Speedway. He arrived at the track just as the race was flagged for weather. Because NASCAR had completed half distance, and because humidity in the area was set to make track drying problematic, and because it was already late, NASCAR called the race. Larson wasn’t able to turn a single lap. Now, he may be facing a slew of repercussions. At this time of writing, NASCAR has not provided Larson with a “waiver” that approves his missing the Coca-Cola 600. As a result, there is still a chance that Larson will be entirely disqualified from the NASCAR Championship because he failed to compete in one race — even though it wasn’t his fault. Many pundits in the NASCAR sphere are also actively arguing that Larson be denied a waiver, angry because one of their finest drivers had prioritized another race in another series over the Cup Series. Rather than celebrate his performance, they demand punishment (especially as other drivers like Ryan Blaney toy with the idea of attempting the same feat in the future). This may be Larson’s last attempt at completing the Double — and it may also spell the end of any attempts in the future. 👉 F1 v IndyCar: Top speeds, engines, formats, calendars and safety measures all compared 👉 Which drivers are paid the most? F1, IndyCar and NASCAR salaries revealed WINNER: Scott Dixon Qualifying did not look good for Scott Dixon. The six-time IndyCar champion and one-time 500 winner qualified on the outside of the seventh row for the 108th running of the event. Despite starting 21st, he finished third. As we noted before, Honda’s engines just weren’t cut out for the task of winning the 500 this year; if they had been, Dixon’s exceptional performance would have set him up as a dominant victor. He was one of a few drivers that tried an alternate pit strategy, and luck played into his favor as his competition retired. He carved through the field and was briefly one of the race’s 18 leaders, showing yet again that he is truly one of the finest open-wheel racers in the world. LOSER: Katherine Legge Katherine Legge made her Indy 500 return in 2023 after nine years away from the track, but her race ended in disappointment. She returned to IMS in 2024 seeking redemption, but her Dale Coyne Racing No. 51 machine let her down: on lap 23, Legge slowed on the track as smoke poured from the rear of her car. Her engine had failed, and she would retire from the race after just 57 of its 500 miles. While Legge wasn’t the only Honda driver to face an engine issue, her result was uniquely disappointing. The 44-year-old was the only woman in the field, and one of only nine women to ever compete at Indianapolis. She arrived for a one-off attempt at the race with ample backing from sponsor e.l.f. Cosmetics and served as a huge inspiration to female fans around the globe. It is unclear if Legge will return for another shot at the race; it would be truly disappointing for her Indianapolis efforts to end in back-to-back retirements after breaking so many records and being such a fantastic ambassador for the sport. WINNER: e.l.f. Cosmetics Even though e.l.f. Cosmetics driver Katherine Legge exited the race early, the brand was a serious winner of the Indy 500 this year. The makeup brand sponsored Legge in 2023, then came back to provide a primary partnership in 2024. Further, e.l.f. signed on as a partner of the 2024 Indy 500 and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Its investment in the sport was clear. Not only did e.l.f. put on an exceptional drone show over downtown Indianapolis on the Saturday night before the race, but it also developed a massive “lip oil change” fan activation in the infield. There, fans of all kinds could get a makeover, enter a contest to win a year’s supply of lip oil, learn about the nine women who have contested the Indy 500, and collect sample products and Legge-specific merchandise items. The merchandise itself included scarves, hats and magnets while the samples were as generic as sunscreen and lip balm, or as glamorous as mascara and plumping lipstick. Of all the activations in the fan area — which included displays from other sponsors like Good Ranchers and Verizon — the e.l.f. display was both the most elaborate and the most well attended. It was the only activation that actively provided an experience and products designed for a female audience, but it was just as welcoming for the men who perused its offerings. The sponsorship represents a shift in motorsport demographics; while women have always watched and competed in racing, few sponsors (outside of, say, lingerie companies) have actually considered their wants or needs. Now, women are so prevalent in the racing world that big-name woman-focused brands like e.l.f. can see a benefit in investing time, money, and resources into motorsport because it knows it can see a return on its investment. That’s a huge win for e.l.f., for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and for women involved in motorsport around the world. LOSER: Colton Herta Colton Herta is notorious for both his bad luck and his small mistakes — neither of which ever seem to strike at the same time. His 2024 season has been one of his most consistent yet, and during the first half of the 2024 Indy 500, he looked like an exceptional contender for the lead after putting on a promising show in practice. Unfortunately for the Californian driver, he lost control of his car on the entry to Turn 1 on lap 86. While he did appear to save it momentarily, a second bump of oversteer meant Herta careened into the wall. He had fought his way up from 13th to second before losing control. Herta’s Andretti Autosport team brought the car back to the garage, where it deemed the damage to be repairable. Herta ultimately finished 170 of the race’s 200 laps and was classified as the 23rd-place finisher — but it was a serious blow to one of the fastest Honda drivers of the race. WINNER: The Fans When a race is delayed several hours for severe weather, it can be a challenge to keep fans both safe and happy. This year, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway proved why it remains one of the finest sporting venues in the world with its handling of the rain delay. First and foremost, when it became clear earlier this month that weather may impact the 500, IMS rented the high-powered jet dryers that NASCAR uses to clear its tracks of moisture. On the day of the race, it provided fans with ample safe areas to seek shelter and a long heads-up to get there. Track cell service and WiFi remained strong, and as the lightning cleared, a group of dedicated fans organized foot races that drew huge crowds and kept the atmosphere buzzing. The track dried quickly, IMS still provided a tradition-packed pre-race show, and when the green flag finally flew, it felt just as special as any other race day. The exceptional show was simply the cherry on top of a stress-free and impressively organized event. LOSER: Meyer Shank Racing Oh, Meyer Shank Racing. The plucky team has had one of its finest years yet in IndyCar racing, boasting one pole position and securing several top-10 finishes — and it looked set to replicate that performance in the Indy 500. Félix Rosenqvist was one of the three Hondas in the Fast 12 qualifying session, but he was one of several Honda drivers to suffer engine issues on race day. Meanwhile, sportscar ace Tom Blomqvist embarrassed the team with a first-lap crash. He dropped below the white line in Turn 1 and, as he lost control, he crashed into Marcus Ericsson. Pietro Fittipaldi and Callum Ilott made contact trying to avoid the wreck, bringing out the first caution of the race — and becoming the first three retirements in the 500. That left the team’s hopes in the hands of four-time 500 winner Hélio Castroneves. The Brazilian had a beastly run in the race, passing five cars in as many laps and racing hard to make up for his 20th-place starting position. Unfortunately, he suffered a poor pit stop that saw him lose out on all that hard work. He crossed the line in 20th.

Advertisement The impact of inflation is now projected to get even worse for millions of older adults in the US. The Senior Citizens League's latest projection forecasts Social Security's 2025 cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to be just 2.66%, the lowest increase since before the pandemic. That is below the level of inflation, which has hovered around 3.5% in recent months . This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The COLA for Social Security benefits was 3.2% in 2024. According to an ongoing survey by The Senior Citizens League , 71% of older Americans did not think this year's increase was enough to cover their rising bills at the time of publication. Related stories \"With the forecast of a 2.66% COLA for 2025, it appears seniors will continue to suffer financial insecurity as much next year as they have this year,\" said Shannon Benton , executive director of The Senior Citizens League. Advertisement According to the Social Security Administration , the average monthly benefit in 2024 is $1,907, up about $50 from 2023. According to Benton, the net benefit increase was just $40.20 after the cost of Medicare rose by $9.80 each month. Meanwhile, according to The Senior Citizen League's survey, 43% of respondents said their monthly expenses had increased by at least $185 a month in 2023 compared to the previous year. Over 67 million Americans receive Social Security. Ippei Naoi/Getty Images Social Security recipients typically receive an increase in their benefits in January to compensate for the rising cost of living. The exact amount is based on the level of inflation observed in The Bureau of Labor Statistics' consumer price index (CPI) from July through September of the previous year. The cost-of-living increase can vary wildly each year . In 2020, the final adjustment based on pre-pandemic inflation, the COLA was 1.3%. In 2022, the increase was 8.7%. Advertisement Over 67 million Americans receive Social Security, and an increase is not guaranteed. Since the COLA was added to Social Security benefits in 1975, there have been three years without a bump in the monthly checks. Like many Americans, the cost of food appears to be one area of inflation that is hitting older adults the hardest. In The Senior Citizen League's survey, 61% of respondents said food was their most increased expense. According to the USDA, their recommended food budget has increased by 27% since 2020. This is one of the biggest reasons Americans still don't feel good about the economy .",

        "content": "Jonathan Fortin woke up on May 24 morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Mr. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme ForThé in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd—close to 75 animals—were stolen,” he said in an interview on May 27. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on May 24 and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Mr. Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. Mr. Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on May 23, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Mr. Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Mr. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he'll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said.",

        "content": "TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — “Today, the Government of Ontario announced the , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario’s hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario’s REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder’s history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle’ homes to Ontario’s housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.” Manager, Media Relations 416-459-6059",

        "content": "has publicly shown her support for in a heartfelt message posted on Instagram. The Skims founder led tributes, alongside her mom, to mark the dad-of-three's birthday over Memorial Day weekend. Kim took to Instagram Stories to share a photo of the pair of them together, alongside the message: \"Happy birthday @letthelordbewithyou I love you and I hope you're having the best day!\" Kris also marked the occasion, sharing a number of snapshots of herself with Scott over the years, along with several photos of Scott and his three children - Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, nine. She wrote: \" Happy Birthday Scott @letthelordbewithyou!!! Wishing you an amazing year filled with health, happiness and love. You’re the best dad, uncle, friend and son and we love you very much!!!!!\" Scott himself marked his birthday on social media by sharing several photos from the day, including a sweet picture of his children Penelope and Reign standing in front of a birthday display at their house in Los Angeles, complete with helium balloons and presents. The pair were even wearing birthday hats, and Scott wrote alongside the snapshot: \"Aint love grand. Love you guys!! Best bday a day could ever wish 4.\" Scott is still very much part of the Kardashian family and features in the long-running reality show, The Kardashians. Most recently, he gave an insight into his relationship with his firstborn, Mason, while chatting to Kris. \"He's great, he's really unbelievable,' he said during the season five premiere of the show. \"We're closer than ever.\" He went on to tell Kris that Mason was looking forward to turning 16, as his grandmother had promised him a car. While Scott tends to share photos of Penelope and Reign on social media, he rarely posts pictures of Mason. However, the teenager has recently stepped into the spotlight after opening a public Instagram account. He is currently only following eight people, who are all family members, including Scott and his mom, Kourtney Kardashian, as well as his grandmother, Kris Jenner, and aunts Khloe and Kim, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and uncle Rob Kardashian. Kourtney and Scott live near each other to make it easy for their children to see both their parents regularly. They have been incredibly open about their co-parenting journey, and in 2020 they sat down for a discussion on Poosh. Kourtney said: \"I do think we are very lucky to be doing it this way and we can if we have an issue or something that, you know, one of the kids is going through, we can deal with it together. And, you know, nobody knows our kids better than us so to be able to do that together and like come up with solutions together, I think is, you know, there’s no better ... like what else could you want.\" Since then, Kourtney has gone on to find love with Travis Barker, and the pair welcomed their baby son Rocky 13 in November.

        "description": "Sinn Féin has knocked back a Green party plan for Belfast City Council to go vegan.",
        "content": "At a recent council committee meeting in City Hall the parties went up against each other over a motion by the Greens to impose a “fully plant-based procurement” on council buildings. The Strategic Policy and Resources Committee nevertheless voted for council officers to prepare a report looking at how a vegan policy would be costed and implemented. The Green motion states the council “agrees to engage with the Plant Based Councils initiative and to commit to fully plant-based procurement where food is served throughout the council estate, prioritising seasonal local produce to support local farmers, and ensure that there are plant-based food options available at all city council run events, as well as prioritising plant-based menu options in council run facilities.” Green councillor Anthony Flynn, who proposed the motion, told the committee he was asking for a “feasibility” report on the proposal. “This aligns with our obligations in the Belfast Agenda, in terms of tackling health inequalities and increasing our city’s resilience to climate change, as well as the Belfast City Council declaration of a climate emergency in 2019,” he said. “One of the recommendations in the 2021 UK National Food Strategy recommended that local authorities ensure that ratepayer money is spent on healthy and sustainable foods. “Vegan or plant-based diets are better for the environment as they produce a quarter of the emissions compared to diets including meat, less than half of the water consumed and less of an impact on water pollution and biodiversity. “Local authorities have a huge role to play in helping inform the public in making healthy and sustainable food choices. “Belfast Healthy Cities says that reviewing procurement policies for transport and food could enhance health and sustainability for people and the planet.” Sinn Féin councillor Ronan McLaughlin said he “would have some problems” in terms of procurement, as it would see the council “having to deal with plant based caterers, which would narrow the market, and increase the general overall cost”. “I am happy with having options, but this is supposed to be a just transition, it is not about forcing people to eat plant based food, they should be doing it for their own reasons, not because an authority tries to impose it onto them,” he added. “It should be about people making the right choices through an education process, not through a forced process. “And I would be worried about the cost. In terms of the current climate, the cost of living crisis, I don’t think we can agree to increase the catering budget of the council. I don’t think the public would stand for that. I don’t think it is a good look at all.” Green councillor Brian Smyth said: “What councillor Flynn is asking for is reasonable. He is asking for a report to come back – if there are issues with procurement they will be set out. “That is fair, there are lots of things that go to report and come back with options, and people say further down the line it isn’t for us.” Sinn Féin councillor Micheal Donnelly said council catering free meals and drink for councillors at full council meetings and committee was “a bit outdated.” He asked for a report on “cost implications” of feeding the 60 Belfast councillors at every meeting with a view to ending it. He said: “We are big and ugly enough to feed ourselves if we are hungry, and grab a sandwich before we go to a committee or full council.” The committee also agreed to look at costs for councillor food.",

        "description": "Sinn Féin has knocked back a Green party plan for Belfast City Council to go vegan.",
        "content": "At a recent council committee meeting in City Hall the parties went up against each other over a motion by the Greens to impose a “fully plant-based procurement” on council buildings. The Strategic Policy and Resources Committee nevertheless voted for council officers to prepare a report looking at how a vegan policy would be costed and implemented. The Green motion states the council “agrees to engage with the Plant Based Councils initiative and to commit to fully plant-based procurement where food is served throughout the council estate, prioritising seasonal local produce to support local farmers, and ensure that there are plant-based food options available at all city council run events, as well as prioritising plant-based menu options in council run facilities.” Green councillor Anthony Flynn, who proposed the motion, told the committee he was asking for a “feasibility” report on the proposal. “This aligns with our obligations in the Belfast Agenda, in terms of tackling health inequalities and increasing our city’s resilience to climate change, as well as the Belfast City Council declaration of a climate emergency in 2019,” he said. “One of the recommendations in the 2021 UK National Food Strategy recommended that local authorities ensure that ratepayer money is spent on healthy and sustainable foods. “Vegan or plant-based diets are better for the environment as they produce a quarter of the emissions compared to diets including meat, less than half of the water consumed and less of an impact on water pollution and biodiversity. “Local authorities have a huge role to play in helping inform the public in making healthy and sustainable food choices. “Belfast Healthy Cities says that reviewing procurement policies for transport and food could enhance health and sustainability for people and the planet.” Sinn Féin councillor Ronan McLaughlin said he “would have some problems” in terms of procurement, as it would see the council “having to deal with plant based caterers, which would narrow the market, and increase the general overall cost”. “I am happy with having options, but this is supposed to be a just transition, it is not about forcing people to eat plant based food, they should be doing it for their own reasons, not because an authority tries to impose it onto them,” he added. “It should be about people making the right choices through an education process, not through a forced process. “And I would be worried about the cost. In terms of the current climate, the cost of living crisis, I don’t think we can agree to increase the catering budget of the council. I don’t think the public would stand for that. I don’t think it is a good look at all.” Green councillor Brian Smyth said: “What councillor Flynn is asking for is reasonable. He is asking for a report to come back – if there are issues with procurement they will be set out. “That is fair, there are lots of things that go to report and come back with options, and people say further down the line it isn’t for us.” Sinn Féin councillor Micheal Donnelly said council catering free meals and drink for councillors at full council meetings and committee was “a bit outdated.” He asked for a report on “cost implications” of feeding the 60 Belfast councillors at every meeting with a view to ending it. He said: “We are big and ugly enough to feed ourselves if we are hungry, and grab a sandwich before we go to a committee or full council.” The committee also agreed to look at costs for councillor food.",

The youngest son of the King made a speech at St Paul's Cathedral to hail the achievements of the competition he started for wounded servicemen and women when he was a working royal in 2014.

The ex- New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, 46, recently shared a video of himself enjoying the Memorial Day weekend. And the clip put Brady 's remarkable physique on full display. The seven-time Super Bowl champion could be seen soaking up the rays while doing watersports with his children. The NFL legend also tried some solo wakesurfing and fell off on numerous occasions, causing a big splash. \"You guys okay if we get summer started?\" Brady captioned the post . \"Hope everyone is having a great MDW!\" And fans loved the update – while pointing out that Brady looked ready to return to the field again if he wanted to. \"Tom is looking better than ever,\" one commented. \"Could still come out and toss 4500 and 30 TDs,\" another added. \"Someone looks to be in football shape,\" a third said. \"Tom could win a Super Bowl at 70. Shredded to the gills,\" one wrote. Brady is set to begin his broadcasting career this year as part of his 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports. The retired quarterback will replace Greg Olsen as the network's top color analyst. He will call games alongside play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt in a team that also features sideline reporter Erin Andrews . Andrews recently said she was confident that Brady would do well in the booth. In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon , the Fox Sports star recalled how Brady kept telling fascinating stories about his career at lunch once. \"And it's stuff we just die for. Love the inside information,\" Andrews said. \"And you are hearing stuff that you've just always wanted to know. And my knee was just bouncing.\" Andrews' colleague and podcast partner Charissa Thompson was also sure that Brady would be just fine behind the mic. \"His resume supports that he is great at everything he does,\" Thompson noted. \"So why would this be any different?\"",

Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Defeat for Cam Norrie at 🇬🇧 | — LTA (@the_LTA) Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. “I’m pretty devastated with the result, the first four sets I was in control, I had so many chances,” said Norrie. “I didn’t play well at all but I still should have won comfortably. I felt physically good, practice has been going well. I couldn’t believe I was in a fifth set.” https://x.com/the_LTA/status/1795165025331560569 Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Dart said: “I felt I played an OK match to be honest, I always knew it would be a tough match. I’m just disappointed I didn’t capitalise on some of my opportunities.” Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

        "description": "Auckland water taxi company is prepared to build two ferries if council subsidises fares.",
        "content": "A ferry service between Mount Maunganui and Tauranga could be on the way in 2025. Auckland water taxi company Hauraki Express is prepared to build two ferries for the service if local councils will subsidise the fares. It would begin as a two-year trial with the goal of becoming a permanent service that could expand to include new routes in time, Hauraki Express director Peter Bourke said. The ferries would run from Salisbury Wharf in downtown Mount Maunganui to Tauranga city centre. Tauranga City Council agreed to fund half of the costs of a ferry trial for passengers and bikes at a meeting last week. But their agreement is contingent on the Bay of Plenty Regional Council paying the other half. The maximum cost for each council would be $1.4m over the two years. Bourke said the fare would cost around $6 and the trip between Tauranga and Mount Maunganui would take around 17 minutes each way. The fully-enclosed ferries would have seating for 30 people and space for 15 bikes. Bourke’s daughter Amy, who lives in Tauranga, saw an opportunity for their family business after looking at previous studies, he said. A November 2023 feasibility report by the regional council said there would be significant cost barriers with ferry operations. The cost to the regional council if it were to buy and refit three vessels would have been $4.5m with an annual running cost of $700,000. This could have made the fare for a single trip $404 on one of the proposed routes if patronage was low. Hauraki Express was willing to take on the operational costs and build the ferries if councils were willing to subsidise the fares, Bourke said. ”We’ve fully analysed the feasibility of a simple, small and economical ferry service.” The smaller vessels would be cheaper to run but still cater for the demand, Bourke said. They would also need the support of the community if the trial was to be a success, he said. ”We’ll take the risk but give us your support.” Special projects manager Amy Bourke said she and her young family faced daily challenges with traffic congestion. ”We see this as an innovative solution. It’s looking at a problem a little bit differently.” The ferry would facilitate mode-shift getting people using alternative modes of transport from cars, she said. ”We want to make Tauranga a harbour city, rather than a port city.” Peter Bourke said many people saw the harbour as something they had to drive around to get to their destination. ”We want to turn that into an opportunity rather than a hindrance.” At the city council meeting, commissioner Stephen Selwood said it was a great opportunity to test the market for a ferry service through a public-private partnership. Commission chair Anne Tolley said the councils had been talking about getting ferries back into the harbour for three to four years. The investment from both councils wasn’t huge and a two-year trial was sufficient to see if it would work, she said. ”I think we should literally get on with it, it would be a pretty popular decision for us to make.” The regional council will decide whether to fund their half at a meeting in early June. If the councils agree to subsidise fares, Peter Bourke said they aim to have the service running by Easter 2025 - LDR is local body journalism co-funded by RNZ and NZ On Air. Share this article",

        "content": "The NFL today is one of America’s most entertaining and richest leagues. In just a six-month window in 2023, the NFL earned a whopping $20 billion. Logically, the league should look to expand throughout the year like its peers in the NBA, NHL or the MLB who are deemed to have a game almost every week of the year. However NFL, despite its immense economic potential has the shortest schedule of all. The reason is player welfare . It’s no secret that football is one of the most dangerous contact sports in the world. In a routine player collision in the NFL, a 30-40 G’s force is recorded. To put this into context, an airforce pilot experiences a force of 10Gs while making a tight turn in his fighter jet. As evident from the example, players routinely pick up heavy knocks throughout the 16 match days. Sustaining such high physical strain for six months is a superhuman task in itself. Extending that to a few more months for the sake of entertainment will be a grave injustice to the players. Therefore the league is a six-month affair for the safety of the players. Thus in 1987, the NFLPA took matters into their own hands and went on strike till the league did a U-turn on their decision to extend the season. Since then, the league has been a 6-month affair starting in September and culminating with the Super Bowl in February. Yes, the injury rates drastically reduced last season. As per NFL.com , a whopping 700 fewer injuries were recorded last season. But the injury rates dropping doesn’t necessarily mean that the game is becoming less dangerous. Hence it’s unlikely to see the game expanding anytime soon. However, the NFL’s 6-month window has also been a boon for the growing niche of spring leagues like the UFL. The Short NFL Window Is A Blessing For UFL And The Alternative Football Industry For a long time, multiple business mavericks have tried entering the alternate football industry and failed. From the XFL in the early 2000s to the USFL in recent years, multiple spring leagues have come and gone. However, the recent decision to merge the USFL and the XFL to form the UFL seems to be a step in the right direction for the industry. As mentioned by UFL CEO Russ Brandon , having “ one focused league” is the best step for spring football. The merger also helps the UFL to have a competent product as it has the best minds and bodies from the XFL and the USFL. While there is no guarantee that the United Football League will succeed despite things looking good on paper, the main focus here should be that a league like the UFL is getting a space in American football. Almost every other sporting league in the country is a monopoly except the NFL. So the six-month window fosters healthy competition, an alternative in a true sense for the viewers and an opportunity for the players who miss out on the NFL to still make a living playing football. All said the NFL’s decision to stick to a 6-month window is commendable for the various reasons above. Moreover, a part of the NFL’s exorbitant money-making ability is also its exclusivity factor that year-long leagues don’t offer. Overall, the league should continue this way.",

        "content": "British number one Cameron Norrie slumped out of the French Open in the first round to Russian Pavel Kotov. Norrie, stuck on a sparsely-populated outside court on a cold and breezy Paris afternoon in a match delayed by rain, lost in five tight sets 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 6-2. The 28-year-old, seeded 32, won five games in a row after trailing 4-1 to take the first set. Defeat for Cam Norrie at @rolandgarros #BackTheBrits 🇬🇧 | #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/vCH8ZvvSMs — LTA (@the_LTA) May 27, 2024 Twice Norrie led by a set but twice world number 56 Kotov hit back, taking the match to a decider in a tie-break. Kotov raced into a 4-0 lead and Norrie was unable to peg him back as he bowed out at the first-round stage for the first time since 2020. “I’m pretty devastated with the result, the first four sets I was in control, I had so many chances,” said Norrie. “I didn’t play well at all but I still should have won comfortably. I felt physically good, practice has been going well. I couldn’t believe I was in a fifth set.” https://x.com/the_LTA/status/1795165025331560569 Norrie was joined on the British scrapheap by Harriet Dart, who lost 7-6 (3) 6-4 to Czech 27th seed Linda Noskova. Dart said: “I felt I played an OK match to be honest, I always knew it would be a tough match. I’m just disappointed I didn’t capitalise on some of my opportunities.” Defeats for Andy Murray and Jack Draper on Sunday means Britain’s hopes in singles now rest with Katie Boulter and Dan Evans, who play their first-round matches on Tuesday.",

In a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden paid tribute to the fallen as heroes who sacrificed themselves in the service of American democracy and ideals. Meanwhile, Trump, taking to his Truth Social site, took a very different tack – bestowing holiday wishes on those he branded “human scum” and accused them of trying to destroy the country. Biden and Trump are neck and neck in national polling for the 2024 presidential election, with Trump often narrowly ahead. Trump is, however, polling more strongly in the key swing states that will decide the contest. The targets of Trump’s ire on Memorial Day included the judges who presided over his various trials and a writer who won more than $80m in damages after accusing him of rape. While his predecessor and 2024 opponent fulminated on social media, Biden – accompanied by Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, General CQ Brown, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Vice-President Kamala Harris – visited the the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington, final resting place for revered military heroes and US presidents. Identifying his own family with the notion of national sacrifice, Biden highlighted his son Beau, attributing his death from brain cancer nine years ago this week to his exposure to burn pits while serving in the military in Iraq. “The hurt is still real, still raw,” Biden said, after describing the “black hole” that opens up for family members who hear the news of the death of a relative serving in wartime. “I can still hear him saying, ‘it’s my duty dad, it’s my duty. Duty – that was the code my son lived by ... the creed the generation of service members have followed into battle on the grounds around us by fallen heroes.” Biden’s words seemed calculated to contrast with previous comments attributed to Trump about fallen members of the military, whom he is said to have derided as “losers” and “suckers” for allowing themselves to be killed in battle. If so, the glaring disparity was further emphasised by Trump’s Memorial Day outburst, which reprised previous holiday volleys of abuse aimed at his enemies and opponents. “Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn’t count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for ‘DEFAMATION,’” he wrote. That comment was aimed at Lewis Kaplan, the judge in a civil trial brought by the writer E Jean Carroll, who alleged that Trump raped and then defamed her. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Stakes — US Election Edition Free newsletter The Guardian guides you through the chaos of a hugely consequential presidential election Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He then turned his attention to Judge Arthur Engoron, who ruled in a civil lawsuit last year that the former president and presumptive 2024 Republican nominee had committed fraud by overvaluing his assets – and to Judge Juan Merchan, who is in charge of Trump’s current hush money trial in which he is accused of falsifying documents to cover up an affair with a porn actor. He referred to Engoron as “the [New York] state wacko judge who fined me 500 Million Dollars (UNDER APPEAL) for DOING NOTHING WRONG” before adding: “Now for Merchan!” Prosecutors and lawyers are scheduled to present their closing arguments on Tuesday in the trial, which has been running for four weeks and in which Trump faces 34 counts of paying money to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election, which he won over Hillary Clinton. The framing of the forthcoming election campaign as a competition about personal character is generally thought to be beneficial to Biden, who is consistently seen to be lagging behind Trump in polls quizzing voters about who has the greatest competence over economic affairs.",

        "content": "Pgiam/iStock via Getty Images Investment Summary Since my last publication on IQVIA Holdings Inc. ( NYSE: IQV ) in January 2023, there have been multiple positive updates to the company's fundamental economics. Last time, I commented on the company's strengths in unlocking risk capital for shareholders, namely via 1) exceptional net operating profit after tax relative to the capital invested to produce these numbers, 2) decompression of post-tax margins with increasing capital turnover, and 3) the company's propensity to throw off stable, high amounts of free cash flow to its owners. Figure 1. IQV price evolution, 12 months Seeking Alpha You can check out a deeper analysis on what the company does, its business lines, and recent business trends in my prior IQV analyses (click here , here , and here ). To recall, IQVA is in the advanced analytics and clinical research services business. It has three divisions, (i) technology and analytics, (ii) research and development, and (iii) contract sales and medical solutions; each serves the global life sciences industry. In 2014, the company did $4.16 billion of revenues on $357 million of earnings. It had grown this to $11.08 billion in sales on $191 million in earnings by 2020 and printed $14.9 billion in revenues last year with earnings of $1.36 billion. This translates to exceptional growth of ~17.6% per year from 2014-2020, with another 11% compounding growth from 2020-2023. Similarly, earnings have grown at a strong CAGR of 22% in the last 9 years, and compounded at 68% per year on average from 2020 to its annual results in 2023. Table 1. IQV performance Period Revenues CAGR (%) Earnings CAGR (%) 2014-2020 17.67 -15.90 2020-2023 11.02 68.37 2014-2023 14.24 22.60 Click to enlarge Source: Company filings Investors continue to pay high prices to buy the company today, in addition to the healthcare sector in general. IQVA currently trades at 31x trailing earnings , in line with the sector multiple of ~32x, and is priced at 17x forward EBIT, again in line with the sector. Despite this, the company's stock price has tracked sideways YTD in 2024 amid a trending broad market. To me, this suggests a potential price dislocation, as 1) IQV's earnings multiples have come down over the past three years, yet, 2) earnings have continued to grow at a steady rate, and 3) it continues to throw off high piles of free cash flow to methodically rotate into earnings growth, as I will show here today. The tests driving my bullish thesis is that IQV: Free cash flow production combined with earning growth. Increasing capital turnover, suggesting greater efficiency on assets employed in the business. Current valuations, supported by my projections of economic profit out to 2028, discounted at a 12% hurdle rate. Based on these points, as you will see here today, my views are that IQV remains undervalued and is worth ~$248 per share in my base case today. Q1 2024 Earnings Insights It was another strong period in Q1 2024 from IQV in my opinion. It did $3.7 billion worth of business in the quarter and pulled this to adjusted EBITDA of $862 million, and earnings of $1.56 per share, ~14% year-on-year growth on a trailing 12-month basis. Importantly, excluding all COVID-19 related revenues, the company expanded its top line by 600 basis points from the prior year. Around 1% of this gross was driven from acquisitions, the remaining 5% from the underlying business. Strength was observed across the portfolio, with the following topline results reported for each segment: Technology and analytics: Revenues of $1.45 billion, up 60 basis points year-on-year. Research and development solutions: Produced sales of $2.1 billion, up 340 basis points year-on-year. Management remains constructive on this division's outlook going forward. For instance, it noted that backlog grew 8% year-on-year up to $30.1 million, with net new bookings of $2.6 billion. This equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 (as a reminder, a book-to-bill ratio >1 is preferred, indicating the company has more orders in its pipeline than it can fulfill at a point in time). Contract sales and medical solutions: Sales were up 380 basis points year-on-year to $189 million, with no headwinds mentioned by management. Management now projects $15.3 billion-$15.5 billion in top-line sales this year, calling for 2%-4% growth. Critically, this includes a forex impairment of ~100 basis points. This is not concerning to me for a couple of reasons. For one, here at Bernard, we are looking for companies that have a revenue base outside of the US at the moment. Given the fiscal and economic situation in the US, this may be warranted in my opinion. In Q1 2024, of the company's $3.7 billion in sales, $1.8 billion was produced in the Americas, whereas $1.15 billion was produced in Europe and Africa, and $778 million was produced in the Asia Pacific region. This is a good geographical split in my opinion, reducing concentration risk at the top line, and giving good exposure to non-US sources of revenue. Management expects to pull these revenues to adjusted EBITDA of around $3.8 billion at the top end (6.5% year-on-year growth), and earnings of $11.25 per share on a non-GAAP basis. My views on the company's first-quarter numbers are that 1) management continues to produce steady free cash flow that it methodically rotates into earnings growth, and 2) that the company's projections are reasonable estimates to work from going forward. Additional Factors Contributing To a Bullish Stance Since last reviewing the company, I have made several updates to my forward projections, which I will share here now. The following facts pattern emerges on examination. 1). Increasing returns from margin growth, capital productivity ( Note: all figures are quoted on a trailing 12-month basis unless stated otherwise). IQV's lower than industry gross margins are an indication that it prices its offerings below industry peers, and may enjoy production advantages. This is further evidenced by the higher-than-average and higher-than-median pre-tax margins of circa 14%, illustrating that it has lower operating costs than the industry average. Lower operating costs as a percentage of sales equals higher operating profits. This is the return on sales. Gross margin EBIT margin FCF Margin Industry Avg. 43.72% -28.62% -23.13% Industry Median 48.09% -4.54% 2.96% IQV 35.03% 13.96% 11.12% Click to enlarge Source: Bloomberg Curiously, the company achieves these results with a relatively low productivity rate, measured as revenue per employee . Of the industry group, the upper decile produces $462,000 per employee, with an average of $645,000 per employee, that is highly skewed by some of the data. The median revenue per employee of the life sciences tools and services industry is $306,975 (Figure 2). So IQV is in the lower percentile when it comes to revenue productivity. Figure 2. Bloomberg Finance LP, BIG Investment Calculations But when it comes to IQV's \"capital productivity\" - i.e., profits earned per $1 of capital employed - it is a different story. I mentioned last time the company's increasing returns are driven by 1) decompression of post-tax margins and 2) increasing invested capital turnover. This trend has continued in situ, as seen in Figure 3. Since December 2021, management has lifted the turnover of sales on capital from 0.72x, up to 0.78x in the last 12 months. It also added another 300 basis points of post-tax operating margin over this time. On a rolling 12-month basis, after-tax margins have lifted from 13.1% in 2021 to 16.3% in the last period. Increasing margins are a catalyst to increasing earnings, and increasing earnings are central to my bullish thesis. As a result, management has increased the return on capital invested in the business from 9.6% in 2021 to 13% in the last 12 months. This equals an incremental investment of $8.60 per share, against earnings growth of $4.20 per share, otherwise 49%, incremental return on capital. This has produced exceptional free cash flows for the company's owners, increasing from $9.70 per share three years ago to $14 per share in the trailing 12 months, 6.1% trailing free cash for yield as I write ($18. 80 share/8.2% FCF yield, including all buybacks). Figure 3. Company Filings, BIG Investments The means by which management has delivered this result is seen in Figure 4. Naturally, for a company this size and maturity, revenue growth of 1.1% each rolling 12-month period is unsurprising. What is attractive - the pre-tax margins of around 16-17%. For each new $1.00 of sales and pre-tax earnings produced over this period, the company has invested a total of $0.195 cents to get there. If we include all acquisitions - which added around 100 basis points of growth to the top line this quarter - this is a $1.10 investment per $1.00 growth in revenue. Figure 4. Company Filings, BIG Investments The increasing returns outlined earlier have been enabled management to throw off exceptional piles of free cash for the shareholders, as mentioned. This is even true after factoring in all growth and maintenance. This includes all capital expenditures required to maintain the company's competitive position and grow. Figure 5 shows the cash that is attributable to shareholders when factoring in management's \"growth investment\". Only changes in fixed assets and working capital above the maintenance capital charge are considered as growth investment. The maintenance capital charge is estimated as roughly the level of depreciation each period. I've also included buybacks distributed to shareholders here, as these 1) increase our ownership in the company without any additional investment, and 2) increase our free cash flow per share and earnings per share. As observed, the company aggressively deployed cash to growth across the 2023 period. It also returned an average of $800 million-$900 million per rolling 12-month period from 2023 up to Q1 2024 in the form of buybacks to shareholders. After all reinvestments are considered, my calculations suggest that IQV is routinely throwing off $2 billion-$3 billion of free cash flow every rolling 12-month period, whilst comfortably investing surplus cash to grow the business. I would characterize this FCF as stable and tremendously high, facts that cannot be ignored in my opinion. In terms of the ability to unlock value moving forward, this certainly is constructive. Figure 5. BIG Investments Factors Affecting Corporate Valuation IQV currently sells at 31.3x trailing earnings and 25.7x trailing pre-tax income. The questions we've got in front of ourselves now are 1) Is the company fairly valued at these multiples, 2) what is the price/value calculus + how does this relate to the risk/reward calculus, and 3) what is driving the valuation multiples? Let's compare market price to the earnings of the assets of the company. As seen in Figure 6, IQV's trailing P/E multiple has contracted sharply over the past three years. It has clamped from 39x in Q1 2022, to 31.4x last period. From 2022, it has been flat. However, earnings have increased in most quarters, from $4.95 per year up to $7.31 per share in the TTM. This divergence is quite appealing in my opinion. Since 2022, investors continue to pay a consistent P/E multiple for the company, potentially indicating their conviction. However, the denominator of the multiple - the \"E\" in earnings - has continued to rise, as the earnings multiple has remained relatively flat. Consensus is looking at 8.7% bottom-line growth in 2024. If there is no change in the P/E multiple, then the company is worth $249 to me today, with implied earnings of $7.97 per share (31.3 x $7.97 = $249). Given these recent trends in the composition of the earnings multiple, it is reasonable to expect this might continue. I will run through the various scenarios on this a little bit later. Figure 6. BIG Investments The stock also trades at 6.6x book value. This implies that management has created $6.60 in market value for every dollar of net asset value on the company's balance sheet. Whilst paying more than 6x the net tangible assets of the company is quite the ask, it does give hints to its intrinsic value, which may differ wildly from book value on any given day. Nevertheless, is important to deconstruct the return on these net assets to get the full picture. As seen below, most of the company's trailing return on equity is driven from leverage, with the 4.2x equity multiplier. Stripping leverage out of the equation, the return on tangible assets (ROE) reduces to 5.2%. Furthermore, if paying that high multiple of 6.6x, this reduces to 1.6% on a leverage-adjusted basis. The company also trades at 2.8x the value of its invested capital. The trailing return of 13% reduces to 4.5% for the investor moving forward. This is a clear testament to playing the long game with this company. These valuations are statistically high and reduce the price/value equation for the coming 12 months in my estimation. However, as I'll discuss below, this is offset by the economic value IQV management can unlock if it continues to throw off such attractive rates of earnings and free cash flow. Figure 7. BIG Investments Figure 8 consolidates my forward estimates on the company over the next five years. This is produced at the company's \"steady state\" of operations listed earlier but does not include potential acquisitions. Here, I compare the projected net operating profits after tax relative to a threshold margin of 6%, which represents the current rate of return investors can earn on \"passive money\", in other words, starting yields on investment-grade corporate bonds. Anything above this 6% return is considered economically valuable to me, and vice versa. If the company does continue along its current trajectory, making minimal changes to growth and reinvestment rates, my projections suggest it could produce $5.4 billion of economic earnings - that is, those earnings above the 6% return threshold - over this period. Discounted at a 12% discount rate, (that represents the long-term market averages, and therefore opportunity cost) I arrive at a valuation of $248 per share, in line with earlier projections. Again this illustrates why there is a large disparity in the book value of the company, that just looks at tangible assets, and the intrinsic value of the company, which discounts the surplus cash flows we could strip out of the company over the next five years. At the current market value, these economic earnings yield of 13% as I write. Figure 8. BIG Investments Finally, I've run through a number of scenarios to 1) gauge what's driving the market multiples in this instance, and 2) how sensitive the risk/reward calculus is to change in multiple vs. earnings growth. I mentioned earlier if there's no change in the current trailing multiple, and the company hits consensus growth rates of 8.7%, (earnings of $7.97 per share), this implies a valuation of $249 per share. If the multiple contracts to 28x, and the company still hits its growth rates, this implies an evaluation of $223 (Figure 9). This is a 3% decline in value from an 11% contraction in multiple, so my opinion is the risk reward calculus is stacked in our favour. Say the company does not hit its stipulated growth rates and pushes out 5% instead. If investors continue paying the same multiple, the stock could trade at $240 per share. Figure 9. BIG Investments Downside Risks To Thesis Investors must recognise the following side of risks before proceeding any further: Whilst I believe it is fundamentally justified, the company does trade at high absolute multiples (31x trailing earnings). This cannot be ignored in the context of the current market environment, one where frothy valuations are apparent. Any large contraction in the healthcare sector P/E multiple could be a downside risk to the company, therefore. Both management and Wall Street analysts are projecting a reasonable period of growth for the company over the next 3 year period. This is likely priced in at the current multiples in my view, and therefore, any revision to these estimates could be a factor investors might want to consider. It would also be wise to factor in the fundamental drivers of the broad market in this analysis. This includes earnings growth, economic growth, valuations, and money flow. Any change to these variables, particularly on the economic growth side, may impact equities in general and therefore nullify this thesis. Investors should realise these risks before proceeding any further. In Short IQV presents as a quality large-cap healthcare play with attractive fundamental economics by my analysis. This includes the company's increasing post-tax margins, increasing capital efficiency, and exceptional free cash flow production that it throws off and reinvests successfully to produce supplementary earnings growth. It is not unreasonable to expect these trends to continue, and for the company to continue doing what it has done for the last 3 to 5 years in a very similar fashion. Based on this view, I get to a valuation of $248 per share in my base case, and in the worst-case scenario, the stock is worth roughly what I would pay for it today, which is an excellent margin of safety in my opinion.

        "description": "North Vancouver RCMP say a man attacked a stranger and damaged cars with a knife in broad daylight",
        "content": "A North Vancouver man has been charged with attempted murder after an alleged knife attacked on a stranger in Deep Cove on Saturday. Shortly after 3 p.m. on May 25, police responded to reports of a man slashing cars and attacking a motorcyclist near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road, North Vancouver RCMP said in a release on Monday. The man allegedly struck the biker’s helmet with a knife, narrowly avoiding injury but causing him to fall and sustain minor injuries as a result, the release said. The motorcyclist was led to safety by a driver at the scene. Numerous officers arrived and took the man into custody, where he went on to allegedly assault a police officer, said North Vancouver RCMP. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak of the North Vancouver RCMP. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passing motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said anyone who may have been affected by the attack can contact the RCMP’s Victim Services Unit, 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 604-969-7540. “We want you to know we are here, we will listen and we will support you,” he said. Any witnesses who have not already come forward are urged to contact the police at 604-985-1311, and quote file #24-10135. District of North Vancouver Mayor Mike Little, who resides in Deep Cove, issued a statement on Sunday evening describing the event as a “really upsetting incident” for the community. “It could have been much worse without the quick action of a passing motorist and the speedy response from our local RCMP officers,” he said. “I am grateful to everyone who was involved in the response in Deep Cove on Saturday.” On Sunday, Alexander Currie of North Vancouver was charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault on a police officer, and possession of a weapon. He was due to appear in court May 27. Mina Kerr-Lazenby is the North Shore News’ Indigenous and civic affairs reporter. This reporting beat is made possible by the Local Journalism Initiative .

Finn came home from \"picking up pizza,\" which he did, that he also witnessed his birth mother Sheila and now step-father, Deacon, get married. Hope was also at the wedding and convinced Finn to attend for the sake of their parents. Steffy questioned Finn on his whereabouts after he admitted that his phone was on silent when she tried to reach him. As Finn was attempting to explain how he accidentally walked into Deacon and Sheila's wedding while picking up pizza, Steffy's phone rings and she sees a picture of Deacon, Hope, Sheila and Finn from the wedding. Steffy was upset when she noticed that he was standing next to Sheila. She kept repeating the words, \"Oh my gosh.\" Finn tried to explain to her that he was telling the truth despite how the pictures looked. Viewers hopped on X, formerly known as Twitter, and feel like Finn will be getting what he deserves from Steffy. One person wrote: \"Divorce incoming #BoldandBeautiful.\" Another person wrote: \"Finn is going to be on a big timeout now. #boldandbeautiful.\" A third person wrote: \"Dump his idiot a-- he shut a note to watch. This woman little tried to kill u both and yet he still don’t get why Steffy don’t want her around.. he will find out soon enough #BoldandBeautiful.\" What Steffy does not know is that Finn was guilted by Hope and Sheila into staying. Steffy has made it clear to Finn that she did not want him to have any relationship with Sheila after she tried to kill her. Steffy \"killed\" Sheila as she was defending herself but later found out that Sheila was, indeed, alive. Steffy is also not a big fan of Hope and vice versa. Hope dated Steffy's brother, Thomas, who left town after Hope denied his proposal. Viewers have been awaiting this split between Steffy and Finn and believe that he will end up with Hope, who is now his step-sister.",

        "content": "Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images The Eagles-Cowboys rivalry is among the fiercest in the NFL. The fanbases can't stand each other, and in some cases, the animosity extends over to the players themselves. For 13 seasons, Jason Kelce battled the Cowboys twice a year as a member of the Eagles. This year, he will have to cover two Dallas games as part of ESPN's Monday Night Countdown. During the newest episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast with brother Travis, Jason was asked how he'll handle the responsibility of discussing his former team's most-hated rival. “Oh, I have no bias,” Jason explained, via Awful Announcing . “I just don’t like them. But I’m gonna give them their props. There’s a rivalry, but the reality is, even though I hate the Cowboys’ fanbase...I was at a charity golf outing, and there was a kid, and he was like, ‘Hey, I’m a Cowboys fan.’ I was like, ‘Oh, are you from Dallas?’ And he said, ‘No, I’m from Philadelphia.’ Are you a Lakers and a Yankees fan, too? Like, what are we doing? We’re just picking whatever team we want; that’s where we’re at?\" Jason added that he'll be able to \"set aside my differences as a player and the competition,\" but then Travis interrupted him to call him out for being a Pittsburgh Steelers fan growing up in Cleveland. “I had to; we didn’t have a team,” Jason explained. “We lost our team. The next closest team was the Pittsburgh Steelers, geographically, and I loved Jerome Bettis. I couldn’t keep being a Browns fan when they went to be the Ravens. There wasn’t a team to root for, Travis... the moment the Browns came back, I got a Tim Couch jersey, and I was rocking Tim Couch. I still loved Jerome Bettis, but I was no longer a Steelers fan once the Browns came back.” Kelce will work two Dallas home games on Monday Night Football , starting Week 11 against the Houston Texans. He'll be back at Jerry World in Week 14 when the Cowboys host the Cincinnati Bengals. It will be interesting to see the kind of reception he gets from Dallas fans when on assignment. Our guess is there will be some booing and good-natured taunting, but a mutual respect will outweigh any concerns over the Cowboys-Eagles rivalry.",

        "content": "By Vijay Prashad* In early April 2024, the navies of four countries — Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States — held a maritime exercise in the South China Sea. Australia’s Warramunga, Japan’s Akebono, the Philippines’ Antonio Luna, and the United States’ Mobile worked together in these waters to strengthen their joint abilities and — as they said in a joint statement — to “uphold the right to freedom of navigation and overflight and respect for maritime rights under international law.” A few weeks later, between April 22 and May 8, ships from the Philippines and the United States operated alongside Australian and French naval troops for Exercise Balikatan 2024 . Australia’s Richard Marles, Japan’s Kihara Minoru, the Philippines’ Gilberto Teodoro, and the United States’ Lloyd Austin met for their second meeting to discuss their collaboration in the region that they call the Indo-Pacific. It was at the edges of this meeting that the public relations teams of these ministers began to float the term “Squad” to refer to these four countries. While they did not formally announce the creation of a new bloc in East Asia, this new nickname intends to provide a de facto announcement of its existence. In 2007, the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States met in Manila (Philippines) to establish the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad) while their militaries conducted Exercise Malabar in the Philippines Sea. The Quad did not initially include the Philippines, whose President at the time — Gloria Arroyo — was trying to improve relations between her country and China. The Quad did not develop because Australia’s Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was unhappy with Washington’s growing belligerence towards Beijing. Over the course of the past two years, the United States has been frustrated with India’s discomfort with the kind of pressure campaign that the U.S. has been mounting against China and Russia. India refused to stop buying discounted Russian energy, which was a pragmatic decision during an election period (although India’s purchase of Russian energy has declined over time). The U.S. attempt to make Taiwan into the frontline of its pressure campaign has not borne fruit either. In April 2024, former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte recalled that when he was president (2016-2022), “there was no quarrel. We can return to normalcy. I hope that we can stop the ruckus over there because the Americans are the ones pushing the Philippine government to go out there and find a quarrel and eventually maybe start a war.”",

        "content": "Josh is joined by Sophie Walker on this week's episode of the Sky Sports Golf podcast to reflect on the tragic news of Grayson Murray's death, before previewing the US Women's Open and hearing from Eddie Pepperell in a wide-ranging interview. It was announced over the weekend that two-time PGA Tour winner Murray passed away on Saturday after withdrawing late in his second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge on Friday. Murray's family confirmed in a statement that the 30-year-old had taken his own life after previously speaking openly about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. \"Everybody thinks that professional golf is the best job in the world, just because you've got all the stuff, all the money, all the trophies, life must be good right? Sometimes it's not and it's a battle in your own mind,\" said Sophie Walker. \"Maybe listening to some of the stuff he said some of us might have thought he'd won that battle, but I don't think you ever do. It's a constant thing and it makes me so sad he was that low. \"It's horrible to think that's your only option.\" Tributes have poured in from across the world of golf as the sport remembers the influence of Murray, who has previously taken time to open himself up to messages from others who might have been struggling with their mental health. \"I often say, some of the lads I've played with, when I see them on the course on Tour they look like super men,\" said Walker. \"Their clothes are fresh out of the packet, their shoes, they walk around and look six foot five etc, but you're trying to put on a show for yourself in order to be as confident as possible. \"There's nothing quite like not playing well and going back to a hotel room alone and being left with your own thoughts. \"Pro golfers I think speak quite negatively to themselves at the best of times, and you would never say what you say to yourself to somebody else. \"When things are going well your phone blows up, when they aren't it's a really quiet place.\" You can listen to more by downloading the latest Sky Sports podcast via Spotify , Spreaker or Apple Podcasts .

Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:56 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh EDMONTON — Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won't face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province's law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. \"(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips' data,\" reads the letter, dated May 17. \"The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service's) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.\" The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. \"(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,\" the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name \"Mike Corps,\" which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk's offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

        "content": "The Imo State Command of the Nigeria Police has confirmed the rank demotion of one of its officers caught extorting money from motorists along the Owerri-Onitsha express road. The officer, identified as Inspector Isong Osudueh, was captured in a viral video collecting money from drivers on the busy road and, in some cases, handing them change. The officer’s extortion video, attached to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), has continued to generate criticism from social media users, with many condemning the act in its entirety. Reacting to the development on Monday, the Imo State Commissioner of Police, Aboki Danjuma, described the act as shameful and unprofessional. In a statement made available by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Henry Okoye, CP Danjuma stated that the demotion became important to maintain his officers’ highest professionalism. ALSO READ: Two feared killed in Lagos Police station attack The statement also revealed that the supervisory officer in charge of monitoring the activities of the erring officer was issued an official query for lack of supervision. The Imo State Commissioner of Police, however, enjoined the state’s residents not to relent in their efforts to continuously support the police and other security agencies with timely information. The statement partly reads, “The disciplinary actions taken against the erring officer underscore the Command’s unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest standards of professionalism, transparency, and integrity among its personnel while effectively discharging its lawful duties and entrenching public trust and confidence. “While strongly condemning the embarrassing act, the Commissioner of Police, CP Aboki Danjuma, reiterates that the Command under his watch will not condone any act of extortion or misconduct by its personnel and warns that any supervisory officer who fails to carry out his oversight duties will be severely sanctioned.”",

        "description": "There is a growing number of Brits exploring relationships involving multiple partners. One couple have told the Mirror how their open marriage works for them",
        "content": "Hacking on an industrial scale exposed the personal details of 30 million users of the Ashley Madison dating site for married people looking to cheat - resulting in heartbreak, divorce and even suicide. But neither the 2015 hack, nor the new Netflix docuseries, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal, examining the subsequent fall-out, have dampened its customers' ardour. Now, nine years after the personal data became public, Ashley Madison - described as “only for married people” and claiming to be “the first married dating website” - has millions of customers. It also welcomes people in “open relationships’ like husband-and-wife Chu Nim and Su Perez, who completely understand the allure of extra-marital sex - although they never cheat. The super glam couple have an open marriage The pair have been married for years ( Image: Collect) Instead, the London-based parents, who met on the dancefloor of the Liquid & Envy nightclub in Romford, Essex, in 2008, juggle kids, work, sex parties and throuples...together. Chu, 37, tells the Mirror : \"One night we were out, really drunk, and a friend stayed over. We were like ‘Should we bring this person in?’ “Obviously, it was very scary at the time. The funny thing was we hadn’t even spoken to this person, they were oblivious.” According to Chu, everyone was in the bedroom when he suddenly asked their friend if he wanted to sleep with his wife. “They didn’t think it was real until we made it real,” he says. Su, 44, adds: “It was just me getting involved. There was no sexual connection between the two men, it was just me with them. “It went really well. The morning was awkward, he went out and brought us breakfast! “But it didn’t change anything about us or our friendship.” Away from their unorthodox sex life, the couple look after their 12-year-old son and Su’s 23-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. She is disabled and Su is her carer, as well as being an events manager, while Chu is a manager at a private jet business. The pair say it strengthens their relationship ( Image: Collect) Chu and Su discussed it for years before going ahead - and say communication is key ( Image: Collect) They both say that sleeping with other people strengthens their connection and keeps their sex life sizzling. Enjoying an open marriage by mutual consent, without any deception, they say they don’t need Ashley Madison. The couple, whose first sexual experience as a throuple was in 2018, generally sleep with another woman. When they involve another man, he makes love to Su, but not to Chu. “Chu always says he just likes me enjoying myself and having pleasure. He doesn’t get involved, but it works for us,” says Su. In a practice known as “unicorn hunting” - when a usually heterosexual couple seeks a third and generally bisexual female partner to join a threesome - they normally involve a woman. Despite their unconventional marriage, their courtship was fairly standard, with Su saying of their first meeting: “I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe something happened. They used to be very traditional “Then we just kept bumping into each other and we moved quickly. We became friends really quickly and I think that's the basis of any relationship - we’re best friends.” The pair held a Chinese marriage service in 2011, the day before Valentine’s Day, attended by friends and family. They then officially registered their nuptials two years ago, after marrying again in Las Vegas. For several years they were quite traditional, with Su making Chu promise not to visit any strip clubs in Amsterdam on his stag do. She says: “I literally said ‘I only have one condition - do not go to the strip clubs.’ “The way I saw it was that if you’ve found the one, I should be the one forever. You shouldn’t even need to look anywhere else.” When Chu was “dragged” to a sex show - but not a strip club - on his stag night, Su threatened to call off their big day, before cooling down. But everything changed two years later when they started visiting Miami for work. Su says: “The sex culture there is very big - especially in the clubs. One of the first nights, we went with some friends to a strip club and I remember saying ‘Enjoy yourself but respect me.’” Chu adds: “Su made it really clear to me from the get-go and I really understood. It’s not about the girls, it’s about how I make her feel in that scenario. “We can be very comfortable and say ‘that girl is beautiful’ or ‘that man looks amazing’, but you need to have a foundation of understanding.” On one Miami trip, the pair shared a private lap dance and “the penny dropped”, says Su, as she watching her husband’s reaction. They first explored their fantasies in Miami ( Image: Collect) Su was fuming when Chu attended a sex show in Amsterdam “It was very sensual,” she says. “I enjoyed watching him enjoy it, and he enjoyed me enjoying it. And it progressed to us fantasising about situations.” But boundaries are key. They discuss everything before involving other people. “I think you can get very lost in the moment and think ‘let’s just do it’ but it’s not necessarily the right move,” says Su. Looking back at the night in Miami, Chu adds: “There was lots of discussion - ‘is it just a fantasy, do we want to make it real?’” And when they eventually invited a woman to join them, Su says there was a “completely different dynamic” in the bedroom. “The first time, it was just me, but the second time we were both involved.” Watching Chu make love to another woman didn’t make her jealous. She says: “For me, it’s about making me feel that I’m there. That even if he’s having sex with another woman, I’m the most important person in the room. I need to be present.” The extra-marital activity bonds them more than threatening their relationship, according to Su, who adds: “It brings you closer together. You enjoy each other in a very different way.” Meanwhile, Chu admits that enjoying intimacy with two women is “amazing.” He says: “If someone does something wrong, we sit down and we make sure it doesn’t happen again. “Obviously, boundaries can be blurred, especially in the heat of the moment, as there’s a different part of the brain making decisions.” It has helped discovering that friends they already had are, in fact, swingers. Chu says: “We thought it was just us. The pair have enjoyed sex parties before - but prefer to be a bit more selective “By absolute happenstance, some of our closest friends that we’ve known for 20 years are swingers.” And while they haven’t ruled sex parties out, they have been enjoying more intimate encounters like those described. Chu says: “There’s different types of open relationships. We don’t play separately, it’s all about being together. “So, we’ve been moving back to our own kind of thing, using certain websites, and even escorts. Just to make life easy.” Understanding each other’s needs is of paramount importance before an open relationship can work, according to Su. And when Chu, who is gregarious, organised some “hook-ups” and she felt left out, she told him. She says: “I realised it wasn’t making me comfortable, that I needed it to be on my terms. I needed to give the all-clear. “You’re still a couple and a family. It’s all about enhancing parts of your life.” These days, when they’re in the mood for a third person, they might call on a friend to join them. But they’ve managed to form lasting friendships with some people they have enjoyed casual sex with. Despite their openness, they do exercise caution when talking to other people about their open marriage. Chu says: “If people ask, I’ll never lie, but I’m not mentioning it in the office.” Similarly, they don’t advertise their unconventional sex life to their children - although they say they will answer age-appropriate questions if asked. The pair say there's a lot of incorrect assumptions about open relationships out there And Su is keen to dispel the image of people looking for three-way sex being kinky, “old and wrinkly.” She says: “It’s a massive misconception that everyone in this world is old and wrinkly and an exhibitionist. “There are a lot of young trendy people. Unfortunately, not a lot of people understand it. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for us. “A lot of people think that if you do this with somebody else it's because you're not happy in your marriage. “I completely disagree. I think the happier you are in a marriage, the easier it is to do this, as you trust each other.” Classified site, Vivastreet , connects people with casual encounters and more Shoppers say £19 wrinkle-filling cream gives ‘amazing’ results on fine lines in four days",

        "content": "Clive Myrie's Adventures in the Caribbean: Clive attempts walking on stilts Fans usually see Clive Myrie reporting from the heart of the conflict in Ukraine , or on the BBC news desk, so his latest travel series exploring his Caribbean roots was a million miles away from his usual persona. Although there were tearful moments as his sister opened up about childhood trauma, there were also light-hearted ones when he could scarcely stop smiling - and viewers got to see his nervous grin as he attempted to stand on stilts. The first episode of Clive Myrie's Caribbean Adventure saw the BBC star visiting a remote Jamaican mountain community to learn more about their war with the British army. While there, he was astounded to meet a group charging around on stilts, including \"out and proud queer performance artist\" Simone. In a country which still criminalises sex between men and where LGBT people are known to experience homophobic attacks, she has declared her intention to \"stand tall\" - and her stilts are the perfect symbolism of that. However, she faces considerable challenges, with Time Magazine suggesting back in 2006 that Jamaica was \"the most homophobic place on Earth\". She introduced Clive to her culture, inviting him to stand up on stilts himself. \"I feel like a baby giraffe trying to walk for the first time!\" He exclaimed, as he attempted to stand straight. He wasn't quite confident enough to attempt a full walk, and seemed reluctant to let go of a group member's hands and risk swaying perilously on his own. However, there were no hard feelings as Simone told him: \"Thank you for trying and for trusting us as much as you did!\" READ MORE: Rylan Clark collaboration teased by BBC's Clive Myrie as he hits the red carpet [LATEST] Clive Myrie's Caribbean Adventure saw the BBC star attempt to walk on stilts (Image: BBC) Clive also learnt the more serious side to the culture as she recalled how her mountain community ancestors had fought against the British Army, eventually resulting in them winning freedom. The Maroons descend from Africans who were able to defeat the shackles of slavery after years of Spanish - and then British rule. Their hero, Nanny, is a formidable icon in Jamaican culture as she is thought to have given out the military training which helped her people triumph in the war. Clive suggested her pride meant that she refused to sign the treaty that would have granted them freedom, but it was ultimately signed anyway. Don't miss...

Read our Privacy Policy Clive Myrie had an emotional reunion with his sister too (Image: BBC) His experience on stilts was far from the only eye-opening adventure Clive had as he retraced his Jamaican roots. He also reunited with his sister, who'd been left behind by their parents when they moved to Britain as part of the Windrush Generation. She'd eventually moved to the UK too, but recently returned to Jamaica with her husband - and she was moved to tears as she and Clive had a heart-to-heart about her childhood \"trauma\" and experience with \"horrendous\" schooling in Britain. He visited a coffee plantation in the Blue Mountains, before heading to Boston Bay - the birthplace of authentic jerk chicken - to try his hand at home-cooking. Clive also headed to the Great Huts eco-tourism resort, where he was provided with a treehouse room and guided to one of the most breathtaking beauty spots in the country - although, understandably, he was reticent about the idea of jumping from a height into the sea. All episodes of Clive Myrie's Caribbean Adventure are available to view now via BBC iPlayer.

        "content": "Game 3 of the NBA Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Minnesota Timberwolves was a star-studded affair. The offensive core of the Chiefs- Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the new wideout Hollywood Brown graced the game as Mavs defeated Wolves, 116-107, going up 3-0 in the series. NBA posted a picture with the superstars in attendance at the American Airlines Stadium. However, many fans noticed the same thing as the Chiefs trio posed for a snap. Fans quickly pointed out an unknown man in the background, photobombing the pic. Even with the presence of the NFL royalty, that unknown man and his big smile stole the show. The moment will forever live in the memory of this fan who became famous overnight. Fans were overjoyed to see him taking full advantage of the opportunity. Many suggested that he use viral pictures as his profile pictures on every social media platform. A fan joked that his famous picture would help his dating life. Few speculated that he could high net-worth individual if he is sitting behind the Chiefs stars on those floor seats. Fans said, Another chimed in and added, A fan wrote, A user quipped, People even speculated his net worth since he was sitting in the high-end, extremely unaffordable seats: And some fans were mesmerized by the unknown phenomenon’s confidence: Dallas Mavericks is the only team Patrick passionately supports as a Texas native. Even though he started out as a Cowboys fan, he quickly pivoted to other franchises once he entered the NFL. Patrick Mahomes Shows Relentless Support For Dallas Mavericks Mahomes is a legend in Texas, having grown up and played college ball in the state. Even though he spends most of his time in Kansas, his heart still lives in Texas and doesn’t forego any opportunity to show his support for the local sports teams. It’s not a secret that he, like many in that part of the country, grew up supporting the Cowboys and even dreamed of playing for America’s Team. However, being the shot-caller for the Chiefs, he can no longer show the same level of passion that he showed growing up. So, supporting other Texas teams like the Mavericks, Texas Rangers, and the Dallas Stars is the next best thing for him. Mahomes is not shy about showing his passion for those teams during the matches. He still attends his alma mater Texas Tech games and the Whitehouse High School team. While the Chiefs plan to stay in Kansas City for at least another 6 years, there was speculation that Clark Hunt might be open to moving the franchise to another part of the country and Dallas was touted as a possible destination. The Chiefs had links to Dallas, having started as Dallas Texans. It will be interesting to see which team the local fans will support if the defending champions ever move back to Texas.",

        "content": "In recent weeks, GIFs sent by iPhone users to Android devices running Google Messages have turned into distorted still images with missing dots/pixels throughout. This issue — with reports continuing to come in — has been encountered on Pixel, Samsung, and other Android phones. All the GIFs have been sent over SMS/MMS by iPhone owners. While more than a few Android users have reported this issue, not every iPhone-Android conversation is impacted. GIFs we sent in testing today appear normally in Google Messages. Meanwhile, one case described how they had this problem but other Android users in the same group chat received GIFs from iPhone owners without issue. Credit: u/Diiiiirty, u/ForwardMotion6565 Given the wide range of devices and carriers, it’s unlikely to be an Android OS issue. It could be a problem with the Google Messages app, but we have yet to find Android-to-Android instances. As such, iOS is the most likely culprit. A compression or rendering bug might be at fault. Reports about this distorted iPhone GIF issue increased in mid-May , though some Android users say it has been happening for a few weeks before that. One thing worth noting is how Apple released iOS 17.5 on May 13 , with beta testing starting on April 2 . This issue comes ahead of Apple’s work to adopt RCS on the iPhone. We’re expecting it to launch later this year . The first beta of iOS 18 should arrive next month at WWDC 2024, but it’s unclear if RCS will be enabled on those first previews.

        "description": "The experienced Red Storm finished atop Class A South, thanks to shutdown pitching and an improved offense.",
        "content": "SCARBOROUGH — A year ago, the Scarborough High baseball team’s season ended abruptly. A Class A South quarterfinal loss to No. 6 Marshwood left the higher-seeded Red Storm disappointed. Despite being beaten by top-tier pitcher Noah Fitzgerald, the good feeling from an 11-5 regular season and a third-place place finish in A South evaporated after they failed to advance in the postseason. This year feels different. Scarborough finished the regular season 15-1, winning its eighth straight game on Saturday, a 12-0 decision over Portland at Hadlock Field. The Red Storm will likely enter the Class A South playoffs as the No. 1 seed. Scarborough is also poised to have an 11-day break between its regular-season finale and the regional quarterfinals on June 6. “Last year, we were all young. That’s part of the reason we fell short last year,” said Tyler Archambault, a slick-fielding senior shortstop. “This year, we’re all older. We’ve been playing together since we were 10 years old. We’ve all grown together. It took last year to all grow together at the varsity level. This year, we’re all more mature. Bigger, stronger and mentally more mature, as well.” A post shared by Varsity Maine (@varsity.maine) Scarborough lost only one player from its 2023 team, Coach Wes Ridlon said, adding that team expectations didn’t change – “Finish in the top four.” One effect of last year’s early playoff exit was that Scarborough, despite all its returning players and a deep pitching staff, wasn’t tabbed as the favorite entering this season. That distinction went to Falmouth (13-3), which is second in the standings. “I think people definitely thought that we would be in the mix, in the middle of the pack. I don’t think anyone thought we would be where we are,” said junior Erik Swenson, the staff ace. “But I credit it to my coaches. We have a great team, we have a strong team.” The Red Storm have won close games. They have come from behind. They have handled many teams with ease. The one setback came to Deering (5-10), and they nearly recovered from a 7-0 first-inning deficit in that one, losing 8-7. Scarborough’s success starts with its pitching. Swenson, who has verbally committed to pitch for the University of Maine, is 5-0 with one save. He recently beat his future Black Bear teammate, Falmouth senior Brennan Rumpf, in a 2-1 pitchers’ duel . Swenson has struck out 58 over 31 2/3 innings, and compiled a 0.66 ERA. Scarborough’s Matthew Fallona gets a hit in the fourth inning to drive in the winning run in a May 16 game against Falmouth. Derek Davis/Staff Photographer Zak Sanders has stepped in as the No. 2 starter after an injury to senior Harrison Griffiths. Sanders is 3-0 with three saves and a 0.78 ERA. He has 34 strikeouts and six walks over 27 innings. Sophomore Ryan Shugars (4-0, 0.56 ERA), senior right-hander Mason Porter and sophomore righty Nate Masters have contributed to the team’s 0.86 ERA. Opponents are hitting just .167 against the Red Storm. “Our staff is very effective because we throw strikes and we mix up speeds with efficiency,” Sanders said. “First-pitch strikes and getting people to make outs, not necessarily strikeouts.” Scarborough’s improved offense emphasizes batters reaching base. In a 12-1 mercy-rule shortened victory over Windham on May 21, the Red Storm had seven hits over four innings (as the home team, they did not need to bat in the fifth). But they had 19 baserunners, thanks to walks, hit-batsmen and defensive errors. Ridlon said he and his staff stress the value of hitting hard ground balls. On grounders, the defense has to field the ball, throw the ball and catch the throw, as opposed to a fly ball, “when all they have to do is catch it for an out.” Matthew Fallona is hitting .432 and leads the team in hits (19) and RBI (16). Mason Porter (.326, 14 RBI, team-best five extra-base hits), Archambault (.321), Sanders (.348, team-high 23 runs), and left-fielder Patrick McCue (.297, 14 RBI) have also contributed to a team that is hitting .288 overall. Even better, the Red Storm’s on-base percentage is .410. McCue (.518), Porter (.492), Fallona (.491) and Sanders (.455) lead the club in OBP. Once on base, Scarborough goes into attack mode. “That’s definitely our image. We like to put pressure on people as early as possible on the base paths,” Porter said. “Especially if there’s a pitcher we see is struggling a little bit, as much pressure as we can put on the base paths as possible is what we like to do.” Sometimes Scarborough runs into outs. In the first inning of the Windham game, Sanders scored on a wild pitch. Ridlon then waved home Fallona from second base on the same play. Fallona, however, was out by a couple feet to end the inning. “We love the hyper-aggressive base running,” Archambault said. “We love to put stress on teams and we love to take the extra bags we can, even if that means we get thrown out sometimes. “We figure at this level, we can get more runs that way than outs, and it’s worked pretty well for us the last two years.” Success.

        "content": "Three years after an announcement that made headlines around the world and prompted new conversations about reconciliation, the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc band says details about the ongoing investigation into what are believed to be unmarked burial sites are being kept top secret. That’s what Kukpi7 Rosanne Casimir said in a statement on Monday, the third anniversary of the announcement of the findings of a ground-penetrating radar survey of the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School. On May 27, 2021, the band issued a news release detailing the findings of a ground-penetrating radar survey taken on the grounds of the former school four days earlier. The initial release said as many as 215 unmarked graves had been located on the property. The band was early on. “Three years later, we remain steadfast in our sacred duty as guardians to the missing children from the Kamloops Indian Residential School,” Casimir said in the statement. “From the beginning, we have articulated and exercised our jurisdiction. The investigation continues to be carried out in compliance with Secwepemc laws, legal traditions, worldviews, values and protocols.” Casimir said details about the investigation are being kept secret for the time being. “Our investigative findings and investigative steps are currently being kept confidential to preserve the integrity of the investigation,” she said. “Our investigators’ findings to date are consistent with the presence of unmarked burials.” Casimir said the investigation has included archival and documentary research and analysis, truth telling with Kamloops Indian Residential School survivors and archeological and anthropological surveys and studies. “Potential DNA and other forensic methods” is also listed. Casimir also urged allies to “refute the very real harm caused by denialists.” She said band leaders knew there would be pushback before the initial announcement was made. “There have always been those who target Indigenous people in Canada, with systemic racism and white supremacy as foundational to Canada as the very federal laws that ripped our children away from home, in cattle trucks and police cars, to bring them to residential schools,” she said. The Kamloops Indian Residential School operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government assumed control and ran the facility as a day school for another nine years. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s final report in 2016 detailed the harsh mistreatment of students at Canadian residential schools, where at least 3,200 children died amid abuse and neglect. News of the Tk’emlups announcement in 2021 prompted similar investigations at other former residential schools, and more recently .",

        "content": "Cannes security guard, previously embroiled in a dispute with Kelly Rowland, is now accused of disrespecting Korean actress Yoona. The K-pop star-turned-actress was reportedly halted from posing for red carpet photos on the iconic Cannes stairs by the same security guard. This incident follows closely on the heels of the confrontation with Rowland, where the Destiny's Child alum hinted at racial bias. While the guard's colleagues defended her actions as simply 'doing her job,' fans uncovered another video showcasing Yoona receiving similar treatment. Despite her composed demeanor, her facial expressions betrayed her evident discomfort and annoyance as she was escorted away from the stairs by the female staffer. In the latest developments at the Cannes Filmd Festival, the controversy surrounding the behavior of a particular security guard has escalated, drawing attention to alleged instances of disrespect towards celebrities and attendees. Among the incidents that have sparked widespread criticism, a Ukrainian model found herself in a heated altercation with the same guard, resulting in an expulsion from the red carpet. The model, visibly determined to reclaim her place on the iconic Cannes stairs, engaged in a physical confrontation with the worker. Furthermore, Massiel Taveras, a Dominican actress, became embroiled in a similar clash with the female guard in question, echoing the confrontational atmosphere.",

        "content": "ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has fired back after being called out by an NBA Hall of Famer. Two-time NBA champion Isiah Thomas called out Smith on social media after he criticized Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown on First Take . The Celtics are currently knee-deep in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers , with Brown and Co. leading the series 3-0. Following their 133-128 Game 1 win, Smith took to First Take to share a brutal note he'd been sent by \"an NBA source\" regarding Brown - who was recently controversially snubbed from the All-Star lineups. \"It's not so much that he's underrated; it's that he's just not liked because of his 'I-am-better-than-you attitude,'\" Smith said. \"He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be.\" Thomas, however, was far from impressed with this take, taking to X, formerly known as Twitter , to defend the 27-year-old. \"I have been a friend, mentor and advisor to @FCHWPO since he was a student at UC Berkeley he is 100 percent marketable and before you slander his name @stephenasmith tell your source to put their name on it or don't speak on it,\" Thomas said . \"Let it be known.\" But Smith also wasn't going to take this criticism lying down, also taking to X to reply to Thomas. \"I have no idea what you're talking about @IsiahThomas,\" he said . \"I have been a fan of Jaylen Brown for years. Still am. What’s unfortunate is that you — who's known for me decades — would choose to go on X to expressed whatever dissent you feel instead of calling me directly. \"But I get it. It's a pattern several folks have used vs me recently, suddenly forgetting communication we've always had. \"So be it. I root for JB always—a great dude and player. But the @celtics have to close the deal.\" As for Brown, he too took to X to respond to Smith , calling on him to \"State your source.\" Smith, though, could not be convinced. He replied saying simply, \"That's not happening. It's journalism. Not revealing sources. Smith then went on to note that later in the aforementioned First Take segment , he and Kendrick Perkins both disagreed with the source. \"The point we were actually discussing is how under appreciated you are and why that may be, which is why I read the quote,\" he added. \"I even brought up how socially conscious you are, and how that may not be liked, knowing you're a good brother. STEPHEN A. Smith is now the face of ESPN and an executive producer on First Take having initially started working for the company back in 2003. Smith has held various roles with the network, including hosting radio shows, SportsCenter contributions, and appearing on NBA Countdown. He was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1994 to 2010. His began as an NBA writer before becoming a general sports columnist. Before that, Smith worked as a reporter with Winston-Salem Journal, the Greensboro News, and the New York Daily News. \"Also, that you're a $300M man and you deserve it. But that doesn't mean naysayers don't get heard. That comes with the territory.\" Regardless of who said what, Brown has been impressive as usual during the Conference Finals. In three games he has averaged 30 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists. The Celtics will now have the opportunity to complete the sweep on Monday at 8pm ET. And as for the beef between Smith and Thomas, the latter has attempted to settle the situation in a later tweet. \"All love between you and I @stephenasmith let's talk when time permits,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"Tell your source to stand on their words and not use you to throw their stones.\"",

The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.\" A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. \"We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. \"He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, 'I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "If you are a deeply unpopular incumbent president facing a stern uphill challenge in a bid for re-election (not unlike President Joe Biden) you would like to hit a couple public relations home runs en route to the general election. In lieu of home runs, which can certainly be tough to come by in this hyper-partisan political climate, the next best thing actually isn’t hitting singles or doubles — it’s just avoiding glaring errors. Thanks to a viral Memorial Day clip, the already- Joe Biden now finds himself trying to stave off such an error. As noted, Biden spoke Monday at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, as most presidents are wont to do on Memorial Day. And believe it or not, there was little issue with what Biden actually said during his speech. “Freedom has never been guaranteed — every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many,” Biden told those in attendance. “It matters. Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It’s the very soul of America.” Cool. Anyways, the real issue for Biden came up when a viral clip began circulating that showed the president ... less than energized. Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?? — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) “Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?” The Post Millennial asked while sharing a clip of “ Joe.” To answer that outlet’s question: No, it doesn’t appear like Biden was asleep at the wheel (well, ) during this Memorial Day service. It really does look like Biden was closing his eyes in “prayer,” or at least solemn remembrance, for the men and women who’ve given their lives in service to this great country. But the issue isn’t so much the truth of the matter (it’s impossible to tell if he was actually dozing off or not, given Biden appears to generally move at a ), so much as it’s the optics of the matter. It’s that Joe Biden was falling asleep during this moment of remembrance because that’s what 81-year-old men do after anything remotely physically or mentally taxing. They nap. And that’s a generally big problem for Biden. The man could fix the economy and cure cancer tonight, but the fact won’t change that there will always be people dubious of the man’s ability to perform due to the biological realities of aging. And yes, Biden’s chief political rival, former President Donald Trump, isn’t exactly a spring chicken either, but you can’t deny the sheer between the two men. Because of those biological realities, Biden has to outperform expectations to overcome questions about his age. He’s obviously not accomplishing that, if is to be believed. And that’s the real problem with the viral clip of Biden “napping.” Perception shapes reality, and the perception of Biden being a doddering, sleepy old fool very much feels like reality. The president would do well to avoid these types of snafus — even innocent ones like this — if he wants any shot of a second term. (Hah.)

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a weather alert at 3:44 p.m. on Monday for strong thunderstorms until 4:15 p.m. for Otsego and Delaware counties. Residents may experience wind gusts of up to 50 mph. \"At 3:43 p.m., Doppler radar tracked strong thunderstorms along a line extending from Middlefield to near Delhi. Movement was northeast at 40 mph,\" says the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Delhi, Davenport, Worcester, Middlefield, Maryland, Kortright, Meredith, Hamden, Stamford and Westford. According to the weather service, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 9 p.m. for central New York.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of swollen waterways: Maintain safe driving distances: Reduce speed and drive cautiously: Choose your lane wisely: Prioritize visibility Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road.

        "description": "Attorneys get one last chance to make their case to 12 jurors in Manhattan before deliberations begin this week",
        "content": "A verdict in Donald Trump ’s hush money trial could arrive as soon as Wednesday. Closing arguments in the former president’s criminal trial in Manhattan begin on Tuesday, and Manhattan prosecutors and Mr Trump’s defense team are expected to spend the day delivering their final statements to the jury before deliberations begin. Then, after 16 days of testimony from 22 witnesses spread out over five weeks, a group of 12 jurors in Manhattan will determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of falsifying business records as part of a conspiracy to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election . Jurors will review dozens of documents, including emails, text messages, encrypted chats and the allegedly false documents at the center of the case. Those include company ledger entries, invoices and checks that form the paper trail of Mr Trump’s reimbursement payments to his former attorney Michael Cohen , who paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels weeks before Election Day so she wouldn’t go public with a story about having sex with Mr Trump. On Sunday , near the end of his six-day break between trial dates, the former president once again lashed out at the judge and the chief prosecutor leading the case against him. Lawyers for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office won’t be presenting new evidence when they wrap up their case on Tuesday, but it’s their one last shot to drive home their narrative and remind jurors what the case is all about. In his opening statement last month, assistant district attorney Matthew Colangelo argued that Mr Trump “orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election” and then “covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his business records, over and over and over again.” Mr Trump is accused of falsifying business records by labeling a series of payments in 2017 to his then-attorney Michael Cohen as a “retainer” and “legal expense”. But prosecutors argue that Mr Trump – who was the president at the time – was actually reimbursing his “fixer” for a hush money payment to Ms Daniels. Prosecutors must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Trump not only falsified business records, but did so with the intent to commit or cover up another crime. Prosecutors will likely walk jurors through that scheme one last time, and explain how that central fraud violated state and federal campaign finance law, tax law, and a state law against conspiracy to corrupt an election by “unlawful means.” Defense attorneys do not have to prove anything or convince jurors of Mr Trump’s innocence, but they will need to convince at least one juror that prosecutors have not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr Trump’s lawyers have argued that Cohen was merely paid for his work as the former president’s then-personal attorney, and that the hush money scheme – which itself was not illegal – was only to prevent embarrassing news of his affairs from getting to Mr Trump’s family, not in an attempt to hide them from voters. Before jurors are sent out of the courtroom to deliberate, Justice Juan Merchan will give them instructions – a framework for understanding the law surrounding the charges and what they can and cannot take into account as they determine his guilt or innocence. Prosecutors and defense attorneys debated the contours of those instructions and proposed their own during a two-hour hearing last week. Judge Merchan is expected to deliver those instructions on Wednesday morning before sending jurors off to deliberate in an undisclosed room in the courthouse. Jurors will be able to pass notes to the judge for things like clarifying legal language or reviewing testimony. But how long they will take to deliberate is anyone’s guess. The 12 jurors must unanimously agree on a guilty or not guilty verdict. If they can’t reach a consensus after several days of deliberations, the judge will likely ask them to keep trying. If they’re still deadlocked, he could declare a mistrial.",

        "content": "Beyoncé may have risen to the top of the Beyhive, but her peers didn't always look at her as a queen, according to her mom ... who says the pop star got bullied growing up. Tina Knowles sat down for a conversation with Vogue and, she shares memories about her three girls -- Bey, Solange and Kelly Rowland -- growing up ... including the heartbreaking bullying her elder daughter experienced. Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media. Listen to Mama Knowles tell it ... despite her onstage persona know, Tina insists Beyoncé was quite shy back in the day -- and, unfortunately, the timidness led to some run-ins with bullies. TK says her daughter handled business when it came time to do so though ... saying Beyoncé stood up to bullies when they went after one of her friends -- and, they didn't bother her again after that. As for Solange and Kelly ... Tina remembers them as an activist and peacemaker respectively -- and, the wistful smile on her face makes it clear she's got fond memories of those early days. Beyoncé's opened up about the bullying years ago, during a 2003 interview with Oprah where she says other kids laughed at how big her ears were ... she's cracking up during the clip though, so seems clear she'd come to terms with it. Despite coming out two months ago, Bey's \"Cowboy Carter\" is still top 10 on the Billboard 200 charts -- and, it broke records on Spotify after its release. And, her \"Renaissance\" tour last year literally boosted the American economy ... so, petty grudges aren't really on her radar these days. But, those bullies better hope their names don't come out ... 'cause the Beyhive's a lot less forgiving than their queen. 👀",

        "content": "DALLAS — The Timberwolves’ biggest flaw heading into the postseason was quite obvious to anyone who paid attention throughout the course of the regular season: They couldn’t close games. The Wolves were quite literally one of the NBA’s worst teams in clutch-time situations over the back half of the season. Clutch time is defined as the time in the final five minutes of a game in which the margin is within five points. In those situations post-Christmas, the Wolves were outscored by 26.5 points per 100 possessions. Their defense was bad in clutch time, and their offense was worse. Ball holding, indecision and a lack of player movement left the team’s late-game offense often stuck in the muck. Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

        "content": "DALLAS — The Timberwolves’ biggest flaw heading into the postseason was quite obvious to anyone who paid attention throughout the course of the regular season: They couldn’t close games. The Wolves were quite literally one of the NBA’s worst teams in clutch-time situations over the back half of the season. Clutch time is defined as the time in the final five minutes of a game in which the margin is within five points. In those situations post-Christmas, the Wolves were outscored by 26.5 points per 100 possessions. Their defense was bad in clutch time, and their offense was worse. Ball holding, indecision and a lack of player movement left the team’s late-game offense often stuck in the muck. Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.",

        "content": "A passenger had a confirmed case of measles on a connecting flight into Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) earlier this month, according to public health officials. According to a press release from the Los Angeles Department of Public Health, the passenger arrived at Gate 156 at the Tom Bradley International Terminal on May 19 around 3 p.m. PST aboard a Lufthansa flight. , an online flight tracking service, the flight was on the airline's Munich to Los Angeles route. Five hours later, the passenger , at Terminal 7, Gate 82. Individuals who were at the above LAX terminals from approximately 3:04 p.m. to 9 p.m. PST may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler, according to the press release. Exposed individuals should confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles, or if they have had measles in the past. There are no additional locations where possible exposures to this traveler may have occurred, according to reports. In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ), passengers assigned to specific seats that may been exposed on the Lufthansa flights on May 18-19 will be notified of exposure by local health officials. \"Measles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know you have it and can lead to severe disease,\" Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer, said in the press release. \"Measles is highly contagious for those who are not immune to it. Initially causing fever, cough, red, watery eyes, and followed by a rash, it can result in serious complications for young children and vulnerable adults.\" emailed the CDC and the L.A. Department of Public Health on Monday afternoon for additional comments. This article will be updated with any provided comments. Measles is a contagious respiratory infection that causes a rash and fever, and can lead to pneumonia and other complications. Symptoms include high fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. It spreads through the air via coughs or sneezes. can contract the infection up to two hours after an infected person was in the same room. Infected individuals can also spread measles four days before a rash ever appears, and four days after it does appear. According to the CDC, as of May 23, a total of 142 measles cases were reported by 21 states so far this year. There have been 10 outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) , and 68 percent of cases (97 of 142) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, four outbreaks were reported during 2023 and 48 percent of cases (28 of 58) were outbreak-associated. The worst-affected age group is those aged under 5 years old, representing 47 percent of cases. In comparison, the 5-19 years age group represents 22 percent of cases and the 20 years-plus age group represents 31 percent of cases. The CDC also noted that 82 percent of cases have been detected in the unvaccinated or those whose vaccination status was unknown. It also warned that the vaccination coverage among U.S. children in kindergarten has decreased from 95.2 percent during the 2019-2020 school year to 93.1 percent in 2022-2023, leaving around 250,000 children at risk. The disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, meaning that it is no longer constantly present and only appears when someone contracts the disease abroad and returns to the country. that while importations of measles cases into the U.S. are expected to continue, the risk from measles \"for the majority of the population would still remain low... because most people in the U.S. are vaccinated.\" It added: \"If measles re-establishes itself by having ongoing circulation, the U.S. will lose its elimination status. CDC defines measles elimination as the absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area. \"Even though we still have measles cases in the U.S., the majority of cases can be linked back to travelers who become infected with measles in other countries.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \"Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario's hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario's REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder's history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario's Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle' homes to Ontario's housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.\" – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059 Loading...

Party president Katie Morello made the announcement Saturday during the party's annual meeting in Cornwall, P.E.I. The party says the decision to wait two years was based on concerns that a leadership convention next year could come at the same time as a federal election, which must be called by October 2025. Former provincial Liberal leader Sharon Cameron resigned in April 2023 after she failed to win her seat in the provincial election earlier that month. Hal Perry, the Liberal member for Tignish-Palmer Road, was appointed interim leader at the time, which means the party will have had an interim leader for three years by the time a new leader is chosen. Morello says her party realizes the Green Party is also planning to choose a new leader in May 2026, but she says the two parties will make sure the events are held on different weekends. The governing Progressive Conservatives are not required to call a provincial election until October 2027. The Tories hold 21 of the legislature's 27 seats, while the Liberals and Greens have three each. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Vice President Kashim Shettima on Monday unveiled the State Action Plans on Durable Solution to Internal Displacement in the country. While unveiling the plan at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Mr Shettima called for a global partnership to address the problem of internal displacement in Nigeria. The action plan is a United Nations Secretary General’s Solution Agenda on Internal Displacement. It aims to help internally displaced persons find a durable solution to their displacement, prevent new displacement crises from emerging and ensure those facing displacement receive effective protection and assistance. The programme is being implemented in four northern states of Adamawa, Benue, Borno and Yobe. The Vice-President pledged the Federal Government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of displaced citizens. He outlined the strategy adopted by the President Bola Tinubu’s administration in tackling the country’s internal displacement challenge. “For a country that has endured the devastations of economic disadvantages across generations, we cannot afford further expansion in the displacement of our people. ” So, we remain committed to ensuring that each displaced individual returns to a safer environment and is given a lifeline to start afresh. “Let us harness the strength of our partnerships, both local and international, to bring about lasting change.” He welcomed the support of the United States and other global partners, stressing that the task ahead demands a united front that transcends political divides. ” We are here to craft solutions that will outlive us, that will offer future generations a place of hope, a home for all, and a land of opportunity where dreams can be pursued without worry. “The journey is not merely about addressing the symptoms of displacement but also about tackling the root causes,” he stated. Outlining the strategy of the Tinubu administration, Mr Shettima pledged investment in sustainable development, education, and economic opportunities as critical components of a comprehensive solution. “By doing so, we not only address the immediate needs of the displaced but also create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous future.” He called for collaborative efforts transcending borders to bring about lasting change, stating that “the task ahead is immense, but with determination, unity, and a clear vision, we can make a profound difference”. On her part, the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Amina Mohammed, commended the efforts of the state governments in drafting action plans for durable solutions to internal displacement. Speaking virtually through an online conferencing platform, Ms Mohammed, said attaining such solutions “is a priority for Nigeria and for the UN. She noted the global number of internally displaced persons has doubled in 10 years to nearly 76 million globally. “Over four million Nigerians remain in search of solutions to their forced displacement. The state action plans capture the first essential steps towards solutions.” Earlier, the UN Assistant Secretary-General and Special Advisor on Durable Solutions, Robert Piper, commended Nigeria’s commitment to the programme. “Today, despite the warnings and the real challenges, I have the honour to say, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that Nigeria is the first of all our 15 pilot countries to formally launch government plans placing over four million IDPs and Returnees on pathways to solutions.” Piper said the launch of the programme was evidence of the political commitment to addressing the plight of IDPs in the country. ” In many ways, the plans you launch today provide a model of how governments can take responsibility for ending displacement. ” Let me reiterate our commitment on behalf of the United Nations: We will keep supporting on the ground; we will help rally donors and we will chase missing partners. ” We will bring lessons from elsewhere; we will celebrate your successes; we may occasionally bring you unwelcome news sometimes, as friends must; but we will stand behind you. We fail or succeed together.” Also, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno, said the state government was fully committed to the implementation of the Action Plans on Durable Solutions. He noted that 15 per cent of the state’s annual budget would be dedicated to projects undertaken under the initiative. Mr Zulum recalled the efforts of the state government in the past few years in returning displaced persons to their communities. He assured stakeholders at the meeting that the government’s commitment to the cause of displaced persons remain unwavering. On his part, Governor Hyacinth Alia of Benue State, said the launch of the plans was a beacon of hope and catalyst for the transformation of lives and livelihoods in communities affected by conflict. He commended Vice-President Shettima’s inspirational leadership as well as the commitment of all the development partners involved in the project. He noted that the commitment of Shettima aligns with the vision of the State government to build a society where all residents can live in peace and harmony. In the same vein, Governor Mai Mala Bunu of Yobe, said the state government has executed projects across health, education, social welfare and security. Mr Bunu said that this was towards the bid to ensure that displaced persons in the state return to their communities safely. He reaffirmed the commitment of the state government in the operationalisation of the action plan by allocating five per cent of the state’s annual budget over the next three years. Mr Buni called on development partners involved in the programme not to relent in their efforts toward the success of the initiative. The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, commended the progress witnessed during his recent visit to the North-East and the government’s approach to encouraging more investments. “The progress I witnessed during my visit to the North-East recently deserves commendation. ” Nigeria is the first to prove that government-led intervention is possible. We are proud to be part of the process,” he stated. He also called for the mobilisation of new financing, saying “we need to mobilise additional bilateral and multilateral financing to support these plans. “We should also think carefully about how to mobilize Nigeria’s vibrant private sector, not necessarily as a donor but as the engine for economic growth and job creation.

        "content": "On the May 10, 2017 edition of WWE NXT, Cezar Bononi wrestled Aleister Black, now known as Malakai Black in AEW, with Black going over. After initial hype as the next big NXT star, he was let go in 2020. While speaking on an episode of the Developmentally Speaking podcast, the match saved his career. Here are the highlights (per Fightful) : On the bout: “Yeah, the first match that I had on TV, for sure, with Aleister Black, Malakai. There were so many people saying to me that was not going to make it to TV ever then I had that opportunity. It was a really good opportunity. To be honest, I was going to be fired the next day but I did such a good job in that match that saved my my job.” On whether he knew he would get fired: “Cuts. Just cuts. They had to cut and I understand the business, it’s all good. They just had to cut to get new people and whoever is not getting good results, they cut. That’s how business works. I never thought there was something personal or whatever. Actually, I was not delivering whatever was necessary as well. I totally understand on the business side of that. The good thing is that I got at least one chance to do something, and I did it good.”",

        "content": "The City of Lorain’s annual Memorial Day Parade brought hundreds of people to the downtown district despite windy weather topped with cloudy skies. The parade kicked off at 11 a.m. sharp on Eighth Street and proceeded down Broadway Avenue until reaching Black River Landing, according to Lorain Mayor Jack Bradley. Bradley, who had a number of vehicles decorated with his name, walked in the parade alongside Safety Service Director Rey Carrion and others. Lorain Police cruisers led the parade under the blue and white Broadway sign with a number of its vehicles such as “The Beast,” its SWAT vehicle, and others. Multiple youth of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps followed the leading police cruisers in their uniforms. Amy Pruitt, a mother of four Lorain High School students, grabbed a spot on the side of Broadway Avenue at 9:30 a.m. eagerly awaiting the parade. “This is one of the first events that all four of my kids are in,” Pruitt said. “I’m proud, excited and intrigued spotting them in the crowd. I’m going to root for them when I see them.” While Pruitt was excited, it was also a bittersweet day for her as the parade was also the last time her four children would be in the parade as they will be graduating. Three of Pruitt’s children were marching with the Lorain High School band while the fourth participated as part of his duties of the Junior ROTC, she said. Shannon Argenti, also of Lorain, was sitting along Broadway Avenue with her 5-year-old stepson Hunter Argenti, who was looking forward to catching and gathering the candy which was thrown out to the crowd by several people, including the Lorain Fire Department. The Argentis were in attendance to watch 15-year-old Malicai Argenti, a member of the Junior ROTC, who was marching with the group, said Argenti. “I’m looking forward to seeing him in the parade,” she said, adding that she was excited to see the parade and share in the overall experience. Several residents in street vehicles were also a part of the parade in addition to the Lorain High School and Clearview High School bands and cheerleaders. Also represented at the parade were the Veteran’s Administration Medical Transportation and Valor Home.",

        "content": "Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy was shocked to discover that newspaper chain/media company USA Today quietly eliminated his op-ed in which he criticized transgender athletes. Not only did the Gannett-owned paper chain delete op-ed, they didn’t even tell him they were deleting the article that had already been published by several of the chain’s participating papers days before. The article, published in eight of the Gannett papers, was entitled, “Is transgender inclusion more important than women’s sports?” and excerpts of his piece are still on the Louisianan’s senate website. But while the article is still featured on his senate website, the full article was removed from all the papers. Now, when you click to the link where the article used to appear, readers see a that reads, “Content removed: did not meet editorial standards,” and continues saying, “This content has been removed because it did not meet our editorial standards.” The senator has since told that his article was removed because he didn’t bend his knee to the woke terminology that the paper wanted him to use when speaking about radical transgenderism. slammed the USA Today, telling Fox News, that the “USA TODAY Network apparently does not like the way I express myself.” “They think they are the speech police. Drunk on certainty and virtue, they think they are our moral teacher. This attitude is why so many Americans have lost confidence in the media. The media is not going to win that trust back until they return to neutrality instead of advocacy,” Kennedy claimed. According to his website, he made a series of claims in his article denouncing , each backed up with a link to the source he used to reach his conclusions. “Some activists claim that transgender athletes are different from typical men because they take cross-sex hormones. After two years of cross-sex hormone treatments, however, biological male athletes run 12% faster and pound out 10% more push-ups than women,” Kennedy wrote. also said, “Allowing biological boys to compete as girls will harm women’s sports. Still, many activists believe their feelings and the feelings of transgender athletes are more important.” “Men and women don’t compete for the same reasons. Yet transgender activists want athletic institutions to ignore these obvious physical differences so transgender athletes can feel included, even if it hurts biological girls in the process,” the sen. also said. After the paper published the op-ed early in May, Kennedy said he noticed by May 14 that the links he supplied to the articles on his senate website no longer worked. Kennedy told Fox News that he reached out to one of the affiliated papers that originally published the article and had an email exchange with Misty Castile, the executive editor for the Shreveport Times. At first, Castile claimed that they deleted Kennedy’s article because of a lack of “citations” to support his claims. But in a follow-up email, she backtracked on that claim after Kennedy pointed out that there were half a dozen links to citations to support his claims. In other emails, Castile accused Kennedy of using “loaded language” because he wrote “biological male” and “biological female.” Castile further demanded that he rewrite the article to use the left’s woke terminology and then she would “consider” republishing the article. Kennedy blasted the paper chain, saying, “Most people don’t support allowing biological men to participate in women’s sports because they think that will bastardize sports, skew the results, and hurt women. Other people disagree. Gannett should simply report the two sides and not try to silence the position it disagrees with.” We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

A public grand opening celebration is scheduled for June 1 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 4610 Colley Ave., Norfolk. In conjunction with the grand opening, shops up and down Colley Avenue will join forces with the Elizabeth River Project to launch an “EcoDistrict,” encouraging businesses and residents to adopt eco-friendly practices in solidarity with the new Ryan Resilience Lab in their midst. The Resilience Lab, intentionally constructed inside a flood zone along one of Norfolk’s busiest commercial corridors and flanked by multiple residential neighborhoods, showcases what the future of sustainable coastal living might look like. Inside and out, visitors will find ways to live sustainably and prepare for rising tides, project coordinators said in a news release.

        "content": "National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir announced on Monday that he will recommend the termination of Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai, months after extending the police chief’s tenure, during a political dispute. In a statement, Ben Gvir said the recommendation came in light of the commissioner’s performance during Hamas’s October 7 massacre in southern Israel. A letter to Shabtai quoted in the statement pointed to “mounting allegations” of general disfunction that “have a negative impact on the Israel Police in general, and in this wartime period in particular.” Examples of Ben Gvir’s complaints against the police commissioner included failure to attend an assessment on plans to close the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai on Mount Meron for Lag B’Omer this week, given concerns of a rocket attack by Hezbollah. Clashes broke out over the weekend between police and ultra-Orthodox pilgrims to Meron, when hundreds arrived at the tomb in violation of orders that deemed the site off-limits. “According to senior police officers, you were completely ‘out of touch,'” Ben Gvir charged in the letter, while adding an accusation that Shabtai only promotes officers close to him. He also wrote that Shabtai has failed to hold “in-depth meetings and status updates” on crime in the Arab community, despite being instructed to do so and raised complaints about failure to implement orders “regarding vehicle thefts, traffic accidents, recruitment, implementation of budgets, procurement and general management of the police.” Ben Gvir noted that a state commission of inquiry in March had named Shabtai as one of a number of officials personally responsible for the 2021 Meron disaster and said that were it not for the ongoing war in Gaza it would have recommended his termination. The statement recalled that the commission had instead recommended that the government determine the appropriate date for his term to end. The national security minister has already selected Deputy Commissioner Avshalom Peled as the next police commissioner, as Shabtai’s tenure was already due to end on July 17. Responding to Ben Gvir’s announcement, sources close to the police commissioner were quoted by Hebrew media as saying that the letter was delivered in an unorthodox manner, which they said was “a resounding testimony to the indecorous and thuggish behavior of a minister who does not accept the law.” The sources charged that Ben Gvir has been “violently trying to take over the police and turn it into a private militia,” according to the Ynet news site and the Israel Hayom newspaper. Ben Gvir and Shabtai have had an up-and-down relationship. The minister threatened last year not to extend the police commissioner’s term by the customary year, triggering a spat with National Unity chair Benny Gantz that was ultimately negotiated by the Likud party. Shabtai had been due to end his tenure in January, and had previously said he would not seek an extension, but changed his decision after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught and the subsequent war in Gaza. Ben Gvir’s Monday statement said that Shabtai had been summoned to a hearing on the matter next Wednesday, after which he will make his recommendation to the government.",

        "content": "Two women accused Washington Commanders kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them on a Jacksonville Jaguars team flight to London last year. According to ESPN's Michael DiRocco , the two flight attendants filed a lawsuit Friday seeking over $1 million in damages. They claimed McManus grinded up against them and tried to kiss one of them. McManus, who was playing for Jacksonville at the time, signed with Washington this offseason. Per The Washington Post's Nicki Jhabvala , the Commanders released a statement regarding the accusations against their new kicker. \"Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter,\" a Commanders spokesperson said. \"We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon's representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\" The Jaguars declined to comment to DiRocco and have not addressed the allegations. The alleged victims named them in the lawsuit for failing to create a safe working environment for the flight crew. DiRocco wrote that McManus or his attorney will likely release a statement later on Monday. The lawsuit claimed that the Oct. 8 flight to London \"quickly turned into a party,\" with McManus and other players disregarding air travel safety and the flight staff's personal space. McManus allegedly offered $100 bills to flight attendants to persuade them to drink with and dance inappropriately for him. One of the women who filed the lawsuit claimed McManus \"smirked and walked away\" after she confronted him. The complaint said the two women were removed from Jaguars flights and \"experienced severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation.\"",

        "content": "CHARLOTTETOWN - The Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island has decided to wait until May 2026 to select a new leader. Party president Katie Morello made the announcement Saturday during the party’s annual meeting in Cornwall, P.E.I. The party says the decision to wait two years was based on concerns that a leadership convention next year could come at the same time as a federal election, which must be called by October 2025. Former provincial Liberal leader Sharon Cameron resigned in April 2023 after she failed to win her seat in the provincial election earlier that month. Hal Perry, the Liberal member for Tignish-Palmer Road, was appointed interim leader at the time, which means the party will have had an interim leader for three years by the time a new leader is chosen. Morello says her party realizes the Green Party is also planning to choose a new leader in May 2026, but she says the two parties will make sure the events are held on different weekends. The governing Progressive Conservatives are not required to call a provincial election until October 2027. The Tories hold 21 of the legislature’s 27 seats, while the Liberals and Greens have three each. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "TRADER JOE'S loyalists are lining up for the relaunch of six popular summertime treats. 'Tis the season for lime-flavored treats , sweet cakes, and special ice creams to keep you cool. Summer is upon us and exclusive desserts are returning to Trader Joe's in celebration. Fans of sour, sweet, creamy, and crunchy are gearing up for the season with these six sweet treats, reported Eat This, Not That . Trader Joe's famous Key Lime Pie is officially back in freezers for $5.99. The pie features a creamy key lime curd with a buttery graham cracker crust. Trader Joe's Treasure Hunt , an Instagram account dedicated to sharing the latest items, reviews, and recipes out of the grocery chain, recommends customers pair the pie with a whopping serving of whipped cream. \"They had my ALL TIME FAVORITE ITEM!!! It’s seasonal,\" posted one user on X , the website formerly known as Twitter. Those looking to keep it in the key lime family will be thrilled to find the store is also selling its Key Lime Tea Cookies again. The \"sweet-tart flavor and crumbly texture,\" of the powder sugar-coated shortbread cookies make them a sweet addition to vanilla or mint chip ice cream. A box goes for $5.99. Trader Joe's wants fans to know there's something out there to satisfy everyone's sweet tooth — even those who are gluten-free. The store's back with its Gluten Free Strawberry Muffins which come in a pack of four for $5.99. Made with a blend of white and brown rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca starch, the muffins are allergen-safe, but those who eat gluten would never know, according to Eat This, Not That. Those down with dairy can pick up the easy Tres Leches Cake that comes frozen and only requires a few hours at room temperature or a night in the fridge before it's ready to serve. The airy sponge cake is soaked in heavy cream, evaporated milk, and sweetened condensed milk and topped with whipped cream. Those lacking a sweet tooth will be pleased to find Trader Joe's has limited seasonal items for them too. Popcorn in a Pickle is back for fans of that tart taste. Popped large mushroom kernels take on a tart dill pickle seasoning for $2.29/bag. Lemon Basil Pesto – a cheesy, lemony, nutty sauce that shines over pasta is back and only $3.49/jar. The Brazil Nut Body Wash and Body Butter are back for fans looking for a dupe of Sol de Janeiro's Bum Bum Cream, reported Eat This, Not That. Each. item in the line costs $5.99. The Sweet Corn, Burrata & Basil Ravioli have returned and can be paired with olive oil, balsamic glaze, and even the Lemon Basil Pesto. One package costs $3.99. It's $7.99 and can feed four. TJ\"s is also welcoming two new ice creams back to its freezer, including Fudgy Cookie Dough Ice Cream — a vanilla base mixed with chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate chips, and a sea salt fudge swirl. It's $3.79 a pint and fans are scooping it up quickly. And lastly, Ube Ice Cream ($3.79) is making its return for the third season in a row. The creamy, sweet, nutty flavor of ube hails from purple yams in the Philippines and fans can't get enough of it. Capri Sun announced a new twist to its juice packets sold at Costco. Plus, a consumer analyst offered up her eight favorite items under $5 from Trader Joe's.",

        "content": "TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- “Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario’s hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario’s REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder’s history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario’s Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle’ homes to Ontario’s housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.” – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059",
