        "content": "A BUDGET-FRIENDLY buy has shoppers rushing to a popular discount website to snag a life-changing product. The affordable item from Amazon made a huge difference for curvy queens with thigh thighs. Shoppers can't get enough of a cheap Amazon product that takes care of a pesky skin issue. The Body Glide for Her Anti-Chafe Balm , $9, is flying off the metaphorical shelves for its effectiveness. It is great for dry, sensitive skin or sensitive areas. The cheap buy was celebrated online by many for being an easy solution for chafing. Chafing is a skin irritation that occurs when skin rubs against skin, clothing, or other material. For many women, it occurs around their inner thighs. According to the product instructions, apply it before you put on clothes. The item can go on the inner thighs, around a sports bra, or wherever skin is sensitive to rubbing. Buyers gushed about the balm in their reviews, and it especially worked well for curvy women with thick thighs. Amazon shopper Krishna said, \"this stuff is amazing.\" She was so impressed by the product that she gave it a five-star rating. \"I have put on some weight so I have been hitting the exercise hard. I walk at least 10 thousand steps a day. I was getting chafed and irritated,\" she admitted \"This stuff took care of all of that. I’ve had no issues since using it. It has no smell, glides on smooth, and makes exercise much more comfortable.\" She was also surprised at how small this was but still expects it to last a while. Another reviewer named Ray called it a \"thigh-saving marvel\" and penned a \"love letter\" about the item. \"Calling all my fellow thick thigh warriors! Gather 'round, because I have a tale of triumph and a product that has forever changed the chafing game,\" she wrote. Ray said it was \"the ultimate secret weapon against the dreaded thigh rub.\" \"Picture this: a curvy queen, strutting through life with all the confidence in the world, only to be thwarted by the relentless chafing torment between her magnificent thighs,\" she added. \"But fear not, my fellow thigh-savers, for Body Glide is here to rescue us from that fiery hell!\" The Curly Jenny dubbed it \"the best thing invented\" for thick girls and also said it was five out of five stars. \"This product is amazing! I wore it during carnival, if I have to walk a lot, or while traveling and it works like a charm,\" she said. \"I used to put deodorant but now this Body Glide slides right and doesn't allow your legs to rub. This is great for the THIC girls with thick thighs saving life.\" According to experts from the Cleveland Clinic , chafing is a skin condition that occurs when you have repeated skin-on-skin contact. It can also occur when your skin rubs against clothing or another material. There are several common causes for the condition. They include intense exercise, ill-fitting clothes, excess skin, and hot weather.",

        "content": "A STUNNING motor that Jeremy Clarkson once described as the \"best-looking car money can buy\" could be yours for just £6,000 second-hand. Clarkson has long been a fan of the Alfa Romeo brand, and even once said: “You cannot be a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa.\" That's particularly true about the Alfa Romeo Brera, which he gushed over on a 2006 episode of Top Gear . The Italian set of wheels, which ran from 2005 to 2010, was the brain-child of much-heralded car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro - who also worked on other beautiful motors such as the Maserati Merak, Lotus Esprit, and even the iconic DMC Delorean. The Brera was made available in two petrol modes, a 2.2-litre and a 3.2-litre V6 - capable of 256 bhp. A diesel version was made, too. But it's the motor's stunning looks that's the real selling point, along with its wonderful interior styling and even its decent luggage space. Loosely considered a crossover between a hatchback and a coupe, the Brera's long bonnet and short, low back gave it an unusual and sporty image, coupled with the sleek triangular grille coupled with three round headlamps on each side. On the Top Gear episode, Clarkson said: “We think it may very well be the best-looking car that money can buy.\" And Richard Hammond added: \"It's just gorgeous from every angle.” The motoring guru even scoffed when a member of the audience suggested the Aston Martin Vanquish was better looking. Even its name exudes class and style, with Brera being a district of Milan where art, history , and fashion meet. Nowadays, the Brera can be picked up for a reasonable price, with a 3.2-litre JTS V6 example from 2009 available for less than £6,000 . If you're looking for something much newer, then Sun Motors' main man Rob Gill recently took the eye-catching Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio for a test drive - which he described as \"beyond brilliant\" with a price tag that's \"an absolute bargain.\" Alfa Romeo also made the news in bizarre fashion last month when they were forced to change the name of their newewst EV after it broke an obscure piece of legislation.",

CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link. CONTINUE READING Show less A “self--inflicted wound” could be to blame if Donald Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial, a former federal prosecutor told the Washington Post . Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post. ALSO READ: NFL drafts Capitol Hill staffers for lobbying retreat \"The defense finally got some momentum, and it all got dialed back because Costello was playing to Trump instead of playing it straight. He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" Trump is facing 34 charges of business fraud involving allegations that he paid adult movie star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about a sexual relationship the two had.

        "content": "Researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) are investigating the effects ellagic acid, an antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, could have on halting and potentially reversing the damage caused by fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the physiological manifestation of obesity in the liver. The prevalence of NAFLD has increased from 25.24% in 2015 to 29.38% in 2021, and this condition now accounts for 45.8% of all cases of chronic-liver-disease-related deaths worldwide. There currently exists no treatment for the long-term management of NAFLD; however, dietary interventions have been investigated for the treatment of this disease, including several polyphenolic compounds such as ellagic acid. ECU researcher Dr. Lois Balmer and Ph.D. student Mrs. Tharani Senavirathna noted that ellagic acid, which is found in a variety of food such as raspberries , pomegranate , blackberries, and pecan nuts, is widely recognized for its antioxidant properties, but also exhibits anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and anticancer properties. The paper is published in the journal Antioxidants . \"Ellagic acid stands out as a remarkable polyphenolic compound, possessing a wide range of pharmacological properties that hold promise in treating various chronic diseases, including NAFLD. \"Due to its multifaceted biological effects, edible plants containing ellagic acid, and its derivatives are recognized as valuable functional foods for enhancing human health. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that ellagic acid, when combined with other antioxidant nutraceuticals, exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect, making it a potential candidate for combination therapy .\" Mrs. Senavirathna was involved in a previously undertaken pilot study investigating the effects of several polyphenolic compounds on NAFLD, with ellagic acid showing the most promise in reducing inflammation. A larger study is now under way which will also investigate at which point of the illness treatment would be ineffective to reverse damage to the liver.

        "content": "This positive development was revealed in the MAN CEO’s Confidence Index Report (MCCI) for Q1’24, released recently. The MCCI serves as an index to gauge changes in the quarterly outlook of CEOs of manufacturing firms concerning government policies and macroeconomic indicators. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, Director General of MAN, commented on the report, stating, “The moderate improvement in the Aggregate Index Score (AIS), from 51.8 points to 53.5 points, signifies a positive shift in the manufacturing sector’s sentiment. This suggests a trajectory towards restoration and recovery, potentially reaching levels observed in Q3 2022, with optimism for further improvement in the coming quarter.” He attributed this improvement to the resilience of manufacturers, recent gains made by the Naira, anticipated reduction in diesel prices, and expectations regarding the seamless disbursement of presidential intervention funds for the sector. However, Ajayi-Kadir cautioned that despite these positive indicators, emerging policies may pose challenges to this optimism. Highlighting the significance of the manufacturing sector in driving economic growth and fostering prosperity, Ajayi-Kadir emphasized the need for the government to prioritize the sector by providing necessary policy support and incentives.

        "content": "An artificial pancreas developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge has been granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by individuals with type 1 diabetes aged 2 and older, including during pregnancy. This means that even more people living with the disease will be able to use this life-changing app. For the first time, the FDA authorized the use of the artificial pancreas system in pregnancy. CamAPS FX, produced by Cambridge spinout company CamDiab, is an Android app that can be used to help manage glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes, including during pregnancy. The app allows a compatible insulin pump and a compatible continuous glucose monitor to 'talk to each other,\" creating an artificial pancreas. The CamAPS FX closed loop algorithm was given FDA authorization on Thursday 23 May. It had already been CE-marked for use in the UK and the EU. CamAPS FX creator Roman Hovorka is Professor of Metabolic Technology at the Institute of Metabolic Science and Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, where the technology was developed. He said, \"We set out to help people with type 1 diabetes and their families live better lives and we're delighted that the FDA has reviewed the safety and effectiveness of CamAPS FX and has given the technology its approval.\" \"It has been extensively tested and we're proud that it is considered by many to be the best algorithm out there.\" CamAPS FX is already used by more than 27,000 people in 15 countries across Europe and Australia. Artificial pancreas systems such as CamAPS FX have been granted approval for wide use by the NHS in November 2023 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).",

Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago. Moscow has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukrainian children , especially through its illegal deportation of children into Russia. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes against kids. In Kharkiv, another frontline city and the focus of Russia's new offensive , The Sun watched as a Ukrainian soldier wedded his sweetheart before heading to fight. The number of couples tying the knot in the bomb-blitzed region rose by 11 per cent to 10,977 as troops fear they might not make it back. It comes as Ukraine carried out its deepest ever drone strike 1,120 miles inside Russia. The attack targeted radar systems and even buzzed close to Putin's £1billion Black Sea fortress palace as it hit infrastructure nearby.",

Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "content": "Scarcely has the dust of the Lok Sabha election settled than the ruling Ajit Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is girding up for the Maharashtra Assembly polls to be held later this year. The tone and tenor of the crucial meeting of the State executive of Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction in Mumbai on Monday saw Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, along with other senior leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal and Sunil Tatkare already making noises about getting a larger share of seats from its partners in the Mahayuti government — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena — in the Assembly election likely to be held in October this year. “Elections are a test for party workers. No one should be over-the-top with joy following an election victory, nor should one be disheartened by defeat,” said Mr. Pawar while addressing his party workers at the meet. Minister Chhagan Bhujbal made it clear that the NCP would have to be given a larger share of seats in the Assembly election than it had received in the general election this year. 80-90 constituencies: Bhujbal “Only if we are given 80-90 seats [of the total 288 Assembly seats in Maharashtra] can we hope to win 50 or 60 of them. Whatever may have happened this time [Lok Sabha seat-sharing process], but in the coming election, the NCP should get its rightful share of seats. When we entered [the Mahayuti coalition], we were told we would be given our fair share of seats,” Mr. Bhujbal said. Mr. Pawar also staked claim to the Satara Rajya Sabha seat during the course of his address. Mr. Pawar, who split the NCP founded by his uncle Sharad Pawar in July last year, had been given only four Lok Sabha seats — Baramati, Shirur, Raigad, Dharashiv — of the total 48 in the Mahayuti’s seat-sharing formula. The BJP, being the largest party in the State in terms of number of MPs, had fielded candidates on 29 Lok Sabha seats. However, Mr. Shinde had driven a hard bargain with his saffron ally, managing to secure 15 Lok Sabha seats in the Shiv Sena’s kitty. This had upset Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction, which had been importuning the BJP high command for at least eight Lok Sabha seats. ‘BJP will contest most seats’ Meanwhile, responding to Mr. Bhujbal’s remarks, BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP would get the maximum seats to contest the Assembly election as it was numerically the biggest party. At the same time, Mr. Fadnavis assured that the BJP’s Mahayuti allies would be accorded due respect in the seat-sharing process. “Leaders of all the three parties of the Mahayuti alliance will sit together to decide a proper seat-sharing formula for the Assembly election. Obviously, BJP will get the maximum number of seats as it is the biggest party. However, our allies will be shown due respect in the process,” he said. In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election, the BJP had won 105 seats, while its then ally — the undivided Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray had won 56 seats. The undivided Nationalist Congress Party, which was part of the opposition Congress-led UPA, had won 41 seats.

        "content": "Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne 'has secretly welcomed a son' with wife Celina Bassili as couple make their first public appearance with the child in London - three years after exchanging vows By Jason Chester for MailOnline Published: 21:38 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:47 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne confirmed he has secretly fathered a son with wife Celina Bassili during an appearance in London over the weekend. The actor, who is set to reprise his best known role in a forthcoming Christmas special, is said to have welcomed the child with set designer Bassili shortly after their wedding in September 2021. In pictures obtained by The Sun , Horne, 45, is seen pushing an empty buggy while his wife cradles the infant as they make the most of the bank holiday weekend weather. Close friends, among them Gavin & Stacey co-stars James Corden and Joanna Page, are understood to be aware of the birth - which was not made public by the couple at the time. A source told The Sun: 'Mathew is a brilliant dad and he and Celina love being parents. Gavin & Stacey star Mathew Horne confirmed he has secretly fathered a son with wife Celina Bassili during an appearance in London over the weekend (pictured here on May 7) The actor is said to have welcomed the child with set designer Bassili shortly after their wedding in September 2021 (pictured) Read More Gavin And Stacey IS coming back! Fans rejoice over 'best news ever' as James Corden and Ruth Jones make dramatic U-turn to write LAST EVER episode set to air on Christmas Day - but there's one thing EVERYONE is dying to know 'Celina’s brother has a son who is a similar age and they loved spending time together. 'Mathew also kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin & Stacey. 'All his Gavin & Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page. 'They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.' Horne travelled to Bassili's native Norway for their wedding ceremony in 2021, with the couple tying the knot in the 15-acre grounds of a 1930s mansion. The actor was first seen kissing the set designer during a night out in Wales two years earlier, while they were busy filming the last Gavin & Stacey Christmas special. Bassili, who graduated from University Of Arts London with a first class degree in set design, lists the Gavin & Stacey special on her online CV. With the kiss, he appeared to confirm his relationship was over with Casualty actress Evelyn Hoskins, who he proposed to in October. A spokesperson later told MailOnline: 'Mathew and Evelyn separated amicably in October 2018.' Mathew was first seen kissing set designer Celina in a Burger King in 2019, which confirmed the end of his nine-month engagement to actress Evelyn Hoskins (pictured) James Corden and Ruth Jones have written the last ever episode of Gavin And Stacey, set to air on Christmas Day The BBC is reportedly set to treat Gavin & Stacey fans with a double helping of the show this Christmas In addition to the grand finale, BBC bosses have commissioned a special behind-the-scenes documentary which will look at the programme's 17-year history The BBC is reportedly set to treat Gavin & Stacey fans with a double helping of the show this Christmas. Earlier this month, the sitcom's stars Corden, 45, and Ruth Jones, 57, announced that it was returning for one last episode. And in addition to the grand finale, BBC bosses have commissioned a special behind-the-scenes documentary which will look at the programme's 17-year history. Cameras have been following the cast, including titular stars Horne and Page as they film scenes for the last ever instalment. A TV insider told The Sun: 'The Beeb view this as a momentous occasion and wanted to give Gavin & Stacey a suitably auspicious send-off. 'The fact that the documentary will be made by Fulwell 73, which is co-owned by James and is a co-producer of the sitcom, means they’ll enjoy full access on set and get all the biggest chats. 'It is likely to be made in tandem with the show itself, filming the creative process of delivering the finale from the first to the last day.'

        "description": "Indigenous culture took centre stage in Super Netball First Nations Round, but what are the clubs doing in National Reconciliation Week to form an authentic connection with community? Meanwhile, the Fever have finally been dethroned after a six-week winning streak.",
        "content": "Wow, that went fast! Week seven marked the midway point of the Super Netball season and the first half of First Nations Round. The action began on Kabi Kabi Country, where the Sunshine Coast Lightning made it two wins in a row to claim Queensland Derby bragging rights against the Firebirds, 76-65. A grand final re-match between the Adelaide Thunderbirds and NSW Swifts on Kaurna Country saw the visiting team succumb to the lowest-ever Super Netball score in history, 58-33. Yes, you read that right. The Melbourne Mavericks' drought at home continued as they lost 66-59 to the Giants in Naarm. Before the Melbourne Vixens became the first team this season to beat the West Coast Fever in stunning fashion in Boorloo, 76-65. If you missed it, don't worry — we'll get you up to speed with our Super Netball Round-Up. First Nations Round, part one One of the key differences in fixtures this season has been the split of First Nations Round. Previously, the league held its celebration of Indigenous culture across back-to-back rounds during National Reconciliation Week (May 27- June 3) to allow each club a chance to host. But this year, Super Netball has a larger gap between the two rounds so that the first was held right before National Reconciliation Week in round seven and the second aligns with the start of NAIDOC Week (July 7 – July 14) in round 13. The shift on the Super Netball calendar was recommended by First Nations engagement lead and Kamilaroi woman Ali Tucker-Munro, who was appointed in her role in July 2023. The sport has made important steps in this space since its – such as its recent introduction of an named the Black Swans. Netball takes a significant step in its commitment to increase the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander athletes, introducing an inaugural First Nations team to compete against World Cup talent at the Pacific Aus Sport Netball Series. \"The reason for separating the rounds and playing in the lead-up to National Reconciliation Week was because it sets the tone,\" Tucker-Munro said. \"The week is all about reflection and for non-Indigenous Australians to recognise what they need to do to be part of the reconciliation journey. \"The intent was to give all of netball's member organisations and Super Netball teams the opportunity to demonstrate what they're doing in partnership with our communities, because that's the missing piece. \"Instead of sitting there and either thinking or saying, 'Our sport needs to do better,' people need to recognise that they have to be part of that change as much as anyone else. \"So, what does reconciliation mean to you as a non-Indigenous Australian and what are you doing in the other 50 weeks of the year to make a change at your team, club or association level? \"That's what's important to our community, because we as First Nations people can sense if something is inauthentic from a mile away.\" Most grassroots associations will be hosting activities this upcoming Saturday and Sunday during the actual week, and Tucker-Munro reiterates it was Super Netball's job to amplify its \"Join in the Journey\" message ahead of time to set an example for the entire ecosystem. The fact remains that just two of Super Netball's 80 full-time athletes are Indigenous – a ratio much lower than what we see in the footballing codes. So, the purpose of the round should be to build a genuine relationship with the Indigenous community, celebrate their contribution to the sport and find ways to retain First Nations talent in netball. ABC Sport has been in touch with each of the Super Netball clubs to find out more about the kinds of activities each team got up to this week. The dresses this year were stunning of course, but it can be easy to get caught up in what's happening at that superficial level and harder to find out about the action behind the scenes. It would be great to see clubs promote their work in this space more prominently on social media. The host broadcaster Fox Netball can also play a role in highlighting this. Last year's Indigenous round turned into a PR disaster for Super Netball, but rising star Gabby Coffey hopes a renewed focus this year will help draw Indigenous athletes to the sport. For instance, Super Netball stars Leesa Mi Mi (Wakka Wakka) and Donnell Wallam (Noongar) were talked about on the coverage, but Vixens training partner Gabby Coffey (Wiradjuri) less so, even after she was elevated to the team's game-day squad through injury. To focus on the positives, two great examples of connection that caught our eye included Lightning's and Netball Queensland taking the next step in their Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Lightning's video was filmed on Kabi Kabi Country with elders from local First Nations Group Yir'un-Yalangi and has been played at every one of the club's home games this season. Meanwhile, Netball Queensland moved on to the second part of its RAP process \"Innovate\" last week and for a second straight year, the Firebirds First Nations dresses will be auctioned off to raise money for their Diamond Spirit program. Fever's winning streak finally broken It may have taken seven rounds to find a side that could dismantle Fever's attacking dominance, but from an entertainment perspective, it was worth the wait. The Vixens, sitting second in the league, had their five-game unbeaten streak snapped last week in round six against the Lightning. Yet they bounced back from that loss to put on their best performance so far in 2024 – despite missing a couple of players. Defender Kate Eddy was out for a second straight week with a leg injury, while midcourter Zara Walters was missing for a fourth round in a row as she continues to rehab a lower back issue. These omissions didn't stop the Vixens from running rampant at the back of the court and head coach Simone McKinnis didn't even make a single change to her starting seven. Experienced defenders Emily Mannix and Jo Weston got their usual starts, this time at goal defence and wing defence, allowing Rudi Ellis to occupy the goal keeper bib. Ellis played two seasons at the Fever before heading back to Vixens this year and her insights into the workings of her former club truly came in handy. Playing against the tallest shooter in the competition, Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard, Ellis used her footwork and timing to overcome the 8-centimetre difference in the match-up. There's a reason Fowler-Nembhard is a five-time Super Netball MVP and her team's ball speed and incredible work rate have made it difficult to stop the feed heading into her in their shooting circle. Enter Mannix, Weston and Ellis at the peak of their powers and suddenly Fever were the most unsteady we've seen them this season, panicking and trying to force the ball long. That pressure crept into Fowler-Nembhard's game too, as she had her first miss midway through the first quarter and went on to finish the game with 43/47 at 92 per cent accuracy. It seems crazy to suggest a player had an off game while shooting in the 90 percentile, and that's a compliment to Fowler-Nembhard's standards – because she is just so tough to face. But when we see her typically tallying 60-plus goals each week and only ever missing one or two goals in a match, it shows how much of a thorn Ellis was in her side for round seven. So huge kudos to Ellis (four gains, one rebound, one deflection, three intercepts) is in order, as well to her teammates Mannix, Weston and Kate Moloney at centre for their work out front. It's no surprise that the team is excelling under the guidance of Vixens' specialist defence coach and two-time world champion Sharni Norder (née Layton), who was rightly tight-lipped and unwilling to share much about their game plan. Crowds are on the up We've already alluded to this this season, but it has been great to see a boom in crowd numbers. Fans turn up in droves to break Super Netball's opening round attendance records. At the halfway point, there has been a 34 per cent increase in the average attendance per round (now up to 21,613) in comparison with crowd numbers at this point last year. This is partly due to the move for Super Netball teams to play at larger venues – such as the Thunderbirds for their home games, thanks to a leg-up offered by their state government to underwrite the costs. In round seven, 8,447 people turned up to watch their side take on the Swifts, marking the biggest turnout they've had so far this season. Other state governments should take notice. For instance, the Lightning had a sell-out crowd on Saturday for the Queensland Derby, but the USC stadium capacity only holds 3,000 people. Imagine how many fans would have come through the gates for the Battle of the Bruce Highway if they had played at a larger venue. However, the club that has truly been leading the way ever since the Super Netball era began is the Fever. On Sunday, 11,119 fans turned up to Perth Arena to watch a top-of-the-ladder contest against the Vixens. Their side may have lost the game, but it was a huge win for the club off the court, as that was Fever's biggest crowd ever for a non-finals match. In fact, they've registered four of their top five regular season crowds over the past two years. At a time when the sport is trying to realise its true commercial potential, whatever Fever is getting up to on the west coast should be studied because it is seriously impressive. 11,119 Fever v Vixens Round 7 2024 11,013 Fever v Giants Round 13 2023 10,764 Fever v Lightning Round 12 2023 8,702 Fever v Lightning Round 2 2024 8,306 Fever v Giants Round 6 2018 Is Ash Ervin our next gen Diamonds GK? Australia has a long history of producing impressive goal keepers. Liz Ellis, Laura Geitz and the incumbent Courtney Bruce are just some of the names on the long list of Diamonds defenders who are considered legends of the world game. Watching 21-year-old Ash Ervin play for the Sunshine Coast Lightning this year has therefore got a lot of fans excited about the future of our national team. Defenders typically bloom in the later stages of their careers, as it takes them a bit longer to mature into that role. It takes many years to develop the nuance required to read the game and how best to assert yourself in the contest as the last line of defence. But Ervin – with her height (192cm), wingspan, courage and timing – is playing beyond her years. In round seven, Ervin was recognised as the player of the match against the Firebirds, for her 11 gains including four intercepts, nine deflections and four rebounds. She was only penalised seven times. Overall, Ervin sits second in the league for deflections (47) and fourth for intercepts (13), putting her well and truly in contention for Super Netball's Rising Star award. Without trying to heap too much pressure on the young goal keeper's shoulders, it appears as if this young woman is going to be very important to Australia moving forward and that talent needs to be nurtured by the national high-performance system as much as possible. Ervin has already got a bit of a taste for the international stage too, playing Fast 5 for the green and gold in netball's modified version of the game last year. Speaking after the win against the Firebirds, Ervin credited her work alongside Bruce this season – after the Diamonds GK moved to the Sunshine Coast this year and was seen giving her tips at half-time – as one of the catalysts for her form. \"She's had such a big impact on my game, it's amazing how she shares her intelligence, I'm really grateful for her insight,\" Ervin told Fox Netball. Next weekend Ervin faces the best shooter in the world in Fowler-Nembhard. Watch this space.",

        "content": "One of Australia's biggest mango growers is ramping up the commercial rollout of three long-awaited mango varieties. Manbulloo Limited has just planted about 4,000 of the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties at its Ballongilly farm near Katherine, 300 kilometres south-east of Darwin. The three varieties are the result of 25 years of development from the National Mango Breeding Program and in 2022, Manbulloo was awarded their commercial rights. In Queensland a total of 20,000 trees of the new varieties were planted among 26 growers including Manbulloo. Another 26 farmers across Australia will also plant the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties, under Manbulloo's commercial rollout. New mangoes planted Manbulloo managing director Marie Piccone said most of the new varieties were being planted in Queensland. It has taken decades of work and a number of setbacks, but three mango varieties are being commercially rolled out — and finally have names. \"We're hoping for some more expansion in New South Wales, West Australia and Northern Territory,\" she said. \"We have indications now, based on trees that have been planted in the last 12 months and trees that are on order, being produced in nurseries right now, that the volume will continue to increase. \"We'll put a cap on that once we've got enough volume to supply profitable customers.\" Ms Piccone said Manbulloo would focus on selling the new mangoes to the domestic market, but had an eye on exports in the future. \"There's potential in every market in the world because these varieties taste very good and are flavoursome,\" she said. \"But in terms of which markets we will hone in on, that will be dependent on profitability and potential in the domestic market.\" Planting at Ballongilly The 4,000 new mangoes planted at Ballongilly took six people just five days to put in the ground. Farm manager Trevor Nelson said one of the big challenges was keeping wallabies away from the young trees. \"We've put up a big fence around them to try and prevent any wallabies from getting in,\" Mr Nelson said. \"So far it's working. Obviously wallabies can jump over but we have a big skirt on there and all we can do is try our best.\" Most of the new mangoes planted at Ballongilly were the Yess! variety. \"They were selected because they have great flavour, consistent flowering and quite a heavy yield,\" Ms Piccone said. \"In terms of the Northern Territory, the Yess! [fruits] earlier than the other places.\"",

Xavi added that even if the past few weeks have been really tough for him, his conscience is very clear. His words, “Yes, I would like a return, why not? Barcelona is the club of my life.

Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça, is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as “The Classic” (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.

Its level on May 27 remains below normal despite rains dumped by Typhoon “Aghon” over the weekend. —photo courtesy of Norzagaray Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office PLARIDEL, BULACAN, Philippines — The drop in the water level of Angat Dam and the plan to cut supply to rice fields by May 30 will not affect farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces who depend on the reservoir for their irrigation needs, a leader of a farmers’ group said. Despite Angat Dam’s current elevation of below 180 meters above sea level (masl), farmers would no longer require the water it supplies to their fields since many have harvested their rice crops since late April until early in the month, said Carlos Dimaapi, acting president of the more than 22,000 Angat Maasim River Irrigation System (Amris) farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga. READ: Angat Dam water level at 178 meters, still below operating level of 180 The continuous release of water by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) until May 30 will be enough to allow the remaining farmers to harvest good quality rice crops, he added in a phone interview on Friday. The farmers began planting for the dry season in December last year and January this year in time for the May harvest period. On Monday, because of the rains brought by Typhoon “Aghon” (international name: Ewiniar) over the weekend, the water level of Angat Dam reached 179.80 masl, slightly higher than its 178.86 masl on Sunday but still below its operating level of 180 masl and its spilling level of 212 masl. Liza Sacdalan, president of the Central Luzon Organic Rice Producers Association Inc. and the Plaridel-Guiguinto Irrigators Association that is under Amris, also affirmed they have no objection to cutting the water supply to their farms. “The cutoff is accepted because no one will need the supply. It is harvest season already until last week,” Sacdalan told the Inquirer in a text message on Sunday. Sacdalan said that despite the dry spell brought on by the El Niño phenomenon, which started last December and was projected to end by this month, many of them were still able to plant and harvest good crops because of enough water supply from the dam. Angat Dam supplies water to more than 27,000 hectares in the Bulacan towns of Norzagaray, San Rafael, Angat, Baliwag, Bustos, Plaridel, Calumpit, Pulilan, Hagonoy, Paombong, Bocaue, Bulakan, Pandi, Balagtas and Guiguinto and the City of Malolos; and the towns of San Simon, Apalit, San Luis and Candaba in Pampanga. NIA, which manages the dam’s water supplied to irrigated fields in the two provinces, regularly released 40 to 32 cubic meters per second volume of water to the fields since January, which it gradually reduced as the water level dropped.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Kanlaon recorded 24 volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes between 1:35 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on May 26, which occurred at depths of up to 6 kilometers beneath the western flank of its edifice.

READ: Fire at Mt. Kanlaon rages for 2 days now The ongoing VT earthquake activity indicated shallow rock-fracturing on the edifice, which may lead to further unrest, Phivolcs added. Phivolcs reminded the public that alert level 1 still prevailed over Kanlaon, indicating that the volcano’s condition remained abnormal.

        "content": "Julie Amos (right) talking to her players during the rout of Malaysia. —CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Gilas Pilipinas crushed one opponent after another in Thailand to punch a return ticket to the Fiba U-18 Women’s Asia Cup Division B. The young Nationals cut Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia down to size, winning by a whopping average 37.3 points in the short tournament held in Ratchaburi province.Still, coach Julie Amos feels there is plenty of polishing that her charges could do right before they plunge into action in the main tournament set in Shenzen, China, late next month. “We have always emphasized attack mentality—that everyone should run and push the ball. We have been consistent on that. But I will continue to polish [the girls] offensively,” Amos, a member of the women’s program brain trust, told the Inquirer on Monday. “There were situations that we needed to slow down to see mismatches and needed timing,” she pointed out. “We [also] need to be more consistent with our rotations and individual stops.” Overall, Amos feels that Gilas needs to improve on its maturity as it’s a trait that will allow the squad to be patient in certain situations. It was, somehow, what the team lacked in its overtime meltdown against Malaysia in the Division B semifinals two years ago in Bangalore, India. Amos is steadfast in her belief that Gilas can apply the necessary tweaks just in time, especially with promising players at her disposal. Aside from the ever-improving Ava Fajardo and hands-down the tournament’s finest scorer, Alicia Villanueva, Amos sees a lot of promise in Gabby Ramos and Tiff Reyes. “[Gabby] has been so solid inside and out and really contributes well offensively and defensively. There was this one game where she made 29 points and 19 rebounds,” said Amos, adding Ramos is a “complete package” like Villanueva.

        "content": "Carlo Paalam.–CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Carlo Paalam’s Olympic route is marked with several stops at the ongoing World Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand. After making short work of Alexei Lagkazasvili of Greece in his opening bout in the men’s 57-kilogram division, Paalam’s next layover is the round of 32 on Tuesday where Turkmenistan’s Shukur Ovezov awaits. “I’ll just have to continue what I’ve started,’’ said Paalam in Filipino after his final shot for the 2024 Paris Olympics got going with a trouble-free 5-0 win over Lagkazasvili. The Tokyo Olympics silver medalist showed no trace of an injured shoulder in that fight and will climb the ring opposite Ovezov at Indoor Stadium Huamark fresh from a three-day rest.“Very good start for Carlo. It’s great to see him back from the shoulder injury,’’ said Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines secretary general Marcus Manalo. Paalam is looking to even up matters with Ovezov, who showed him the door in the first world Olympic qualifier in Busto Arsizio, Italy, two months ago. “Coincidentally, his next opponent will be the Turkmen whom he lost to due to injury. But he’s in good shape for now and moving very well,’’ said Manalo.Back then, the 25-year-old from Talakag, Bukidnon, was already nursing a painful shoulder in an earlier bout before dropping his round of 16 match against Ovezov. Mexico’s Andrey Bonilla slammed Paalam to the canvas in their round of 32 clash before the Filipino pugilist survived with a split-decision win.Out of the four Filipino boxers sent to Bangkok, only Paalam and Hergie Bacyadan are still in contention following the early exit of Rogen Ladon (men’s 51 kg) and Criztian Pitt Laurente (men’s 63.5 kg). Ladon dropped his initial bout against Spain’s Rafael Lozano and Laurente fell prey to a quicker Mukhammedsabyr Bazarbay Uulu of Kazakhstan in their round of 64 face-off.Bacyadan, another promising Olympic prospect, drew Spain’s Dunia Mas Martinez in her initial bout in the women’s 75-kg division. If she survives Martinez, the vovinam world champion from Kalinga should get past two more opponents on June 1 and June 2 to join Eumir Marcial (men’s 80 kg), Nesthy Petecio (women’s 57 kg) and Aira Villegas (women’s 50 kg) in the French capital in July. Paalam needs to beat three more opponents after Ovezov since only the medalists in his division will earn those Paris berths. Although rougher roads lay ahead, coaches Ronald Chavez and Elmer Pamisa, Paalam’s trainer as a youth in Cagayan de Oro City, are optimistic that their ward could weather the challenges.

        "content": "Christian Standhardinger (with ball) has been working hard on that mid-range game. —PBA IMAGES Around April last year, Christian Standhardinger candidly spoke about approaching the game differently in a bid to get the most out of his aging knees. A little over a year later, the Barangay Ginebra ace continues to play splendidly, emerging as the club’s foremost weapon in a grueling seven-game semifinal showdown with tough-as-nails Meralco in the PBA Philippine Cup. “You just try to read what the defense is giving you and that’s what it was,” he said, with his signature deadpan expression, after an 89-84 Game 5 victory at Mall of Asia Arena that had the crowd darlings taking control of the series. “Coach (Tim Cone) tells me to shoot [the basketball] if [I am] open. So obviously, I took it. But, it’s more about the decision-making,” he added. “The challenge for me—or for us—this semifinals run is they (the Bolts) change a lot of the coverage and I’m just trying to make the right reads and make the right decisions.” Standhardinger had 34 points and 10 rebounds that night, bringing his semifinal averages to 22.8 points and 9.8 rebounds. He could’ve easily had more if not for the effort he also puts into playmaking. The top pick of the 2017 Rookie Draft there is nothing drastic behind his sustained fine play this series. “My prep doesn’t change. But what I’ve changed is my reaction to what they do,” he said of the Bolts, who have been trying their darndest in putting up a challenge from the battle-hardened Raymond Almazan to rookie Brandon Bates. “I’m just trying to make the right reads and I think we have a great video analyst with Pat (Partosa) and the rest of the coaching staff. So just watching film, and listening to what they have to say, helps a lot, too,” he added. Cone, however, did not let Standhardinger continue to make his feat seem minor. “If you saw us in practice, you’ll see how much Christian works on that shot,” he said of his mid-range jumper which allowed the do-it-all forward to finish Game 5 with an efficient 12-for-17 shooting. “He has faith in [his shot], we have faith in it. And when guys are going to back off of him like they do [against] his drive, he’s going to be able to take that shot and make it. And he did that with a really high percentage tonight. That’s just through the really hard work that he does,” he added. INQ Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Alas Pilipinas libero Dawn Macandili-Catindig during an AVC Challenge CUp 2024 game. –MARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.net A little Faith turned Alas Pilipinas into an unpredictable force entering the semifinals of the AVC Challenge Cup. The national squad battles Kazakhstan on Tuesday at Rizal Memorial Coliseum with a championship berth at stake and will ride into that duel confident that it has a lot of weapons to counter a taller and more powerful opponent. “The bench is pretty deep. Everyone is ready to play and deliver, even Julia Coronel as a setter. It’s good for us because at least we’re a bit more unpredictable against our opponents,” ace playmaker Jia De Guzman told reporters on Sunday after dominating Chinese Taipei, 25-13, 25-21, 25-18, to complete a four-game sweep of Pool A. READ: Alas Pilipinas can win AVC Challenge Cup title says Jaja Santiago Already the first Philippine volleyball team to enter the AVC semifinals since joining the confederation’s tournaments in 1961, Alas Pilipinas gave De Guzman a different set of starters to work with against the Taiwanese. Faith Nisperos filled in for Angel Canino and delivered eight points to help out Eya Laure and Vanie Gandler in providing the firepower against the Taiwanese, proving that coach Jorge de Brito has a lot to work with if he hopes to pull of an upset against the Kazahks. “I want to maximize every chance I can get and get all the experience I can get, and show my skills every chance I can get,” the young wing spiker said after subbing for Canino, the team’s leading scorer. “I’m really grateful to get a chance and also my other teammates who played today,” she added. Nisperos and the team are unfazed by the test that now lies before them. “We have to accept every challenge and we’re going to face Kazakhstan [in the semis]. “We will make whatever effort we can do and show our teamwork. That would be our mindset [on Tuesday],” the former Ateneo ace and current Akari standout said. “We have a good mix of young players and veterans. It’s a good blend of fire, energy and composure,” De Guzman said. “We hope to maintain this until the end and learn from our past games because the elimination round was a good training ground for us. Hopefully, we can get better results going into the next round.” “Kazakhstan is a very strong team, very tall also. We experienced playing taller and stronger teams in our bracket, and we will prepare with coach Jorge on our training tomorrow,” she added.

The milestone the team completed is something the nationals can rest on. But they are ready for more “What we went through wasn’t easy and we know it won’t be easier in the future because the semifinals is a different level. We’re just going in with a positive mindset,” De Guzman said. INQ",

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "description": "Mexico is an increasingly important destination for gay tourists, so get ready for your Pride Month trip with our list of the best locations to party.The post A guide to Mexico’s hottest LGBTQ+ vacation destinations appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Are you considering a vacation to Mexico and wondering if Mexico is safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? And what is the current state of LGBTQ+ rights in Mexico? If you have your heart set on sipping authentic margaritas on a pristine beach, you’ll be delighted to know that gay rights in Mexico surpass those in many countries worldwide. Historically, Indigenous populations such as the Zapotec and Maya have long accepted sexual fluidity, and same-sex sexual acts were decriminalized in the country in 1871. Today, same-sex unions are federally recognized and same-sex marriages are performed in 18 of Mexico’s 31 states. LGBTQ+ couples are also free to adopt children. Thanks to a pair of rulings in 2015 and 2016 by Mexico’s highest judicial body, laws banning gay marriage and gay adoption in Mexico were declared unconstitutional. This year, Congress voted to ban so-called “conversion therapies.” Although Mexico is generally very gay friendly, it should be noted that some regions are more so friendly than others. Mexico City’s Zona Rosa — which spans 16 blocks and is home to more than 200 gay-owned businesses — rivals San Francisco’s Castro District. Other parts of Mexico, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Tijuana, are also considered extremely welcoming. Nowadays, a trip to Mexico often means visiting the country’s capital, so it’s worth asking: is Mexico City safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? The answer is yes. In fact, it may be one of the most gay-friendly cities in the Americas. The city’s annual Pride festival, which debuted in 1978, attracts several hundred thousand people, while other cities and towns also draw large crowds for annual festivities. Mexico is the sixth most visited vacation destination in the world, and most of the country is very LGBTQ+ friendly. But to make your gay vacation even more special, stay in a gay-friendly space. In Mexico, there are several cities and destinations known for being welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community. We’ve included some of the best below. Mexico’s capital is recognized as one of the most open and progressive cities in Latin America in terms of LGBTQ+ rights. There are many bars, clubs, restaurants and events aimed at the LGBTQ+ community in neighborhoods such as Zona Rosa and Condesa. Here are a few of its more famous bars: This Bajío city has a vibrant LGBTQ+ scene and is famous for its annual Pride march, which attracts thousands of people. Zona Chapultepec and Zona Rosa are popular areas for LGBTQ+ nightlife and events. Visit in February to get involved with Guadalajara’s month-long Carnival celebrations marking the start of Lent. Jalisco’s Pacific coast hub is a tourist destination known for its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. The Romantic Zone is the heart of the LGBTQ+ scene in Puerto Vallarta, with a wide variety of gay-friendly bars, clubs and restaurants. The city’s gay clubs are outstanding and always busy. There’s a huge variety of establishments, so you can enjoy everything from relaxed cocktail bars to strip clubs. Many bars also sell Purple Hand, a domestically produced beer marketed to the LGBTQ+ population. Winter sees Puerto Vallarta at its busiest , with top drag performers from Provincetown escaping the chill of the U.S. northeast and descending on the city’s myriad gay-run venues, bars and clubs. Although more conservative than the other cities on this list, Mérida has been developing an active and visible LGBTQ+ population in recent years. Neighborhoods such as Santiago and Santa Ana are known for being more welcoming. As for the gay bars Merida has in store, most are located downtown, on Calle 60, but it’s easy to meet like-minded people in the many cantinas, restaurants and bars around town, you’ll find acceptance and friendly tour operators to help ensure your time is memorable for all the right reasons. This Riviera Maya tourist destination has gained popularity among the LGBTQ+ population due to its relaxed and tolerant atmosphere. Quinta Avenida is the main place for nightlife and has several gay-friendly bars and clubs. This street is also home to the annual Playa Pride festival, a week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ culture and rights. These are just a few examples, but in general, most major cities and tourist destinations in Mexico tend to be quite inclusive and welcoming towards the LGBTQ+ community. The scene can vary by city and season, so it’s always a good idea to do some research before heading out and connecting with the local LGBTQ+ population by contacting local LGBTQ+ organizations or online communities to get insider tips on the best LGBTQ+ friendly establishments and events.

Levi was found about a mile downstream and was unresponsive when first responders pulled him out of the fast-moving creek near his home on Tuesday. He w as airlifted to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. The little cowboy was initially considered brain-dead but miraculously woke up from a coma. His devastated parents, Kallie and Spencer are praying for a miracle. Many in the community have been organizing fundraisers for Levi. On Saturday, the Junior Roughstock World Finals, Desert Region Rodeo, posted that each of the kids ' rode a little extra strong for Levi Wright.' Heartbreaking pictures showed the young riders on one knee, bowing their heads with cowboy hats in hand for a moments silence for little Levi. The young cowboys are pictured holding their hat and kneeling on the dirt in prayer for Levi Levi Wright, 3, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright, has been fighting for his life, since his toy tractor dove into a creek in Utah and he was found unresponsive 'Each of the kids wore blue rode for Levi,' the post read. 'They say this is the first rodeo of the entire season that each and everyone of the kids young roughstock riders had a little extra grit and try.' On the day of the ordeal, Kallie was outside watching her son playing on his tractor trailer, and ran into the house to check on her 9-month-old. Within that split second Levi had disappeared from sight. The frantic mother dove into the creek to look for her son in the raging river. Levi's devastated parents were preparing for the worst and said they planned to 'stop care and hold him close until his last breath on earth.' But, miraculously Levi woke from the coma on Thursday night, two days after he was initially expected not to survive. 'LEVI WOKE UP! I am shook, we don't know much but the doctor said it was okay for me to get excited about that and I AM! My baby is so tough!' she said.

On Sunday she wrote: 'This is an experience, I pray deep in my soul you never have to know the way I am beginning to. 'This is a roller coaster that you go on unwillingly & blindfolded, you do not know what's coming next. You just get to wait & ride it out. We are taking it day by day.' She shared the type of brain injury her son may sustain, and the unknowns that are ahead. 'The term 'Brain Injury' is very broad, there are ranges and different severities. No two brain injuries are alike, even if the accident is similar. No two brains recover or don't recover the same. 'There is a lot Medical Professionals don't know, but what they do tell you is based off legitimate medical literature and history.'

Something we almost did not have.' 'Our doctor is nothing short of outstanding and I believe with all of me that her heart is invested into him. 'Whether that is time to see if God provides a miracle to us or whether it's time for us to research, learn and process this all in order to make the most informed decisions. In the heartbreaking post, she continued to ask for prayers and 'for years to come.' She said, as 'I fear we haven't even reached the hardest part of this.' 'Every decision that Levi's Dad and I will make will be made based on what, we the two people who know him best believe he would want. In all this, he comes first.

        "description": "A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, TSA said Saturday.",
        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "( KRON ) – Eric Ferguson was arrested for a sexual assault that was committed in 2002, according to the Oakley Police Department. Oakley PD received a notification from the Combine DNA Index System (CODIS) regarding a possible DNA match from a 2002 kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor in early May. The department subsequently coordinated with the U.S. Marshals Service and a Coeur d’Alene Police Department detective. The suspect was identified as 49-year-old Eric Ferguson, who was currently residing in Rathdrum, Idaho. Ferguson formerly lived in the east Contra Costa County area at the time of the rape. On May 12, Oakley detectives, along with the United States Marshals Service, Coeur d’Alene Police Department and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office, traveled to Idaho to serve a search warrant for DNA collection from Ferguson for the case. Oakley PD detectives returned to the Bay Area to ask the Contra Costa Sheriff’s Office Laboratory to compare the samples from the search warrant and the original case. According to Oakley PD, Ferguson’s DNA directly matched the DNA collected in 2002. A judge signed a formal complaint that was filed against Ferguson on May 16. The same day, the involved agencies utilized their SWAT team to apprehend Ferguson. Ferguson was arrested and booked into the Contra Costa County Jail for rape of an incompetent person, forcible oral copulation and kidnapping for rape.",

The radio host, 53, joined her fellow judges - Alesha Dixon , Bruno Tonioli and Simon Cowell - but stood out as she chatted to hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly during the opening minutes of the live episode. Actress Amanda looked glamorous in her one-shoulder gown which featured sleeves with attached gloves. The garment's material gathered to the front but it was for another reason that fans of the show focussed their attention on the dress - many took to social media to note that they could see her nipples through the material. They joked it must have been cold in London's Hammersmith Apollo where the semi-final was taking place.

First live show and Amanda already has her nips out. Fantastic.' While someone else joked: 'Amanda has a couple of things that are live.' Another viewer posted: 'Shoutout to Amanda Holden's nipples.' And someone else shared: 'Amanda smuggling peanuts again,' while one other show fan asked: 'Bit nippy Amanda?' 'Turn on the heating for Amanda. You could hang a painting off them,' giggled someone else. While another viewer noted: 'Amanda could cut glass with her diamond nipples tonight.' Someone else wrote: 'I think Amanda Holden has a couple of points to prove tonight.' After six weeks of Britain's Got Talent auditions, the live semi-finals kicked off on Monday as eight acts competed with one another in the hope of landing themselves a valuable place in Sunday’s grand finale. Actress Amanda looked glamorous in her one-shoulder gown which featured sleeves with attached gloves Viwers joked it must have been cold in London's Hammersmith Apollo where the semi-final was taking place A further eight entrants will feature each night of the week before the final, with two acts from each evening making it through – one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. The winner will get a life-changing £250,000 cash prize and a spot on the bill of the Royal Variety Performance. The eight acts who performed on Monday night were Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust and Innocent Massuki. Also performing on Monday night’s show was the West End cast of Disney’s award-winning musical The Lion King. It comes after Simon and Amanda's children pushed the golden buzzer on Britain's Got Talent as the auditions for the series came to an end on Sunday. During the episode, Japanese skipping dancers Haribow, who somersaulted across the stage doing various tricks, left the judges almost speechless. They received a standing ovation from the audience and numerous pleas for a golden buzzer, which would put them straight through to the semi-finals and are generally used only by the judges and hosts, from the BGT fans. Alesha said she had 'none left' regarding the buzzers along with Bruno, while Simo said that he 'did not know what to say'. 'My son is literally going crazy right now,' Simon added. Simon Cowell let his son Eric and Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie gatecrash the Britain's Got Talent auditions on Sunday as they both smashed the Golden Buzzer Simon said he had 'never heard a reaction like that before' before gesturing to his son Eric, 10, to push the button after Japanese skipping dancers Haribow auditioned The audience went wild after Japanese skipping act Haribow took to the stage Haribow, a group of performers from Japan, all aged between 22 and 24, performed street dance while skipping on jump ropes His son Eric, who he shares with wife Lauren Silverman, then went over and pushed the buzzer along with Amanda's daughter Hollie, who she shares with record producer husband Chris Hughes. 'They pressed it for the audience,' Amanda said before calling the dancers 'unbelievable'. Congratulating the dance troupe, host Dec told them: 'That's never happened before.'

        "description": "Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations.The post Indian Elections: Implications for Regional Stability first appeared on Kashmir Times (Since 1954): Multi-media web news platform..",
        "content": "Altaf Hussain Wani* The world is awaiting the outcome of India’s general elections with a bated breath. The seven-phase elections will come to conclusion on June 1 and counting of votes is scheduled to take place on June 4. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under Modi’s leadership, is aiming for a third consecutive term and has set a target of over 370 seats. Media outlets that support Modi and his Hindutva philosophy predict a landslide victory for the BJP. However, independent observers believe that the opposition alliance, known as INDIA Bloc, may still pose a significant challenge, contrary to the narrative pushed by government-aligned media. While it is too early to predict the election results with certainty, one can speculate on how India’s future may unfold depending on which of the two main contenders emerges victorious. Impartial observers, who have been closely monitoring Modi’s iron-fisted rule, view the prospect of a third term as a potential risk to peace and stability in South Asia. They argue that another term for Modi could amplify India’s global ambitions and regional hegemony. The ruling party has consistently expressed its commitment to “Akhand Bharat”, a concept championed by Hindu nationalist parties that has raised concerns among India’s neighbours. A mural in the new parliament building in New Delhi, depicting ‘ancient India’ including regions now part of Pakistan and other countries, exemplifies the BJP’s promotion of this expansionist ideology. India’s neighbours have been critical of this project and are genuinely worried about the threats it poses to their territorial sovereignty. The idea of restoring the territorial unity of the Indian subcontinent under a unified Hindu-majority nation is not universally accepted and has sparked considerable controversy. This concept is supported by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP. A potential third term for the BJP is also seen as a continuation of the erosion of India’s secular and democratic principles. During Modi’s ten-year tenure, India’s secular credentials have faced substantial criticism. Since 2014, Indian society has witnessed a surge in communal conflicts, violent incidents, and an increase in xenophobia, intolerance, racism, and discrimination. Key events such as the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Ayodhya verdict and subsequent construction of the Ram Temple, appointments of Hindu nationalist sympathisers to significant positions, infusion of Hindu ideology into education and culture, restrictions on minority rights and freedoms, biased policies against Muslims and other minorities, erosion of secular institutions, and the judiciary’s apparent alignment with the BJP’s agenda have profoundly undermined India’s secular democracy. The consequences of a third term for Modi could be far-reaching and damaging to India’s secular fabric, democratic institutions, and social cohesion. Here are some potential outcomes: Hindu nationalist ideology may become further entrenched, marginalising minority communities and undermining the principles of equality and justice. #The judiciary, media, and other institutions may face increased pressure to conform to the BJP’s agenda, compromising their independence and integrity. #The concept of Hindutva (Hindu-ness) may become even more dominant, potentially leading to a formal declaration of India as a Hindu state. #Muslims, Christians, and other minorities may face heightened discrimination, violence, and exclusion from the political and social mainstream. #The promotion of Hindu-centric education, history, and culture may accelerate, suppressing diverse perspectives and India’s pluralistic heritage. #Dissent may be met with increased surveillance, censorship, and repression, silencing critical voices and undermining democratic freedoms. #The polarisation and fragmentation of Indian society may worsen, potentially leading to increased communal tensions, violence, and social unrest. #The very foundations of India’s secular democracy, enshrined in the Constitution, may be challenged or even rewritten to accommodate the BJP’s ideology. #A permanent shift towards authoritarianism may make it challenging for opposition parties to restore democratic values, secularism, and the rule of law in the future. The BJP’s stringent stance on the Jammu and Kashmir issue has resulted in heightened tensions with Pakistan, raising the possibility of escalating conflict. Additionally, India’s growing rivalry with China could lead to increased military build-up and tensions in the region. India’s aspirations for regional influence might result in a more assertive approach towards its smaller neighbours, potentially disrupting the balance of power in the region. The expansionist agenda of the BJP could escalate tensions with neighbouring nations. However, the impact of India’s emergence as a regional hegemon under the BJP will depend on how it chooses to exercise its power and influence in the region. If Narendra Modi secures a third term, his government’s policies in Jammu and Kashmir may include: #Continued crackdown on dissent , leading to increased tensions and potential human rights violations. #Increased security measures, with additional security forces and strict measures to maintain control and prevent unrest . #Promotion of Hindu nationalism, potentially altering the demographics of the region. These actions could result in the continued exclusion of the Kashmiri population and heightened polarisation and marginalisation of the majority community. Conversely, a victory for the INDIA Bloc alliance is expected to steer the country back towards secularism, protect minority rights, and recalibrate its relationships with neighbouring countries. India needs stable leadership and a unifying approach to move away from the politics of anarchy and polarisation. In just a few days, the world will learn whether Indians have voted in favour of a progressive alliance or a party that has thrived on falsehoods and communal frenzy. Tailpiece: India’s regional influence may have expanded under BJP leadership, but its advancement as a regional power remains a distant dream due to formidable challenges and competition from other regional powers. India’s aspiration to assume a leadership role in the region depends on its ability to address domestic challenges, strengthen relationships with neighbouring countries, and resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir. *The author is the chairman of the Islamabad-based think tank, Kashmir Institute of International Relations (KIIR). —–",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 21:26 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:46 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Marcus Rashford has taken the decision to remove himself from social media in the wake of a season that he's labelled 'challenging.' The Manchester United forward has endured a dramatic week at the end of a difficult season, and has seen him decide to take a complete rest from glare of social media to reset himself mentally. Last week he was left out of Gareth Southgate 's final England squad ahead of Euro 2024 , after a season where he has scored just eight goals for his club. The campaign has finished on a high note for the 26-year-old, as he helped United triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup Final on Saturday, but Rashford says he now needs a rest. Posting on his X account, he admitted it was time to come off the platforms and spoke of the support he's received from fans, and had a message for those who have not stood by him this season. Marcus Rashford has decided to take a break from social media following a challenging season The Man United forward did finish the campaign on a high note by winning the FA Cup His performances this season has seen him axed from England's squad for Euro 2024 Rashford wrote: 'It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. 'I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. 'To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.' The post comes days after Rashford was seen in tears at the end of the FA Cup Final win, as the pure emotion of a difficult season poured out of the striker. His performances have been largely criticised this season, and so much so, it's led to a snub from England manager Gareth Southgate - someone who's always been a big supporter of the striker. Asked about his decision to axe Rashford for the tournament in Germany, Southgate stated that be believed other players in his positions have just had better seasons than the Red Devils man. Rashford has scored just seven league goals all season, compared to the 17 he got last season - 30 in all competitions. His season has also been marred with off the field issues, after he embarked on a 12-hour tequila bender in Belfast back in January and then reported ill for United training. The message Rashford sent to announce his break off social media after a difficult season The emotions of the season all come to the surface in United's FA Cup victory over Man City The antics did not go down with United fans, who despite the FA Cup win have also suffered a disappointing season, finishing in their worst-ever league position . The United forward has also has to deal with the deaths of two people within his circle of family and friends, something his mother admitted during an interview with The Times, 'set him back a lot'. His performances this season has led to speculation he could be one of the big names to be sacrificed this summer, with Rashford linked with a possible move to Paris Saint-Germain . Following his post, United fans showed support for a player they've taken to calling 'king' with messages looking forward to next season with the player still at the club. 'Next season, we will see the best Rashford.' One post read, while another told their star 'Rest up & come back stronger, Rashy.' Man United fans show their backing for Rashford following his decision to mentally reset Similar themes saw posts saying 'We go again next season' and 'Come back stronger king!' Others played on the scenes they saw from Rashford during Saturday's FA Cup celebrations and said, 'We see how this club means a lot to you king'. In all, Rashford has played 402 games for club since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2015 and scored 131 goals.

        "content": "An 81-year-old man who investigators say terrorized a southern California neighborhood for years with a slingshot has been arrested, police said. While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter”, the Asuza police department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested on Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40km) east of Los Angeles, police said. The Azusa police Lt Jake Bushey said on Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group. The man was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A strong political ally of former President Buhari and the Chairman of Arewa Media Group, AbdulMajid Danbilki Kwamanda, has warned President Bola Tinubu against allowing anyone to violate court orders that stopped the reinstatement of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II . He insisted that the reinstatement of Sanusi has set a bad precedent that could affect everyone. Speaking to newsmen in Kano on Monday, Kwamanda argued that the reinstatement of the deposed Emir violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution. According to him, “ We cannot understand why the people who celebrated and effectively used the courts to maintain their government now stand firmly against a substantive court order preventing them from carrying out illegality.” “The insistence that the reinstated Emir must stay and continue parading himself as the authentic Emir of Kano violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution and general well-being.” To this end, the political ally of former President Buhari called on Tinubu to urgently intervene in the matter to bring peace and stability to the state. He said, “ Although I’m a politician, honestly, this time around, politics aside, there is great danger in what the Kano State Government is doing. The court injunction must be respected to allow peace to reign. “Why is controversy associated with the reinstated Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II? Look at how he was removed from office by former President Goodluck Jonathan and the reasons for his removal. Now, are you returning him to continue anarchy in Kano or what?” Danbilki Kwamanda urged President Tinubu to act accordingly as a respecter of law and order, a reputation he is known for. “ You should not allow this bad precedent to be set during your tenure. You should ensure that everyone respects the law by stopping the reinstatement,” he added.",

        "content": "Chad’s newly appointed Prime Minister, Allamaye Halina, unveiled his inaugural government on Monday, signalling the conclusion of a three-year period of military governance in the arid nation. Naija News reports that the cabinet decree, broadcasted on public television, retained senior ministers who are predominantly supporters of President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Halina, a former ambassador to China, assumed office on Thursday, just prior to junta leader Deby’s presidential inauguration following a disputed election victory. The new government will consist of 35 ministers, with 23 individuals carrying over from the previous administration. Halina succeeded his predecessor, Succes Masra, who resigned last Wednesday after losing the presidential election. Masra, an economist, held office for only four months. Notably, none of the ministers from Masra’s Transformers party were included in the new government lineup. Deby officially secured 61% of the vote on May 6, a result criticized by international NGOs as lacking credibility and freedom. His main opponent denounced it as a “masquerade.” Before taking office, Deby announced a restoration of the constitutional system and committed to being a president for all Chadians, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs. It is important to remember that Deby assumed the role of interim president in April 2021, following the assassination of his father, President Idriss Deby Itno, by rebel forces after ruling for three decades. Chad, a country known as one of the poorest in the world, holds significant importance in the global effort to combat the spread of jihadist groups in the Sahel region.",

        "content": "Former member of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Yusuf, has revealed that it might be impossible for Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar to work together in the 2027 presidential election. Naija News reports that Yusuf, who was speaking on the premise of recent possible merger talks between Obi and Atiku, argued that he does not see the possibility of a merger between the two politicians. He said, “They worked together before in 2019, so it would not be out of place if they worked together again. However, I am not in their mind, but I do not see the possibilities. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Atiku Abubakar came out to say he would continue to contest as long as he is alive and healthy, to me that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with a notion that Atiku Abubakar might step down; shelve his political ambition for Peter Obi, but the follow-up statement a week later clarified that. “So I believe that Atiku Abubakar is going to contest I believe that Peter Obi is going to contest in 2027 if the two of them can create a compromise, fantastic for the opposition but i doubt if such will happen. “I love the statement made by the spokesperson of the Obi campaign organisation here, he clearly stated that this talk individuals have to be subjected to the individual’s parties, so we will now sit down, which of the parties should be the leading party, naturally it should be the PDP, but is Peter Obi ready to play second fiddle in this arrangement and will Peter Obi still have his base with him if he ceases to be presidential candidate those are the things you need to look into.”",

        "content": "In the world of modern romance, there is a plethora of dating and breakup lingos. A not-so-gentle breakup trend called ‘delicate dumping’ has become the go-to weapon for toxic lovers who want to split from their partners. Delicate dumping is a breakup trend where a person resorts to detachment, cold communication, occasional ghosting, and lack of effort in the name of nudging their partner to the exit. This toxic trend thrives on communication as clear as a foggy mirror, often resorting to cowardly tactics to ‘gently’ bid adieu.",

        "content": "There has been no shortage of emotional outpouring and tributes in the wake of Bill Walton 's passing. One of the most heartfelt and heartbreaking has been, without a doubt, from Dave Pasch. The longtime ESPN announcer, who broadcasted games alongside Walton for over a decade, spoke to the network on Monday about his incredible bond with the late great basketball Hall of Famer. \"He'd take the headset off during a commercial break and just say to me, 'I love you, but don't tell anybody,\" Pasch told SportsCenter. \"I think he enjoyed the fact that I was his sparring partner and that he could have fun with me and just take shots at me and that I knew it was all part of the game.\" \"I love you, but don't tell anybody.\" Bill Walton's longtime broadcast partner @DavePasch reflects on one of his favorite memories of his friend ❤️ pic.twitter.com/zcBDQHlBOp There was no shortage of shenanigans when Pasch called basketball games alongside Walton. High notes from their broadcasts together included Walton bringing Pasch odd gifts, changing his t-shirt mid-broadcast and, quite famously, eating a lit candle on live TV. The No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft and 1993 Hall of Fame inductee started his broadcasting career in 2002 as a pro basketball analyst for ESPN and ABC. Pasch joined ESPN the following year and the duo went on to be a regular fixture calling college basketball games. Walton, a two-time NCAA champion with the UCLA Bruins and two-time NBA champion, passed away following a long battle with cancer. He was 71 years old.",

        "content": "A bike rider in Vadodara was injured and his wife and two children had a narrow escape on Sunday night after a bus rammed a green shade at the Akota Dandia Bazar signal, pulling it down, said police. The Vadodara Traffic Police, which had put up the shades at three junctions, has decided to remove the structures. The bus driver is set to be booked for negligence, officials said on Monday. The green shade – supported by iron pillars — was installed just a day before the incident to provide relief to drivers during the heatwave. The incident occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday when the luggage carrier of the luxury bus was passing the Akota Dandia Bazar flyover and got stuck in the green mat, pulling down the structure. Amid the collapse, Nivritt More (40), a bike rider, was injured while his wife and two children had a narrow escape. More suffered minor injuries on his right leg and was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Jyoti Patel, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vadodara Traffic Police, told The Indian Express that the traffic police had begun the process to identify the driver of the luxury bus to book a case of ‘negligent driving’. “We had erected the shades at three traffic junctions with the intention of providing relief to motorists in wake of the heat wave. The driver of the luxury bus was negligent as he was aware that the height of the shade was lower than the height of the bus he was driving. He should not have attempted to cross the shade and put other motorists at risk. We are identifying the driver and booking a case of negligence,” Patel said. Patel said that the shade was erected on Saturday as the mercury soared in Vadodara; however, the police have decided to remove the shades following Sunday’s incident “We have decided to remove the shades as negligent drivers can cause such mishaps. We are fortunate that we did not have any major accidents at this spot yesterday. Also, the temperatures have dipped and the orange alert for heatwave has been withdrawn so the shades are not needed anymore,” Patel said.",

        "content": "Reports from the Central Bank of the Iranian regime indicate that government debts to the banking system have doubled during Ebrahim Raisi’s presidency, and the government’s has worsened. The Central Bank of the Iranian regime recently released annual budget details for the period from 2017 to 2020, showing an annual deficit of 30%. Despite this, the Central Bank has still refrained from reporting on the budget realization status during Raisi’s term. In 2018, then–president Hassan Rouhani had instructed the Central Bank to stop publishing the country’s budget realization reports, citing the need to keep government information confidential due to US sanctions. Pro-government media in the Iranian regime are attempting to highlight the 5% growth in GDP in 2023 as a success for Raisi. However, details from the Statistical Center’s report show that the only reason for the relatively higher GDP growth last year was a 21.8% increase in and a 16.7% increase in government spending. Meanwhile, none of the mentioned GDP growth drivers have had a positive impact on people’s livelihoods and are not sustainable. In March, after a six-month halt, the Central Bank of the Iranian regime published the inflation report for December of the previous year, which indicated that the 2023 broke the 49% record set in 1995. According to the Central Bank, in December 2023, the point-to-point urban inflation rate was 54.2% and the average urban inflation rate was 55.9%. However, in March and April, the Central Bank, in its debt and dowry payment calculation table, announced the annual inflation rate for 2024 to be 52.3%, the highest annual inflation rate in the past 80 years. At the same time, the Statistical Center of Iran, by publishing the point-to-point inflation rate for 2023, announced that among commodities, various types of meat led the price increases with a 50.9% inflation rate. According to published statistics, the inflation rate this year was 32.24%, and the public transportation services sector topped the price increases with 58% inflation. Inflation in Iran has been increasing daily, and a recent report from the Statistical Center at the end of May showed that inflation in the red meat and poultry group was about 74% in the 12 months leading up to May 2024. According to this report, inflation in the housing sector was over 40%. Official reports, including the report from the Parliamentary Research Center, show that the pressure from rising costs on one hand and the lack of proportionate wage increases on the other has caused families to reduce their consumption of food and beverages. According to a report published by the Parliamentary Research Center in April and May 2024, the calorie intake of Iranians in 2022 was below the standard level. According to official data recorded on changes in the rental index, the highest growth record in rental rates in the history of recorded rental data was registered under the 13th government. Rental rates jumped by 44% and 52% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, which is unprecedented in Iran’s economic history since the rental index was recorded. Tejarat News website, in a comparative report, announced: “ ‘s government holds the record for the highest increase in gold coin prices in the first two and a half years of activity among the governments of the past 40 years.” According to this report, in the first 32 months of the 13th government’s activity, the price of gold coins jumped by 291%, the highest increase among the post-1979 revolution governments. In the first two and a half years of Hassan Rouhani’s government, the price of gold coins increased by 11%. The price of the dollar also grew by 160% in the first two and a half years of Raisi’s government, whereas it had increased by 10% in the first 32 months of Rouhani’s government.",

        "content": "Chinese doctors say they've CURED diabetes in man, 59, using stem cell therapy in a world-first By Connor Boyd Health And Science Editor For Dailymail.Com and Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 21:18, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:56, 27 May 2024 e-mail 6 View comments Researchers in China say they have cured diabetes for the first time. The patient, a 59-year-old man, received a pioneering cell transplant in 2021 and has been medication-free since 2022. The experimental treatment involved creating an artificial version of cells found in the pancreas that produce insulin and keep blood sugar levels in check. The man had suffered from type 2 diabetes for 25 years and had lost almost all function of these cells, known as islets. He was deemed high risk of deadly complications, requiring multiple insulin injections every day to prevent him from going into a diabetic coma. The pancreas is an organ which, amongst other functions, produces insulin. Insulin is a natural hormone that our body uses to control the amount of sugar in our blood stream. People with diabetes have trouble regulating their blood sugar because of pancreatic dysfunction. People with diabetes often use blood sugar monitors, like this one pictured, to determine how much sugar is currently circulating in their blood stream. This helps them decide what to eat and when to use insulin to best manage their disease. Up to this point, no one has ever been 'cured' of diabetes, but doctors have figured out how to put it into remission. But this requires patients to keep up a relatively strict diet and exercise program to stop the blood sugar problems returning. However, the case in China suggests it's possible to restore the body's ability to naturally regulate blood-sugar without a patient changing their lifestyle. The treatment used stem cells, which are a blank-slate kind of cell that can be turned into the many different types of cells the body needs to function. Under the right conditions, stem cells can turn into brain, muscle, kidney or even pancreas tissue. This treatment used a new chemical cocktail to turn the patient's stem cells into pancreas cells. These cells produce insulin, which tells your body when to pull sugar from the food we eat for energy. In diabetics, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar. Too much or too little sugar in the blood can cause nerve damage, kidney damage, heart disease and more. Read More Revolutionary treatment for type 1 diabetes could see cells that act like the pancreas transplanted into patients' arms By implanting the new, lab-grown cells, which can produce insulin, the patient could begin producing their own insulin again, researchers suggest. This is what doctors have observed in the Chinese patient. 'I think this study represents an important advance in the field of cell therapy for diabetes,' Timothy Kieffer, a professor of cellular and physiological sciences at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved with the research, told South China Morning Post . Though this finding is encouraging, there's still a ways to go before it can be approved for the masses. Next, scientists will have to test their therapy in more patients. After they test it in more people, Professor Kieffer said, they'll need to find a way to scale up their operation. Currently, turning blank 'seed cells' into functioning pancreas cells is incredibly intricate, time-consuming and expensive. Scientists will have to make the process easier if it's going to be feasible for most people. There is a chance it might only work to treat type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease. Type 1 diabetics, whose pancreas has been attacked by the immune system, might have a harder time using this treatment because their immune system might reject the new implanted cells, the study authors wrote. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement Regardless of all the hurdles still left to cross, this could be a huge step forward for the 38.4 million Americans currently living with diabetes and the 97.6 million who will likely go on to develop the disease. It's the eighth leading cause of death in the country. This paper, which was published in the journal Cell Discovery is the result of decades of research, across many countries, into how best to turn stem cells into islet cells, and how to get those islet cells into the body. 'Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes,' Dr Yin Hao, one of the lead researchers said. The study was a collaboration between three institutions based in Shanghai -the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Renji Hospital. In the future, Professor Kieffer said this therapy may, 'free patients from the burden of chronic medications, improve health and quality of life, and reduce healthcare expenditures.'

        "content": "After making significant strides in his second NFL season, Giants edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux has his sights set on taking yet another leap in 2024. Thibodeaux, the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, flashed upside as a rookie but only racked up 49 tackles, including six for a loss, and four sacks. Although he started and ended 2023 sluggishly, Thibodeaux finished the year with 11.5 sacks, the 12th-most in the NFL. Now back in East Rutherford for his third year of organized team activities, Thibodeaux recently told reporters he's doing \"everything\" he can to \"take that next step\" toward greatness. “Last year I was able to get 11 and a half sacks,” Thibodeaux said , via Pro Football Talk's Josh Alper. “Those are the accolades. Now it’s about getting that respect throughout the league, having teams fear coming to play against us. Just taking everything I do to the next level as far as that extra. Greatness is optional. I just got to kind of take that next step.” Prior to Thursday's OTAs session, Thibodeaux also made it clear that \"every year\" he's with the Giants, he's gunning for his mentor and Giants legend Michael Strahan's single-season sack record of 22.5. While no player has yet to top Strahan's impressive feat, it's worth noting that Steelers LB T.J. Watt tied the record during the 2021 season. Despite his confidence and last season's increased production, Thibodeaux has a long way to go before he can be considered one of the NFL's top edge-rushers and have a chance to break the single-season sack record. As mentioned, Thibodeaux struggled to maintain consistency last season. Not only did he go his first two games of the season without a sack, but he also failed to collect one across his final four games. During those six games, Thibodeaux made just five solo tackles, three of which came in New York's 27-10 Week 18 win over Philadelphia. Additionally, Thibodeaux's underlying metrics from last season show that he wasn't nearly as dominant as his sack total suggests. According to Pro Football Focus , Thibodeaux posted a 6.4 pass-rush win rate in 2023, ranking 101st among all qualified edge-rushers. The total was also substantially lower than the 9.7 pass-rush win rate he posted as a rookie, which would've still only ranked 77th among edges this past season. Nonetheless, considering the Giants are implementing a different scheme under new DC Shane Bowen and the team added two-time Pro Bowl edge-rusher Brian Burns earlier this offseason, Thibodeaux is well-positioned to continue his ascent.",

        "description": "The Indianapolis Colts could be scary in 2024, at least second-year quarterback Anthony Richardson believes so.",
        "content": "At least one member of the believes the team's offense is ready to cook in 2024. Michael Pittman Jr., who with the team this offseason, : I think we could have the best RPO [run-pass option] game in the whole NFL. We went to the RPO a lot last year, and just being able to add Anthony's legs, I mean, he can add in a whole other aspect which is you can't really load up that box. He can pull it and throw it. You can't really [concentrate] most of the defense towards J.T. There are reasons for Pittman's optimism. Two of those reasons are quarterback and running back Jonathan Taylor. Both are healthy after injuries affected them in 2023. In fact, the two barely played together in 2023. As ESPN notes, Richardson got hurt as Taylor returned from injury, and the pair hardly spent any time together on the field. Key Players Return for the Colts Taylor started 2023 late due to an ankle injury and a contract dispute, while Richardson was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Jonathan Taylor 2023 Stats Games Played 10 Rushing Attempts 169 Rushing Yards 741 Rushing Touchdowns 7 Receptions 19 Receiving Yards 153 Receiving Touchdowns 1 Fumbles 1 Pittman Jr. himself is still developing into a key weapon, and other young Colts such as Josh Downs and Alec Pierce have more experience under their belts now. The Colts also will get tight end Jelani Woods back as he will be recovering from injury, and the team added wide receiver Adonai Mitchell via the . That gives Indianapolis an offense full of young, talented skill players. Head coach that things are looking up for the Colts: It's fun and it's exciting. Every week, we'll have things [in the game plan] for every single guy. As far as the scheme goes, it's exciting to have a whole bunch of guys that you can do a whole bunch of different things with. According to ESPN, Steichen has spent a lot of time in his office, working on the best ways to utilize this offense against opponents by creating the best possible matchups. The coach loves to use multiple personnel groupings, and the versatility offered by this group of skill-position players gives him a lot of options. He's also open to feedback from his players. We just toss ideas around. He asks me how I feel about certain things, and, then if I see certain things on the internet, like if I see a sweep or an option play or something like that, I'll say 'Hey, that's kind of nice.' I'll show it to him and he'll be like, 'OK, we might be able to throw that in.' It's amazing to have a coach like that because we get to use our offense and use our weapons. Even with backups Gardner Minshew and Zack Moss playing, the Colts managed to be 10th in the NFL with 23.3 points per game. The Colts also managed 336.8 yards per game. to get back on the horse and lead this young team to great things in 2024: \"We've got young athletes, people who can run... It's going to be a crazy year. Perhaps just crazy enough that the Colts, who missed the playoffs due to a loss in the regular-season finale, will be in the postseason at the end of the year. Anthony Richardson's injury-plagued first four games were still historic: his 136 rushing yards were 9th-most for a QB in his first four career games, and his four rushing TDs were tied for 1st with Cam Newton and RG3.

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a...",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Although Goldberg never wrestled Eddie Guerrero, the WWE Hall of Famer did wrestle Chavo. (per Fightful ) “That Guerrero family had such a huge impact on me when I was coming up. They would take the time, unlike others, who felt threatened, they would take the time to make sure I knew the basics. Whether it was Eddie or Chavo. Chavo was great with me. The entire family, I have nothing but found memories with all of our interactions. In this day and age, a lot of people have ulterior motives. That family never had an ulterior motive, just an effort to make you better than you were before. That, you have to take your hat off to and cover your heart for, and you have to be appreciative that you run into people with such good character.”",

        "content": "Richard Dreyfuss’ appearance at a Massachusetts theater’s screening of Jaws went off the rails when the actor went on a sexist and homophobic rant, prompting the venue to issue an apology. “The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.

However, things took a sharp turn when, according to social media posts from attendees, the Oscar-winning actor began sharing offensive comments about women and trans youth. According to one attendee , Dreyfuss called Barbra Streisand a “genius” but said he “didn’t listen to her because she is a woman and women shouldn’t have that power.” The same attendee said Dreyfuss—who was clad in a housedress and waving a cane, according to Deadline —then claimed that “you shouldn’t be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.” More attendees shared on the theater’s Facebook page that they walked out of the event because of Dreyfuss’ inflammatory remarks. One person wrote, “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred[s] of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic [sic] rant.” Another attendee posted: “richard dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice.” The Daily Beast has reached out to Dreyfuss’ representative for comment. This isn’t the first time Dreyfuss’ views have landed him in hot water. Last year, during an interview on PBS’s Firing Line , the actor blasted the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences’ new diversity and inclusion rules while defending actors using blackface. “They make me vomit,” he said of the academy’s rules. “Because this is an art form. It’s also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it’s an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.”",

        "content": "EAMONN Holmes is facing fresh heartbreak following his split from Ruth Langsford — the loss of custody of their beloved dog Maggie. The pooch, 14, which the former This Morning presenters adopted in 2011, is said to be like a “second child” to them, even appearing with the pair on the ITV show. Ruth shared a video of herself walking Collie cross Maggie on Sunday — her first post since the couple told The Sun their 14-year marriage was over. They said they had been living separate lives for two years and Eamonn , who has faced health struggles of late, had recently moved out. Pals said he and Ruth are now having “difficult conversations” over who gets the dog. The pair, both 64, are trying to avoid calling in lawyers like Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong did when they rowed about their mutt Hurley. A source said: “Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she’s getting on and they know she needs stability. \"It’s a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie’s been such a support during his health woes . \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. “But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split . “They are adamant this won’t come to what Ant and Lisa went through and they won’t be getting lawyers involved.” Eamonn, who has a son, Jack, 22, with Ruth, spoke earlier this year of Maggie’s “unconditional love” and the joy she brings to his life. He said: “I genuinely have never experienced affection like it.” Friends said he and Ruth drifted apart when they were taken off This Morning in 2021. Insiders said Ruth wanted a fresh start while admitting Eamonn believed they could salvage something. Ruth will not appear on Loose Women this week following the news of their divorce . Eamonn is expected to return to GB News’ Breakfast Show today. Pals do not know if he will address their split on air. Before the shock split announcement, Ruth and Eamonn seemed like one of the strongest couples on UK TV – even with their signature bickering style. Here's how their romance played out 1997 - The couple first meet after being introduced by mutual friends, two years after Eamonn splits from his first wife, Gabrielle, with whom he has three children. 1997-2002 - To be respectful to Gabrielle, the couple kept their relationship out of the limelight. Ruth told Daily Mail : \"I thought it spoke volumes about the sort of man he was, the sort of father he was and the integrity he had. It made me love him more, not less.\" 2002 - Ruth and Eamonn welcome their son, Jack, to the family 2005 - Eamonn finalises his divorce with Gabrielle 2006 - The pair begin to host Friday episodes of This Morning together 2010 - Eamonn proposes to Ruth while at the Cheltenham Races, after asking Ruth's mother for her hand June 2010 - Eamonn and Ruth marry at Elvetham Hall, Hampshire 2016 - Eamonn undergoes a double hip replacement in the first of many health battles. June 2019 - On This Morning, Ruth and Eamonn say the secret to their happy marriage. Eamonn credits \"compromise, consideration and lots of conjugals,\" while Ruth said it was \"laughter and an equal marriage\" November 2020 - Ruth and Eamonn are replaced on their regular Friday slot by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary in a 'show shake-up' December 202 1 - After a year of being moved to the bank holiday presenting slot, both Eamonn and Ruth left This Morning January 2022 - Eamonn makes his debut on GB News, while Ruth stayed with ITV in her long-standing role on Loose Women. September 2022 - Eamonn undergoes spinal surgery after years of back issues including a trapped sciatic nerve. November 2022 - Eamonn falls down the stairs of his Surrey home with Ruth and breaks his shoulder, requiring a new operation September 2023 - Eamonn has a spine and neck stretching procedure as part of his year-long recovery May 2024 - Ruth and Eamonn announce they have split after 14 years of marriage and 27 year relationship",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "description": "Walton supported the 'Conference of Champions' like nobody else during his career as a broadcaster for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network.",
        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. He loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday, first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues. The Pac-12 will remain an official conference for at least two years as the Washington State and Oregon State football teams compete during a grace period provided by the NCAA. Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them. It was the only conference that the champion of the ‘Conference of Champions’ ever knew. *** Send suggestions, comments and tips (confidentiality guaranteed) to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com or call 408-920-5716 *** Follow me on Twitter/X: @ WilnerHotline *** Pac-12 Hotline is not endorsed or sponsored by the Pac-12 Conference, and the views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the views of the Conference.",

        "content": "The Connecticut Sun are off to their third 5-0 start in franchise history, and their past four wins were decided by a combined 16 points. Coming off another close win, the Sun attempt to start a season with six straight wins for the first time Tuesday night when they host the Phoenix Mercury in Uncasville, Conn. The Sun are off to the same five-win start as the 2021 and 2018 seasons. After opening with a 21-point rout of Indiana, Connecticut earned a seven-point victory over Washington, a four-point win at Indiana and a one-point overtime home win over Minnesota. Connecticut kept the unbeaten start going on Saturday when it earned an 86-82 win at Chicago thanks to DeWanna Bonner, who leads the team in scoring at 20.6 points. Bonner scored eight of her 19 points in the fourth quarter. Bonner scored five straight points to spark a 7-0 run that turned a one-point Sun deficit into a 85-79 lead with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining in regulation. Bonner started by missing her first five 3-point attempts, and her big fourth quarter helped the Sun overcome Alyssa Thomas getting ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant foul against Chicago rookie Angel Reese. \"Certainly you don't want to have your MVP off the floor. She was on her way to a triple-double,\" Sun coach Stephanie White said of Thomas, who had nine points, six assists and six rebounds before the ejection. \"But everybody stepped up, and for us to be successful, that's what it's going to take.\" After winning three straight and holding their first four opponents to 42.3 percent shooting or lower, the Mercury (3-2) were handed a 107-92 loss to the Dallas Wings on Saturday. Phoenix allowed 52 percent shooting and a 40-point game to Arike Ogunbowale while struggling in the paint and on the glass. The Mercury experienced their worst struggles on the inside while Britney Griner continued to recover from a fractured toe. They were outrebounded 38-25 and outscored 52-26 in the paint. \"This is one of those games where we got dominated inside,\" Phoenix coach Nate Tibbetts said. \"Give them credit, that's their strength. They took full advantage tonight.\" Kahleah Copper led the Mercury with 32 points for her third 30-point game of the season; she now leads the league with 29.2 points per game. Diana Taurasi added 28 but Phoenix struggled to overcome a 17-point halftime deficit. This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Figma is a potent design tool that has swiftly risen to the top of the UI/UX design field. Figma is a useful tool for designers of all experience levels to have in their toolbox. We’ll go over some essential stages in this blog post to assist you in learning Figma as a novice. Learn How to Use the Interface of Figma Getting acquainted with Figma’s interface is the first step towards learning it. Although Figma’s UI is simple to use and straightforward, it may take some getting accustomed to. Take some time to explore the various menus and panels, and see how they interact with one another. To gain a better understanding of how Figma functions , you may also have a peek at some of the pre-made designs and templates. Acquire Knowledge of the Fundamental Tools After you’ve become comfortable with the interface, it’s time to master the fundamental tools. Although Figma has a large toolkit, all you need to know to get started are a few fundamental ones. These consist of the text tool, pen tool, shape tool, and selection tool. Take some time to experiment and become familiar with these tools. Practice Creating Simple Layouts The following action is to practice creating simple layouts. Start with something basic, such as a login screen or landing page. When creating the layout, use the fundamental skills you’ve learned and pay attention to small elements like typography, spacing, and alignment. You can start by using one of the many templates available in Figma, but it’s also a good idea to try creating something from scratch. Play Around with Prototyping Design processes must include prototyping, and Figma makes it simple to produce interactive prototypes. Try out various animations and interactions while you create prototypes for your projects. Don’t be scared to try new things—Figma’s prototyping tools are user-friendly and straightforward to use. Participate in the Figma Community Getting involved in the Figma community is one of the greatest ways to learn Figma . Numerous online tools, guides, and discussion boards are available for you to interact with other designers and gain knowledge from their experiences. You can get access to templates, design materials, and other resources that will help you further your career by becoming a member of the Figma community. Figma’s ability to facilitate real-time collaboration on a single file is another significant benefit. If designers wish to share their work created with traditional “offline” tools such as Sketch and Illustrator, they usually have to export it to an image file and then transmit it by email or instant messaging. Rather than exporting still photographs from Figma, we can just send clients and colleagues a link to the Figma file, which they can examine in their web browsers. This alone can expedite a designer’s process and save a significant amount of time. More significantly, though, it allows clients and coworkers to engage with the work more deeply and examine the most recent version of the file. Create An Account on Figma. It’s easy to get started with Figma. Just visit www.figma.com, select “Get started,” fill out your information, and finish a short verification task. After you complete that, Figma will lead you to a screen containing a few additional onboarding questions before launching a project file that has some samples of what you can produce using the tool. Continue Learning and Practicing Figma Ultimately, continuing to study and practice is the key to becoming an expert in Figma. Figma is always changing, with new tools and features being released on a regular basis. Remain current with the most recent advancements and continue honing your design abilities. To sum up, if you’re just starting out with Figma, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the interface, understand the fundamental tools, practice creating simple layouts, try out prototyping, connect with the Figma community, and never stop learning and improving. These steps will help you quickly become proficient with Figma. Explore the Figma User Interface The Figma interface has a simple appearance and feel, yet it conceals a number of useful capabilities. The major sections of the interface (identified above) are explained as follows. Launch a Fresh Design File Now that you’re familiar with the layout, let’s get started creating! To begin a new project, click the Menu button (the Figma logo) in the upper left corner, choose File, and then choose “New design file.” When you do this, your browser should automatically open a new tab and generate a new file with an empty canvas. Conclusion We hope this overview aids in helping you select the ideal Figma design system , as we have an endless supply of inventive kits and systems at our disposal. After all, each designer has distinct skills and is at a different stage of their journey! UI Figma Design System and online Figma courses are always ready for you if you want to advance your abilities a bit further. The sheer number of distinctive kits and design systems available attests to the greatness of Figma and its user base. What’s not to love about this passionate worldwide community that collaborates to produce tools that make design better for everyone?

The mechanic enables users to enhance affixes attached to Legendary and Unique items up to 12 times. After leveling through all 12 ranks, an item should receive a 45 percent increase across its base affixes. While the feature proved a welcome addition, the Diablo community quickly uncovered a few flaws. For one, the . Blizzard rolled out a hotfix that reduced the cost, but the system still required some more fine-tuning. Diablo 4’s 1.4.1 to reduce cost of Masterworking As outlined in the patch notes, Diablo 4’s May 28 patch will address lingering Masterworking issues and much more. After the patch, players can expect Masterworking materials to be directly transmuted, for example. The Gold cost of Masterworking will also be decreased for Ranks 5 through 12.

        "content": "Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s government of Kano State has suspended Mustapha Indabawa, the Managing Director (MD) of Abubakar Rimi Television. The government has since appointed Hajiya Hauwa Ibrahim as the acting Managing Director of the television station. Naija News understands that the official letter of appointment for Ibrahim, dated 27 May 2024, was signed by Abdullahi Baffa Bichi, the secretary to the state government. The letter instructs Ibrahim to assume her new role immediately. Prior to this appointment, Ibrahim served as the deputy managing director of the television station. It is worth noting that the Kano State Government has filed seven charges, including criminal conspiracy, misappropriation, and diversion of funds, against the suspended MD and Staff Officer, Ibrahim M. Bello. These charges were brought forth following an investigation by the state anti-corruption commission, which was initiated after a petition was submitted to the state governor regarding the embattled MD. Reinstatement Of Emir Sanusi Done In Best Interest Of The State – Kano Govt Meanwhile, the Kano State Government, on Monday, said the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano was done in the best interest of the state. Recall that Governor Abba Yusuf recently deposed the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero and four emirs amd reinstated Muhammadu Sanusi 11 as the new Emir of a re-united single Kano Emirate. In a statement on Monday, the Commissioner of Information, Baba Halilu Dantiye, said the decision to reinstate Sanusi as the Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. Dantiye added that the reinstatement has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace, who understand and cherish the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure. He said: “It also behoves to reiterate that the decision by the administration of Abba Kabir Yusuf to legally abrogate the emirates and reinstate the 14th Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. The move has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace who understands and cherishes the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure.” Dantiye also urged the general public to disregard the sensational and grossly exaggerated media reports and support the efforts of the government to create a more cohesive and unified state. He also called on the media to exercise responsible journalism and verify facts before publishing any report that has the potential to cause unnecessary tension. “Kano State government under the leadership of Abba Kabir Yusuf remains committed to the progress and development of the state and call on all citizens to join hands in this regard,” he added.",

The defender has been on the treatment table since suffering his latest injury setback against Luton in February. Earlier in the season Shaw had missed several weeks of action because of a muscle injury, and he made just 12 Premier League appearances this season. He has still been called up to England's preliminary Euro 2024 squad, but had to watch United's FA Cup success from the Wembley stands. Shaw revealed his loyalty to his club has been questioned over the last few weeks as he provided an update on his wellbeing. He wrote in a statement on Instagram: \"Happy for the boys to lift the trophy at the weekend and finish this season on a positive. As much as it was the result I wanted it was hard to watch from the stands. \"This has definitely been the most frustrating season for me, I have had set back after set back and have worked so hard to get back to fitness but things just haven’t gone my way. I pushed so hard to get back before the end of the season and the final but some things just aren’t meant to be. \"There’s nothing I want to do more than play and win with Manchester United. \"I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. \"The reality is I am not 100 per cent fit for either right now but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.

        "content": "LUKE SHAW has offered fans an injury update and hit out at those who have questioned his loyalty to Manchester United. The defender has been on the treatment table since suffering his latest injury setback against Luton in February. Earlier in the season Shaw had missed several weeks of action because of a muscle injury, and he made just 12 Premier League appearances this season. He has still been called up to England's preliminary Euro 2024 squad, but had to watch United's FA Cup success from the Wembley stands. Shaw revealed his loyalty to his club has been questioned over the last few weeks as he provided an update on his wellbeing. He wrote in a statement on Instagram: \"Happy for the boys to lift the trophy at the weekend and finish this season on a positive. As much as it was the result I wanted it was hard to watch from the stands. \"This has definitely been the most frustrating season for me, I have had set back after set back and have worked so hard to get back to fitness but things just haven’t gone my way. I pushed so hard to get back before the end of the season and the final but some things just aren’t meant to be. \"There’s nothing I want to do more than play and win with Manchester United. \"I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. \"The reality is I am not 100 per cent fit for either right now but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS \"I appreciate I haven’t updated you all with my injuries and where I’m at with my recovery but equally the most important thing to me is that we’re supporting the team playing. My biggest focus right now is being fit and then whatever happens this summer I will be ready. Thank you for your patience ❤️\" United captain Bruno Fernandes shared support for his team-mate, commenting: \"Shawberto will be back.\"",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

Tanko further said that the government could use constructive criticism from the opposition to make the country work. “I do not know why they are not taking even the free consultancy that he has been giving, you do not need to be close to somebody before he can be working with you, we have been criticising very important issues that affect every Nigerian in this country on a constant basis,” Tanko said. 2027 Presidency: Many Political Parties, Politicians Want To Work With Peter Obi – Aide Reveals Peter Obi’s media spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, has revealed that many politicians and political parties are interested in working with his principal, Peter Obi, ahead of the 2027 presidential election.

        "content": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. — On the last Monday in May each year, people around America take the day to honor and mourn the many men and women who died while serving and protecting their country and the freedoms of the people who live there. In Saratoga Springs, members of the community gathered in Congress Park at the War Memorial where Gurtler Brothers VFW Post 420 hosted a commemoration ceremony in honor of the holiday. According to Gene Ratigliano, Post Quartermaster and Past Post and State Commander, this ceremony has been something that has been put on for many years and used to coincide with the Saratoga Springs Memorial Day Parade, which the city has not had for the last couple of years. He believes ceremonies like this one are important, not just because of the significant meaning behind them but because it stands as a reminder of how important it is to remember what these fallen soldiers did for their country. “We need to remember our past, we need to remember our history – if we don’t remember what we’ve done in the past, we’re bound to fail again in the future,” Ratigliano said. “It’s only common sense, and I think it means a lot – it means that people really understand and appreciate what they (the soldiers) did for them.” “The culture we have today is a little bit different than in the past. There are many things going on today that I think previous generations probably would not have put up with. This remembrance brings us back to reality.” The ceremony included a reading of Logan’s Order, which called for a National Day of Remembrance for those who died in the Civil War and was the basis for Memorial Day, as well as a singing of the National Anthem, a rifle salute, taps and a speech from Saratoga Springs Mayor John Safford. Safford shared that participating in these kinds of ceremonies gives him an opportunity as mayor to put emphasis on service and what that means to him as well as other veterans in the community who watched friends die while in the armed forces. During his speech, Safford recognized some of the individuals he knew who died in combat and talked about the respect and honor owed to those who died in uniform. “If there is any of us here that knows what it feels like to lose your friends at 20 years old, to know they died for you in your place, then you know something about what we are doing today,” Safford said in his speech. Safford also pointed out the commemorative bricks along the Veteran’s Walk of Honor, which includes more than 2,000 bricks engraved with the names of local war veterans to memorialize them in front of the War Memorial in Congress Park. Safford explained that many of these individuals were 20 or 21 years old when they died – and their service must be remembered. “They (the soldiers) died for me and for you, the city and this country,” Safford said. “We never should forget that. Never ever. I can tell you that I will never forget that.” Ratigliano shared that he and Safford have been talking and are starting plans to bring the Memorial Day Parade back next year so more people can celebrate the service and the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to ensure the freedoms of Saratogians and Americans in general. In Ratigliano’s eyes, bringing this parade back allows more people to understand and realize what this day really means and what it is honoring.

During his speech, Safford recognized some of the individuals he knew who died in combat and talked about the respect and honor owed to those who died in uniform. “If there is any of us here that knows what it feels like to lose your friends at 20 years old, to know they died for you in your place, then you know something about what we are doing today,” Safford said in his speech. Safford also pointed out the commemorative bricks along the Veteran’s Walk of Honor, which includes more than 2,000 bricks engraved with the names of local war veterans to memorialize them in front of the War Memorial in Congress Park. Safford explained that many of these individuals were 20 or 21 years old when they died – and their service must be remembered. “They (the soldiers) died for me and for you, the city and this country,” Safford said. “We never should forget that. Never ever. I can tell you that I will never forget that.” Ratigliano shared that he and Safford have been talking and are starting plans to bring the Memorial Day Parade back next year so more people can celebrate the service and the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to ensure the freedoms of Saratogians and Americans in general. In Ratigliano’s eyes, bringing this parade back allows more people to understand and realize what this day really means and what it is honoring.

        "content": "K-pop’s first appearance on the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart was in 2009, when the Wonder Girls’ “Nobody” hit No. 76. Fifty years earlier, in 1959 The Kim Sisters (Sue, Aija, and Mia) from Korea made their American TV premiere on The Ed Sullivan show. So, is 1959 the year that K-Pop made its debut in the US? Probably not, but we should celebrate the importance of The Kim Sisters in representing Korea to the US. They would eventually appear on The Ed Sullivan Show twenty-one times, more than any other act. They performed covers of popular American songs, such as “Charlie Brown” (originally by The Coasters), “Try to Remember” (original song from the musical “The Fantasticks”) and “When the Saints Go Marching In” (traditional Christian hymn covered by Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Elvis, Judy Garland and many others). They sang songs familiar to mainstream American audiences. On one occasion, they performed “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore” and they were joined by their mother who added the occasional “Arirang” lyric, a nod to the traditional Korean song. These young women were remarkable not only because they could sing and dance as well as any of the girl groups popular in the US at the time, but they were also multi-instrumentalists. YouTube clips feature the members playing drums, saxophones, guitars, etc., in their performances. Sue (Kim Sook-ja) and Aija (Kim Ai-ja) were biological sisters. Mia (Kim Min-ja) was Sue and Aija’s cousin who was later adopted by Sue and Aija’s mother, singer Lee Nan-yang. Lee was famous for her 1935 song “Tears of Mokpo.” After the kidnapping and murder of her husband, conductor Kim Hae-song, she had to support herself and her children by entertaining American GIs. She later taught her children how to sing American songs and play musical instruments. Eventually, The Kim Sisters were formed and sent to Las Vegas with their manager, Bob McMackin. Their initial 4 week stint in 1959 at The Thunderbird in Las Vegas led to an additional 35 years in residency in Las Vegas venues including The Stardust, Las Vegas Hilton and the Holiday Casino. I think they deserve a place alongside other Asian American entertainers, perhaps more so than next to K-pop acts. What cemented this position for me was when I discovered their medley of songs from the film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical “Flower Drum Song” (1961). This film is based on a Broadway musical inspired by Chin Yang Lee’s novel of the same title. The story is about Chinese American families in San Francisco, whose parents and children straddle stereotypically traditional Chinese versus American values. It includes Chinese characters who are born in the US and others that are recent arrivals to America. It became the first Hollywood film to feature a majority Asian American cast (and there would not be another one for another 30 years, until “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993). The film was nominated for numerous Academy Awards. The lead actors for the film included Nancy Kwan (biracial Chinese/white American), James Shigeta (Japanese American), Miyoshi Umeki (Japanese American), Jack Soo (Japanese American), Benson Fong (Chinese American), and Juanita Hall (biracial black/white American). Miyoshi Umeki is also the first Asian American actress to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (for “Sayonara.”) These were many of the most well-known Asian American (and Black) actors of the time, but most were not Chinese or Chinese American. Among Asian American fans and scholars, views of “Flower Drum Song” have swung from positive to negative and back again. However, there is no debate about its iconic status for Asian Americans in the history of Hollywood films. As a Chinese American who grew up in San Francisco, I remember seeing this film as a child. I’ve seen it many times since. While songs like “Chop Suey” are a little “cringey,” seeing Asian American actors tell a story about the diversity of Chinese Americans in San Francisco left a deep impression on me. I’ve appreciated the importance of this film, even before I became an academic. The stereotypes of “traditional Chinese” versus “modern American” values is arguably a retrograde representation of the immigrant experience, but the film avoids using white actors in yellowface. There are no white actors with their eyes taped so they might appear “oriental” as was standard practice in Hollywood. Some might complain that not all of the actors were Chinese or Chinese American, but given the period during which this film was produced, the cast is a great leap forward. Despite being born in Korea, The Kim Sisters’ professional careers were built on their performances of American songs arranged to appeal to Americans, from GIs in Korea, to American TV and Las Vegas audiences. Their first job was performing as a part of the “China Doll Revue,” which included Chinese and Japanese American entertainers. They lived most of their lives in the US as Americans. Like the other Asian American actors in “Flower Drum Song,” they were constrained by how white Americans viewed Asian Americans. They could convincingly sing about a Chinese American family not only because they were seen as Korean, but also as Asian American.

        "content": "Article content Opposition New Democrats say the Alberta government is being anti-democratic by invoking time allocation measures that limit debate around some of its most controversial bills ahead of the end of the legislative session later this week. Last week, government house leader Joseph Schow introduced motions to limit debate on four separate bills, including Bill 20, which the government introduced amendments to last week following widespread backlash . The motions limit the time allotted for debate to one hour for each stage of each bill. “Be it resolved that when further consideration of Bill 20, Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment Act, 2024, is resumed, not more than one hour shall be allotted to any further consideration of the bill in second reading, at which time every question necessary for the disposal of the bill at this stage shall be put forthwith,” states one such motion that was tabled last Tuesday. Schow defended the use of time allocation, saying it is needed to get through the government’s agenda. “There’s a difference between productive debate and just extended debate. I think we’ve reached a point where we may be past productive debate,” he said, accusing the Opposition NDP of being “obstructionist.” “I think robust discussion is ongoing in that chamber. But I also recognize and believe that ... if the Opposition is not interested in bringing forth new ideas, then we’re going to move forward in time allocation so that we can get through the legislative agenda.” He added the government also had invoked a motion to hold evening sittings from Monday through Wednesday, starting Monday night, in an effort to get through the bills. “We have a mandate from Albertans that was given to us in the last election,” he said, adding “we have a job to do.” “We’re going to use the tools at our disposal to get out at a reasonable time.” Opposition house leader Christina Gray said the government is on pace to use time allocation 50 times compared to her party who used it on four occasions when it was in power. “It’s incredibly frustrating and shameful that the government continues to eliminate time for debate on legislation that Albertans deeply care about,” she said. “It’s really a continuation of the pattern we’ve seen from this government and it’s doing a huge disservice to Albertans as well as being not what this government ran on.” She denied her party was being obstructionist and accused the government of ramming through its agenda. “This government feels entitled to pass any legislation that they feel they can without consulting with Albertans.” As of the start of Monday’s afternoon sitting, the bills impacted are: The current spring sitting of the legislature is scheduled to end late Thursday afternoon, although it may also wrap up ahead of then. — with files from Cindy Tran mblack@postmedia.com",

        "content": "Kendall Waston se sinceró, se desahogó, tras lograr el campeonato con el Deportivo Saprissa. Terminó el partido contra Alajuelense y se fue a saludar a su esposa y a su hijo, únicos testigos del sufrimiento de Kendall durante varios meses, pues padeció una pubalgia en diciembre del año pasado y estuvo cinco meses sin actuar, pero antes de reaparecer en los terrenos de juego, el defensa vivió un martirio: llegó a deprimirse y llorar de impotencia. “Lloré muchísimas veces, lloré a escondidas de mi esposa para que no me viera con dolor, porque uno, como cabeza de hogar, quiere estar fuerte. Tuve que abrirme a ella, serle sincero y decirle por lo que pasaba”, dijo Kendall. Waston nunca había estado tanto tiempo sin jugar, por eso calificó el Clausura 2024 como el torneo más difícil por la lesión y todo lo que vivió. “Sufrí bastante, pero también así es como se disfruta más. Me pasó por la mente si no volvería a jugar, si me tendría que retirar. Hubo momentos donde no me podía levantar de la cama, fue muy complicado, casi que me arrastraba para poder moverme y gracias a Dios con la ayuda de él salí adelante”, recordó Kendall. Waston manifestó que su esposa fue su gran soporte; ella le hizo ver que debía luchar, que no podía terminar ahí sin volver a una cancha de fútbol. Al zaguero lo atormentaba enfrentar una lesión que no sabía cuánto tiempo lo iba a dejar fuera. ''10 años atrás pude ser partícipe de lograr la 30, siempre ganar títulos es lindísimo'', Kendall Waston Pero esperó, fue paciente y el cinco de este mes volvió a sentirse futbolista. Ese día, Saprissa visitó a Puntarenas, Kendall ingresó en los últimos minutos, lo hizo como delantero y anotó. “Creo que el más sorprendido por esa anotación fui yo, pero bendito Dios que me dio el privilegio de jugar y anotar. Yo siempre oraba y le decía, si usted me tiene aquí por algo es y solo quiero cumplir su voluntad”, destacó Kendall Waston. Cuando a Kendall se le consultó cuánto le sabía el título 40, lo pensó poco, mostró su gran sonrisa y soltó la respuesta. “Me sabe riquísimo, riquisísimo”, dijo Kendall, al tiempo que soltó una carcajada. (Mayela López) Waston estaba seguro de que le iban a dar vuelta a la serie contra Alajuelense y ganar la final. Señaló que en el grupo había mucha convicción y se inyectaron de motivación por el recibimiento de la afición al llegar al estadio morado. “Yo sabía que cuando cayera el primer gol, iban a llegar los demás. Ver el estadio vibrar no es fácil de llevar y le sacamos ventaja a la localía”, dijo Waston. Un tema que no se podía dejar de lado es la Selección y Kendall reiteró que quiere estar en el grupo que dirige Gustavo Alfaro. “Yo lo dije en su momento, no le voy a cerrar nunca las puertas a la Selección, mientras esté jugando, soy un soldado más. Si me llaman, voy; si no, voy a darlo todo para estar disponible”, comentó Kendall Waston.",

Detective Superintendent Steven Elliot, of Police Scotland’s Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit, previously said: “I’d like to thank the community for their continued support and information which helps us remove illegal, harmful substances from our streets.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "THE MUMBAI police SIT probing the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse case summoned Assistant Commissioner of Police with the Government Railway Police (GRP) S Nikam to appear before them on Tuesday to record his statement and provide some documents. The ACP’s name featured on some of the documents related to granting permissions for the hoarding following which he has been called to record his statement. An officer said that as part of their probe, they have found that the land on which the hoarding was erected did not belong to railways and ideally should have had permission from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Advertisement The police will also be writing to the BMC seeking to find out how an illegal hoarding could come up in their jurisdiction without them taking any action. As many as 17 people were killed when a hoarding collapsed on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13. The SIT has arrested owner of the hoarding Bhavesh Bhinde, who is in their custody till Wednesday.",

In a country obsessed with fair skin (slang — gori chamdi) and ‘foreign figures’ (slang — videshi maal) an (un)healthy trend has crept into the power corridors of the rich and famous. Many private yacht soirees, high-end clubs, car show events, realty project launches, foo-foo fine dining restaurants, and the whole wedding shebang are hiring foreigners from the UK, France, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Central Asia as ‘white eye candy’ ushers, entertainers, human tables, bartenders, and dancers. The unhealthy gaze of some uncouth wealthy desi men can be repulsive but the money is good and hard cash. Many event managers opine that white-skinned men and women raise the ‘oomph factor’. While the quick dough generated through wine and cheese tasting ‘human table’ or gyrating on desi songs is prevalent, the underlying reality highlights the need to sustain oneself in a low-paying industry.",

        "content": "What advice does an Olympian have for those starting out running? David Gillick raced for Ireland in the 2008 Olympics and currently holds the indoor and outdoor Irish 400m records. Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , Mr Gillick said it was important to remember to stretch as “you’re asking an awful lot from your body”. “If you could add in simple things like squats, lunges, press ups,” he said. “Things like that that can just kind [of] help the body adapt to what you’re asking them to do. “It’s going to take a pounding along the pavement, so you need to have a robust body that can take that extra work and that extra load.” Mr Gillick said forming good habits early on will pay off if you are serious about running. “If you are at the early stages, building in some basic exercises can really help you in the long-term,” he said. “Whether you’re elite or whether you’re a more seasoned runner, essence is key and even in the elite athletes are doing that probably as many times as they’re running... So, if you’re starting out, do try and build in some form of strength and conditioning or even resistance work.” As with many things, it pays to ramp things up slowly and Mr Gillick suggested increasing the mileage you run each time in a gradual manner. “People will look towards the end of the year and think, ‘Oh, it’s October’ for say the Dublin Marathon,” he said. “Start now and build it up; so again, you could be going for your 90 minute runs and then build it to 1.40 hours, 1.45 hours. “Don’t make any massive jumps because that will inflict a lot of issues in terms of physical impact.” You can listen back here: Main image: Ireland's David Gillick performs on men's 400 meters final during the European athletics indoor championships in Birmingham, UK on March 3, 2007.

        "content": "LESS than a week on since Rishi Sunak’s unimpressive announcement in Downing Street about the election on July 4, where are we? Well, for most people life has gone on entirely as normal. That, for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, is a problem. As it happens, life was continuing for me in a very normal way. My wife’s niece, Juliet, was getting married in the North East of England and I was under strict instructions that the weekend was not to be filled with “politics”. Instead, a celebration of people coming together, building a life together and putting politics into perspective. For those of us who have been steeped in politics for years — in my case, 60 years this year as a member of the Labour Party — we often forget that people “have a life” which does not involve listening to politicians or getting deeply engaged with political arguments. If Labour is to win an overall majority, and this is by no means certain, reaching those people who are not “switched on” and, therefore, connected and engaged with the political debate will be critical. ­Surely the lesson, so far, is don’t attack your political opponent on issues and in a manner which is frankly unbelievable. This was the lesson of the 1997 election, when the Conservatives portrayed Tony Blair , with “demon eyes”, as some sort of threat. The visual images were such that people ridiculed what they knew to be entirely untrue. In this election it is the notion that the nation’s security is somehow at risk from a Starmer government. Given that Sir Keir has been absolutely, 100 per cent behind Government policy in terms of committing to and supporting Ukraine , and that all the crazy notions of Jeremy Corbyn five years ago are now for the birds, this line of attack is doomed from the start. Not least because the Prime Minister’s commitment to raising defence spending is not for the next Parliament , but for the one after — in 2030! In what is undoubtedly going to be a brutal few weeks, unlikely to do great credit to sensible and balanced dialogue or to trust and engagement with politics, there are issues which will be, in my terms, “toxic”. Immigration is clearly one such issue. As a home secretary, over 20 years ago, who reached an agreement with the French which cut those coming across from Calais by two-thirds, I’m painfully aware of the practical and political challenges that exist. However, Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a General Election unexpectedly in the summer has denied the Conservatives the right to claim that their so-called “Rwanda policy” is working. On the other hand, it has avoided the total embarrass- ment of calmer seas resulting in literally tens of thousands of people crossing the Channel despite the threat of being transported to East Africa . I wouldn’t say that there is “method in Rishi Sunak’s madness” because failure to give your own policy a chance to work isn’t a great offer to the electorate. But the more profound issue is the countless numbers of people who have been labelled by recent legislation as “illegal” and are completely stuck in the system. These are people who came across the Channel without documentation and can’t claim asylum . They are not being processed, not going anywhere and costing us a fortune. Here’s a thought. Why would anyone, after the last turbulent and, some would say (including me), disastrous 14 years, vote Conservative? I will, during the General Election, come back to this theme, but suffice it to say that, despite my tribal ideology and commitment to the Labour Party, I am not yet convinced that Labour will win by an avalanche. Pollsters and pundits all think it is a foregone conclusion. I’m not so sure. Labour enter this election with only 205 MPs thanks to the antics of Jeremy Corbyn and the far Left. There needs to be the most enormous swing of more than 12 per cent to get an overall majority, and this involves overturning Conservative seats where, in 2019, they won by 15,000 to 16,000 votes! It is a mountain to climb. So, although I wish, profoundly, that I am wrong, I predict, at this stage of the General Election, that a good result for Labour would be an overall majority of 20. I don’t believe the Conservatives can win, but I think it is by no means certain that Labour are yet home and dry. Complacency is always the killer.",

        "content": "LESS than a week on since Rishi Sunak’s unimpressive announcement in Downing Street about the election on July 4, where are we? Well, for most people life has gone on entirely as normal. That, for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, is a problem. As it happens, life was continuing for me in a very normal way. My wife’s niece, Juliet, was getting married in the North East of England and I was under strict instructions that the weekend was not to be filled with “politics”. Instead, a celebration of people coming together, building a life together and putting politics into perspective. For those of us who have been steeped in politics for years — in my case, 60 years this year as a member of the Labour Party — we often forget that people “have a life” which does not involve listening to politicians or getting deeply engaged with political arguments. If Labour is to win an overall majority, and this is by no means certain, reaching those people who are not “switched on” and, therefore, connected and engaged with the political debate will be critical. ­Surely the lesson, so far, is don’t attack your political opponent on issues and in a manner which is frankly unbelievable. This was the lesson of the 1997 election, when the Conservatives portrayed Tony Blair , with “demon eyes”, as some sort of threat. The visual images were such that people ridiculed what they knew to be entirely untrue. In this election it is the notion that the nation’s security is somehow at risk from a Starmer government. Given that Sir Keir has been absolutely, 100 per cent behind Government policy in terms of committing to and supporting Ukraine , and that all the crazy notions of Jeremy Corbyn five years ago are now for the birds, this line of attack is doomed from the start. Not least because the Prime Minister’s commitment to raising defence spending is not for the next Parliament , but for the one after — in 2030! In what is undoubtedly going to be a brutal few weeks, unlikely to do great credit to sensible and balanced dialogue or to trust and engagement with politics, there are issues which will be, in my terms, “toxic”. Immigration is clearly one such issue. As a home secretary, over 20 years ago, who reached an agreement with the French which cut those coming across from Calais by two-thirds, I’m painfully aware of the practical and political challenges that exist. However, Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a General Election unexpectedly in the summer has denied the Conservatives the right to claim that their so-called “Rwanda policy” is working. On the other hand, it has avoided the total embarrass- ment of calmer seas resulting in literally tens of thousands of people crossing the Channel despite the threat of being transported to East Africa . I wouldn’t say that there is “method in Rishi Sunak’s madness” because failure to give your own policy a chance to work isn’t a great offer to the electorate. But the more profound issue is the countless numbers of people who have been labelled by recent legislation as “illegal” and are completely stuck in the system. These are people who came across the Channel without documentation and can’t claim asylum. They are not being processed, not going anywhere and costing us a fortune. Here’s a thought. Why would anyone, after the last turbulent and, some would say (including me), disastrous 14 years, vote Conservative? I will, during the General Election, come back to this theme, but suffice it to say that, despite my tribal ideology and commitment to the Labour Party, I am not yet convinced that Labour will win by an avalanche. Pollsters and pundits all think it is a foregone conclusion. I’m not so sure. Labour enter this election with only 205 MPs thanks to the antics of Jeremy Corbyn and the far Left. There needs to be the most enormous swing of more than 12 per cent to get an overall majority, and this involves overturning Conservative seats where, in 2019, they won by 15,000 to 16,000 votes! It is a mountain to climb. So, although I wish, profoundly, that I am wrong, I predict, at this stage of the General Election, that a good result for Labour would be an overall majority of 20. I don’t believe the Conservatives can win, but I think it is by no means certain that Labour are yet home and dry. Complacency is always the killer.",

In an announcement last night, the Albanese government said emergency relief supplies, such as shelter, hygiene kits and specific support for women and children would be provided. Australia would also send technical experts to offer incident management assistance, support geohazard assessments and to help with early recovery efforts. Yesterday, Papua New Guinea’s national disaster centre asked the United Nations for international assistance , reportedly saying the landslide in the country’s remote north could have buried more than 2,000 people. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles , said Australians will be thinking of PNG at this very difficult time. He said: As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support. Australia’s defence force is working closely with the PNG Defence Force to assist with the response. This work is yet another demonstration of the close partnership between our nations and militaries.

As the federal parliament returns for two weeks, our environment editor Adam Morton bemoans the lack of clear policies to tackle the climate crisis and issues an impassioned plea for a change. On the one hand the government appears confused and wedged by the gas industry – especially in Western Australia where Labor is in power and can’t turn against such a powerful lobby. And on the other hand, Coalition hasn’t even got a policy. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5m in initial aid to Papua New Guinea as the death toll continues to rise after a catastrophic landslide that destroyed a village . PNG’s disaster centre said more than 2,000 people had been buried alive by Friday’s landslide in remote Enga province.

        "description": "Leeds United’s nightmare relationship with the play-offs continued when they were beaten by Southampton in the Championship play-off final on Sunday at Wembley. Thousands upon...The post Troy Deeney blasts actions of ‘four or five’ Leeds players on Wembley pitch after play-off final appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "Thousands upon thousands of Leeds fans descended to the capital hoping for history to be wiped out and not repeat itself. But it wasn’t meant to be for Daniel Farke and his players because, for the fourth time in their history, were beaten in a play-off final at Wembley or The Millennium Stadium. For a lot of fans, it was hard to take, not just because they were beaten in another or they were going to spend another season in England’s second tier. But because the majority of their players, , didn’t turn up and that’s what will hurt more. When the final whistle blew, you could understand the elation and joy in the eyes of the Southampton players because they celebrated like every team would do in their situation, But many of the Leeds players had their heads down and looked utterly distraught because a 49-game season has now ended with virtually nothing. Troy Deeney was pitchside at Wembley and he simply didn’t like what he saw from some of the Leeds players after the full-time whistle. The former striker, who has won promotion to the Premier League with Watford, slammed ‘four or five players’ for ‘laughing and joking’ when the game had finished, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:50 pm). Deeney wasn’t shy to point out his own troubles at the home of football and losing 6-0 to Manchester City in an FA Cup final, so he is someone who can speak from experience. Leeds United players at Wembley “When I look at Leeds, the last month flattered to deceive where you want your big players, your leaders to step up and they went missing,” said Deeney. “I am not going to name names, but you are standing and you can see how people react after. I have lost here (at Wembley) 6-0 to Manchester City. That was a drubbing. You have got to stand there, in a line, clap your opponents, well done and the better team won. Show a bit of humility and respect. “Four or five of them over the other side laughing and joking.” Recovering from another play-off final defeat Under Marcelo Bielsa, Leeds also lost a play-off – semi-final against Derby County – before going on to win the title the following season. When Farke won promotion with Norwich, he did so in his second season. Many would point towards that as a good omen for the club, but you feel these are different circumstances. In comparison to those teams, there is probably going to be more of a clearout this summer, with big players leaving and it will make Farke’s life more difficult. That’s why it’s paramount the club keep him at the club because it wouldn’t be a surprise if, , more than a few players departed.",

        "description": "Everyone loves food, and you can learn more about traditions surrounding our food and meals at the DeKalb History Center in Sycamore.",
        "content": "We all love food, and the DeKalb County History Center presents a new exhibition about the history and traditions surrounding our food and meals. “Food: Gathering Around the Table” will open with a grand reception from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, June 1, at the , 1730 N. Main St., Sycamore. According to the DeKalb County History Center, the exhibit will explore natural resources, local food traditions, food technology and food as an autobiography. Because food traditions are diverse and evolving, the intersection of American culture is an important factor in American food, the history’s website states. Michelle Donahoe, executive director of the DeKalb County History Center, said she and her team have been working for more than a year to research, identify photos and objects, and conduct interviews with residents for the exhibit. There are five main sections to the exhibit. The first is “Land of Plenty,” which focuses on Native American food traditions, hunting and gathering, local farming and food insecurity; “Local in Locale” presents stories about area restaurants, festivals and more; “Dynamic Delivery” shares information about food and its relationship to technology and local businesses; “Home Cooking” showcases historical cookbooks, old kitchen utensils and fine china that was used for special occasions. The fifth section is a hands-on activity area for kids. “The display really has something for everyone – young, old, current residents and those from out of town,” Donahoe said. “I think it really shows how food brings us together. Food has unrivaled power to connect people with place, to create an identity for a community or region, and to plant an enduring memory for people passing through.” The history center collaborated on the exhibit with the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution’s Museum on Main Street program, which helped provide the framework. Donahoe and her staff worked to find the local stories to complement those themes. “‘Food’ was a national competition directed by the Smithsonian’s Museum on Main Street team in Washington, D.C., and we were very honored to be selected,” she said. “Their input on the exhibit, programs and outreach has made this one of the most engaging displays ever.” Donahoe understands that not everyone is interested in local history, but said that everyone loves food, and the exhibit will appeal to folks from all over the area, not just DeKalb County residents. “Food can be an adventure when you try something new, it can be comforting when you enjoy a traditional favorite, it can energize when [you] eat something you have grown, and it can be a way to rally our community to bring support to that special cause,” she said. “In other words, this exhibit is about history, but it presents it in a fun and creative way. There is really something for everyone.” The exhibit will run for about two years, Donahoe said. The history center also received a grant from Illinois Humanities to host a podcast about food, and more details are expected to be released in coming months, she said. For more details, visit .",

        "content": "From crowdfunding to the use of recycled paper and clothes – the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has said that its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Surat next month is set to be a sustainable event. The event is scheduled to be held between June 7 and June 9. Over 1,500 used denim trousers were collected from college students under a campaign that went on for a week. These will be refurbished as bags to be used during the event, said organisers. “We visited over 80 college and university campuses to collect used denims from students between May 7 and May 14. These have been handed over to Mahil Gruh Udhyog (women self help groups) to make shoulder bags that will be distributed among participants during the NEC meet,” ABVP Gujarat secretary Samarth Bhatt told The Indian Express . Advertisement The NEC meeting to be held in Parvat Patiya area of Surat is expected to witness a participation of nearly 500 student representatives from across the country. The student body, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), also opted for crowdfunding to finance the event. Around Rs 5 lakh has been collected from textile and diamond markets of Surat by a team of ABVP members. “Five teams of ten each collected funds from textile and diamond merchants in Surat. This exercise was conducted to ensure social or community participation in the national event and also to reflect that the funds thus collected are used responsibly,” Samarth Bhatt added. To go paperless, the ABVP has launched a mobile app — especially for the meeting — where resolutions will be uploaded. Suggestions will also be sought on the app. Moreover, organisers also say they prefer the use of recycled paper throughout the event. The diaries to be used are made from recycled paper collected from students. Along with being a plastic-free event, the banners will be made of cloth, ABVP state media convenor Meet Bhavsar said. On June 6, a felicitation event will be followed by a cultural event. The NEC event is to be inaugurated on June 7 where ABVP representatives will deliberate on social, education and organisational issues, say organisers.",

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" People are also reading... Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. Photos: Remembering Lisa Marie Presley, 1968-2023 \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "description": "Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces",
        "content": "It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. “ When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Manitoba . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.”",

        "description": "Despite its recent sharp gains, Enbridge (TSX:ENB) stock has the potential to continue inching up in the years to come and reward investors with higher dividends.The post Where Will Enbridge Stock Be in 3 Years? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "After declining by nearly 10% in 2023, ( ) stock seems to be regaining strength in recent months. ENB stock has gone up by more than 12% over the last seven months to currently trade at $49.53 per share with a of $104.8 billion. At this market price, it offers an impressive 7.4% annualized dividend yield and distributes these dividend payouts every quarter. But can Enbridge continue to deliver strong returns to investors in the years ahead? Before discussing where the stock might stand three years from now by looking at the factors that are likely to influence Enbridge’s future performance, let’s first review the drivers of its recent recovery. Key factors helping Enbridge stock recover The main reason for Enbridge stock’s recent recovery could be the resilience of its core business, which consists of transporting and storing crude oil and natural gas across North America. Despite the challenges posed by warmer weather and largely weaker commodity prices in recent quarters, the company is continuing to maintain positive earnings growth, robust cash flows, and dividends. In the first quarter of 2024, Enbridge’s total revenue 8.6% YoY (year over year) to around $11 billion as significantly warmer weather affected the performance of its gas distribution and storage segment. Nevertheless, despite this negative factor, along with higher operating costs, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings jumped by 8.2% YoY to $0.92 per share, beating Street analysts’ expectations of $0.81 per share. Similarly, its adjusted net profit margin expanded to 17.7% in the latest quarter from 14.3% a year ago. These positive factors might have supported a recovery in Enbridge’s stock price in recent months, as investors might have appreciated its strong earnings potential despite unfavourable market conditions. Where will Enbridge stock be in three years? Besides continued strength in its core energy transportation business, Enbridge, in recent years, has increased its focus on further diversifying its revenue stream. This is one of the key reasons why the company is investing in segments like crude oil export and renewable energy. Also, its strong cash flows and robust financial position give it the ability to invest in future growth. For example, in the first quarter, Enbridge completed the acquisition of The East Ohio Gas Company (known as Enbridge Gas Ohio now) in a deal worth US$6.6 billion, which is expected to improve its position in the gas distribution market and help it accelerate financial growth trends. While it’s nearly impossible for anyone to accurately predict where Enbridge stock will be three years from now, its strong and diverse revenue streams indicate that it has a bright future ahead, which can help its share prices continue soaring in the coming years. That said, if you expect to multiply your invested money in a short period of time, ENB stock might not be the best option for you. However, if you are looking for a long-term investment that can provide you with a steady dividend income and capital appreciation, then you might want to consider adding Enbridge stock to your portfolio. Also, the fact that it has a solid track record of increasing its dividends for 29 consecutive years makes it even more appealing for long-term income investors.",

        "content": "Private daycares squeezed out by B.C. public programs Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces Xiao Xu, The Globe and Mail May 27, 2024 1:30 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. kali9/E+/Getty Images Listen to this article 00:09:54 It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. “ When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Manitoba . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.” See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "While have staged a remarkable comeback since the bear market of 2022, ( ) continues to trail the broader indices. Most equity indices, such as the S&P 500 and TSX 60, are trading near all-time highs, but LSPD stock is down 87% from record levels. Valued at a of US$2.32 billion, Lightspeed Commerce offers a fintech platform to small and medium enterprises, primarily in the restaurant industry. Lightspeed’s sales increased from US$221.7 million in fiscal 2021 (which ended in March) to US$909 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to acquisitions. The rapid expansion in the top line meant LSPD stock soared from $27 in May 2019 to over $160 in September 2021. However, a scathing report from Spruce Point, a noted short-seller, drove LSPD shares lower. In late September 2021, Spruce Point accused Lightspeed of inflating its total addressable market, customer counts, and gross transaction volume (GTV). Spruce Point claimed it found evidence that Lightspeed inflated its business pre-IPO (initial public offering) and overstated its customer count by 85% and GTV by 10%. The short-seller also stated, “We believe that Lightspeed’s recent acquisition spree has come at escalating costs with no clear path to profitability while management pursues aggressive revenue reporting practices.” Lightspeed Commerce is a beaten-down growth stock that is forecast to increase sales to US$1.1 billion in fiscal 2025 and to US$1.32 billion in 2026. An asset-light model should help Lightspeed improve profit margins significantly and benefit from operating leverage. The company is on track to improve earnings from US$0.16 per share in 2024 to US$0.34 per share in 2025 and US$0.53 per share in 2026. So, priced at 44.5 times , LSPD stock trades at a 20% discount to consensus price targets. However, I believe this is a much better buy at the current valuation. Let’s see why. While LSPD stock is down in the dumps, ( ) stock is up 283% in the last three years. Bombardier has increased its sales from $6 billion in 2021 to $8 billion in 2023. While it reported an operating loss of $269 million in 2021, it ended 2023 with an operating income of $8 billion. In the last two years, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) grew by a factor of more than four times to 15% in 2023. Its robust performance has put the company on track to end 2025 with sales of $9 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.625 billion, and free cash flow of $900 million. While Bombardier has $6 billion in debt, it aims to maintain a net leverage ratio of between 2 and 2.5 times. Moreover, a focus on cost optimization should help it end 2024 with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.72. Analysts expect EPS to surge by 58% to $9 per share in 2025, indicating the TSX stock is priced at less than 10 times forward earnings. Despite its sizeable returns since 2021, Bombardier stock should continue to outpace the broader markets, given its earnings forecasts.",

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

Haugen says the trials went great. “It was very interesting, very exciting and a good environment,” she says. “It was good to race at that level.” She qualified for the 100-metre breaststroke but admits it wasn’t her best time. She also did a couple of races in the 100-metre freestyle and was able to qualify for an Olympic trial time. “It was mostly a really nice visual of what my next four years (and) what I have to work up to. I didn’t place too well, which is fine, but it is more for the experience. Next year I plan on having at least five races at the trials and hopefully final in some of them (the junior finals).” She talked about using that as a platform to advance into the ‘B’ and ‘A’ finals. Richard Millns is the club’s head coach and is also Zac’s father. “As a head coach, I am very proud of all three of these swimmers. I have coached them since they were very little and am proud to see them bloom into the champions I always knew they could be,” says Millns. “As a father, I am so overjoyed to see my son compete at the Olympic Trials. He makes me a proud dad no matter what level he competes at, but it is nice to see him at the highest level.” Millns says the three teens finished in the middle of the pack. His 15-year-old son nearly qualified for the Junior Championship Final. To qualify for the trials, the swimmers needed to break club records and perform at “historically high levels” to represent the Campbell River community. The three teens are preparing to compete at the Far Western Championships in California (Owens and seven other CRKW members) and an international age-group competition in Spain (Millns and Haugen). “We’re going to race in Barcelona with a close friend who was a foreign exchange student a couple of years ago,” says Haugen. “It’s a real competition, it’s like a western-level meet, so that’s faster than Provincials, a little slower than trials.”",

        "content": "Finding high-growth investment opportunities in the middle of volatile markets is like finding gold. These days, three exceptional businesses have surfaced, all displaying eye-catching numbers and bright futures that attract the attention of astute investors throughout the globe. To begin with, the first one stands out due to its incredible financial boost. With an impressive yearly increase and quarterly boost in adjusted EBITDA, the business demonstrates solid cost control and operational efficiency. Moreover, the second one is very noticeable in the field of online shopping. The company’s marketplace shows a rising interaction and transactional value ecosystem, with a noteworthy growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) that third-party (3P) sellers mainly drive. This emerging market highlights the company’s flexibility and scalability in the digital sphere and offers steady development prospects. Finally, the third one stands out as a shining example of growth and financial stability. Supported by a solid increase in EPS and a discernible improvement in operating margins, the firm exhibits improved profitability and efficient cost control. Nextracker (NXT) The revenue of Nextracker (NASDAQ: NXT ) has uplifted massively on a quarterly and year-over-year (YoY) basis. The company’s sales for the fiscal 2024 were $2.5 billion , a solid boost of more than 30% YoY. The solid growth is further demonstrated by the Q4 revenue of $737 million, a 42% YoY increase. With that, Nextracker may continue to hit growth because of its steady revenue growth over the last quarter and fiscal year. This is the result of solid market demand and a progressive business strategy. Moreover, at $521 million, Nextracker’s adjusted EBITDA has more than doubled YoY—a remarkable 150% increase YoY. Adjusted EBITDA increased 120% YoY to $160 million in Q4 alone. Even without the IRA 45X tax credit benefits, this reflects excellent cost control and operational success. Additionally, Nextracker has had tremendous success abroad. Its Q4 income from overseas sales reached $242 million, an over 90% YoY increase. In addition, the business revealed a record backlog of over $4 billion , up more than 50% YoY and tripling over the preceding two years. Overall, based on completed contracts and purchase orders, this increasing backlog indicates solid future demand and improves revenue visibility, enabling long-term growth. GigaCloud (GCT) The GMV marketplace operated by GigaCloud (NASDAQ: GCT ) had a high 64% YoY boost , rising from $553.5 million to $908 million for the 12 months ended March 2024 (Q1 2024). This increase in GMV highlights the platform’s growing efficiency and scale for GigaCloud. Even more significantly, the GMV from third-party (3P) vendors increased, rising from $285 million to $490 million in the previous year’s period, a 71.8% increase. Moreover, the percentage of GMV attributed to 3P sellers has increased from 51.5% to 54%, indicating these sellers’ growing significance and input to GigaCloud’s marketplace. In short, the growth reflects an expanding marketplace ecosystem with increased engagement and transaction values. Additionally, sales increased 43.7% YoY from 602 to 865 active 3P vendors in Q1 2024. At the same time, there were 5,493 active purchasers , up from 4,255, a 29.1% YoY increase. Notably, the average spend per active buyer increased by 27%, from $130K to $165K. Therefore, these indicators suggest that the GigaCloud marketplace ecosystem is robust and expanding, with consumers and providers exhibiting increasing transaction values and increased involvement. Celestica (CLS) Celestica (NYSE: CLS ) derives a healthy profit as Q1 2024’s adjusted EPS increased to $0.86 from $0.47 in Q1 2023. This astounding 83% growth suggests increased profitability and efficient cost control. The non-IFRS operating margin for Celestica increased from 5.2% in Q1 2023 to 6.2% in Q1 2024. This 1% increase was fueled by an uplifted bottom line in the Advanced Technology Solutions ( ATS ) and Communications and Enterprise Solutions ( CCS ) divisions. This is the first time the quarterly non-IFRS operating margin has surpassed 6%. Additionally, revenue for the CCS segment increased from $1.04 billion to $1.44 billion , a 38% increase YoY. Currently, this market sector derives 65% of the company’s consolidated top-line. Moreover, the sector margin increased by 1.2%, from 5.8% to 7%. Notably, the solid demand from hyperscale clients, especially AI computing solutions, drives growth. Revenues for the ATS segment decreased by 3% YoY to $768 million, but the segment margin rose by 0.3% to 4.7% , demonstrating effective operations despite a challenging market. Finally, declines in industrial demand were countered by growth in the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector and a stable capital equipment business.

        "content": "The Strathcona Regional District is working on improving accessibility in the region, following rules set out by the province. The SRD announced the plan, which was approved in April, in recognition of National AccessAbility week (May 26 to June 2, 2024. The plan comes after the province enacted the Accessible BC act, mandating public organizations establish accessibility committees and develop accessibility plans. The act also directs governments to provide public feedback mechanisms to help identify and address barriers to accessibility. “In response, the SRD partnered with The City of Campbell River, the Village of Sayward, the Village of Zeballos, the Village of Tahsis, the Village of Gold River, Vancouver Island West School District 84, and the Vancouver Island Regional Library to establish the Strathcona Accessibility and Inclusion Advisory Committee (SAIAC), develop an Accessibility Plan and implement the feedback mechanism,” a release from the SRD says. The committee was established last year, and includes volunteer members from across the region. Those volunteer members provided feedback on the plan prior to its release. “The committee, representing a diverse range of voices is passionate about creating an inclusive region,” says Susan Sinnott, committee chair. “The approved accessibility plan marks the first step towards making our region and public institutions more inclusive for everyone.” “The partners of the Strathcona Regional Accessibility Plan and the SAIAC will prioritize the identified barriers, work to eliminate them, and report on the progress to do so,” the release says. “The Strathcona Accessibility Plan will be updated at least once every three years.” People can provide feedback online, and residents from throughout the region can provide information regarding barriers they have experienced or witnessed when accessing public services, programs and facilities. The SAIAC populated a list of barriers experienced, the public is also invited to add to this list through the feedback mechanism. The plan and feedback mechanism are located at www.srd.ca/accessibility .

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "Does Bayern Munich have another possible Manuel Neuer replacement on the horizon? Replacing a GOAT is never easy, and Neuer, 38, is as generation-defining as they come. So despite still having options on hand like Alexander Nübel — who just had a fine season on loan at Stuttgart and received a provisional call-up to Julian Nagelsmann’s EURO 2024 squad for Germany — and last season’s signing Daniel Peretz, the Bavarians are still on the hunt. Now they have identified FC Köln keeper Jonas Urbig, a 20-year-old Germany youth international who spent the last season on loan at SpVgg Greuther Fürth. If Bayern gets him, he would likely be sent out on loan to gain experience — perhaps joining both Nübel and Peretz in that department next year. From Sport Bild, via @iMiaSanMia : Bayern are interested in Köln and Germany U21 goalkeeper Jonas Urbig (20), who spent the season on loan at Greuther Fürth. Walter Junghans, former Bayern goalkeeper and current scout, was in attendance in Fürth several times to watch Armindo Sieb as well as Urbig. Urbig is considered one of the biggest goalkeeping talents in Germany and his style is reminiscent of Manuel Neuer. Should he join Bayern, he could be loaned out to develop further. For now, Urbig will return to Köln although the club is preparing for his potential departure [@BILD] In Nübel (27), Peretz (23), and now Urbig (20), Bayern would have a strong and age-staggered pipeline of goalkeeper reinforcements for whenever Neuer decides to hang up his boots. If the Bavarians can pull this off, credit to the front office for long-term planning. Looking for more thoughts and analysis of Bayern Munich’s potential hiring of Vincent Kompany, plus the latest transfer rumors involving Bayern and VfB Stuttgart’s Chris Führich, AC Milan ’s Theo Hernandez, and...Jamal Musiala?

        "description": "According to NBA insider Marc Stein, “it is believed” Darius Garland will request a trade if Donovan Mitchell signs an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers.",
        "content": "According to NBA insider Marc Stein , “it is believed” Darius Garland will request a trade if Donovan Mitchell signs an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group is Paul’s agent. “The Cavaliers remain hopeful that Mitchell, 27, agrees to a sign a four-year contract extension worth nearly $210 million after the NBA Finals ... though it is believed that scenario could prompt Rich Paul-repped Garland to seek a trade,” Stein wrote. Garland averaged 18.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 6.5 assists for the Cavaliers this season while shooting 44.6% from the field, 37.1% from beyond the arc and 83.4% from the free-throw line. The Cavaliers signed Garland to a five-year, $197 million extension in July 2022. The guard will make $36.7 million next season. During an interview with NBA reporter Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report , Paul was asked if Garland would request a trade from the Cavaliers if Mitchell signed an extension this summer. Paul gave Haynes a detailed answer. “There is not much to say,” Paul said. “I think people have their own opinions of what works and what doesn’t work. For me, I think people around the league know and you definitely know this about me, I’m very matter of fact with my approach on everything. If there was something to be discussed, I would discuss it. “As of now, there’s nothing to discuss on that. My job is to evaluate every situation for every guy that we as a company represent. I’m a representative of players and I help advise them on business decisions. It’s a lot more to it than just negotiating a contract after four years. Some guys choose to do that and only focus on that. I’m different. I try to look at everything.” The Cavaliers drafted Garland with the fifth pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. The 24-year-old has career averages of 18.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists. “You try to position guys a certain way to continue to have value,” Paul said. “It’s the same way I go about the draft. I think you know that as well. I’m not really focused on certain things in terms of rankings. The league is one that is fluid. It doesn’t stop for nobody. It continues to move on. “And so these guys have to make sure they understand that having the talent they have, and the production, allows them to maintain value. That value transitions into compensation and when you sum it all up, it’s really just a good ass job and sometimes you have to protect that for as long as you can. That’s where my mindset is for all the guys. No matter if they’re a max player or a minimum guy. My job is to prepare, educate and execute for my clients.” Garland has been linked to the San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Lakers in NBA trade rumors.

        "content": "It's Monday, and another week of action is in the books, which means it's time for ESPN's Power Rankings. Our Power Rankings are derived from a combination of key season statistics (points per game, goal differential, expected goal differential), recent performance, the Opta computer ratings and the observations of our writers. Who's climbing the table? Who's in free fall? We've ranked all 29 clubs in the league after Matchday 16. Let's dive in. 1 To the chagrin of eager away supporters hoping to see the GOAT, Miami beat Vancouver 2-1 with , and absent. That's a win in multiple ways for the Herons, who've come away with mixed results in matches missing Messi. and had the goals, with the latter marking his second goal in two straight games after he scored the match winner against D.C. 2 FCC picked up their seventh straight win after a 4-3 goal-fest with Toronto. The Blue and Orange are famous for victories by one-goal margins, and this one marks their ninth of the year, though Saturday's victory is unique in needing four goals to get it ( notched a brace and set up a third to achieve it). Cincinnati are consistent winners, but they'll rue allowing four goals at home, especially as they account for more than a quarter (28.5%) of the goals they've allowed this season. 3 By the 59th minute, RSL trailed 3-0 at Toyota Stadium in Texas, but resilience was key as they absconded with a draw. was first to take one back, kick-starting a three-goal response with off the bench for a banger and also off the bench to make it three. Despite the early setback, Pablo Mastroeni's squad showed grit and depth as they continue their 11-game unbeaten run. 4 picked up a brace in Orlando to seal a 2-0 victory on the road (their third straight win away from home) as the Crew wrapped up league play on a high note, before heading to Mexico for their clash with next weekend. 5 LAFC picked up their third straight win on the road in Atlanta after 's professional foul gave them a 1-0 lead from the penalty spot. It wasn't their cleanest game, but they're building momentum toward an end-of-season that could be scary. Somewhere across the ocean, wrapped up his season with as he readies to become the latest international star to join the Black and Gold. Mateusz Bogusz slots in the goal for LAFC 6 NYRB had a bye this weekend, allowing more time to nurse their wounds after falling to NYCFC in Rivalry Week. 7 Minnesota held sway over the game early but allowed Colorado to come creeping back. Loons' keeper made five saves and came up big at the penalty spot to keep from a brace, but allowed a flimsy goal just minutes later to end the game 3-3. 8 A 1-0 victory against the bottom-ranked team in the league isn't the most resounding victory. Still, a win is a win. This one comes complement of ' 81st-minute header assisted by . 9 The Galaxy came from behind to defeat Houston 2-1, breaking a five-game winless run with their first victory since April 21. and whipped in the goals to seal it. 10 Philly broke their six-game winless rut against the worst team in the league the weekend previous and took a point on the road with a 0-0 draw in Charlotte on Saturday. The team is still looking to get back toward their full potential, though a summer of uncertainty (the fate of could shift their season) and various international duties looms near. 14 Colorado clawed from behind to collect a draw after trailing 3-1 in the first half. Brazilian forward Rafael Navarro scored his fifth goal in five games to bring his season tally to nine, pressing his importance for Colorado as his loan nears its completion this June, with many hoping he'll stay in Colorado. 13 Another draw for Dean Smith's squad of formidable defending. Their visitors from Philly have scored 25 goals in 14 games, so a 0-0 clean sheet is yet more evidence of their firm foundations. Charlotte is tied with Columbus for the fewest goals allowed (13) in the league and ranked first for the fewest goals per game. 11 The scoreline was respectable for the Whitecaps, who fell 1-2 to visitors from Miami. But losing to the Herons before a record-setting crowd of 51,035 while Miami was missing Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets is a missed opportunity. On the plus side: the crowd seemed to enjoy themselves as they feasted on half-price food, even if they did chant, \"Where is Messi?\" at the beginning of the game. 12 D.C. made it a three-game winless run this weekend, though this time it was a draw. D.C. still has so much going for them (An MVP-worthy player in , for example), but taking just a point from among the worst teams in the league (Chicago Fire) is a poor way to capitalize. 17 Seattle left St. Louis with a 2-1 win Saturday night to mark their fourth win of the season, moving just inside the playoff spots for the first time this year. With 15 games gone and a lot of season left before us, ye olde West Coast juggernauts will hope to build on that playoff position momentum. A perfect through ball from Albert Rusnák is finished off by Jordan Morris. 👏 15 Toronto lost to FC Cincinnati at the weekend but can be proud of how they played. With absent due to yellow card accumulation, John Herdman's squad collected three goals against a team that's allowed just 14 in 15 games this season. (That's the third lowest in the league, with only Charlotte and Columbus allowing fewer.) 19 In Orlando's defense, Columbus have among the best keepers in the league in . Despite registering four big chances, Schulte saved them all and kept a clean sheet for the formidable visitors who kept their win streak alive on the road. 23 Portland sit 19th in the Supporters Shield race but third in goals scored (28) across the league. Only top-ranked teams Inter Miami and RSL have put more past their opposition. The Timbers can score. But can they defend? Remarkably, they also rank third across the league for goals conceded (30). If nothing else, they make for entertaining games, and this time the result went in their favor as they defeated SKC 2-1. set up the first and scored the second. ( finished the first and assisted the second). 18 's first goal of the year wasn't enough to offset the Galaxy's attacking inevitability (LA's 27 goals are the fourth most in MLS), as Houston succumbed to a 2-1 loss in LA. Still, in search of reliable goalscorers, Houston sit opposite end of the goal tally spectrum from the Galaxy, as they've notched just 13 in 14 games (second fewest in the league behind only New England). 16 Brad Guzan's professional foul brought Atlanta down to ten men in the 60th minute. The ensuing penalty gave LAFC a 1-0 lead which they saw out to the end. The loss makes it 9 without a win. Next up? Miami. 21 Austin is a team with heart, and they showed some on the road to come from behind to snag a draw against the San Jose Earthquakes. Their offensive production was looking a bit woeful, though, as they registered just five shots and only one on target against the team that's allowed more goals (34) than anyone else this season. 20 St. Louis were a bit unlucky in their loss to Seattle, conceding by way of an own goal before popped in to make it 2-0. They took one goal back but not enough to draw level, marking their second loss in as many games. Herculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. 22 Nashville picked up a 0-0 draw in their second match under new interim manager Rumba Munthali. The jury is still out on how the post-Gary Smith era will look this season. Incidentally, that's their seventh draw this year, putting them in a three-way tie for most in the league. 25 Dallas looked ready to do the unexpected Saturday, as they led 3-0 at home against the top-ranked West Coast side, Real Salt Lake. Tragically for the , s 61st-minute goal kickstarted a comeback that ended 3-3 by the final whistle. Silver lining? If fans manage to forget how things started, a point against RSL is still a result to be proud of. 24 They held Portland off for most of the match but Evander struck twice (first with an assist then with a goal) to ensure Kansas City their fifth straight loss in league play. They host Vancouver next at home with their season hitting a bit of freefall. 26 San Jose took the initial lead and came within a hair's breadth of all three points, but the post stopped them in stoppage time from what could have been their fourth win of the year. Alas, what could have been! Still, a 1-1 draw with Austin is respectable for a team that's lost 10 of their 15 games. 27 1-1 on the road against D.C. United is decent enough for the Fire. completed a solid team goal built patiently from the back, bringing them level from behind and showing hints of more quality the Fire may be hiding. 28 Montreal broke a four-game string of losses with a draw against Nashville. That's progress, especially since the last time they faced Nashville (May 4) they lost 4-1. That said, they still haven't won a game since April 13. 29 The Revs are as bad as you think they are. Actually, they could be worse. They did fire off 16 shots against NYCFC in a 1-0 loss at home, though none were real quality chances.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? OTTAWA – Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Advertisement",

        "content": "He doesn’t even play in the same conference as the Cowboys, but it seems Dallas doesn’t have love for Travis Kelce. The Kansas City Chiefs star took in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves and was roundly booed when shown on the video board. Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, looked surprised, though he might have just been playing the moment up. The mood of the crowd changed when Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany were shown when the camera panned over. The crowd roared and Mahomes stood up to encourage more cheering. Mahomes hails from the Dallas area. Travis Kelce got boo’d and the crowd went crazy for Patrick Mahomes. pic.twitter.com/ZSX9rLDg7a Star Mavericks player Luka Doncic was more welcoming toward Kelce than the fans were. As Kelce waited post-game near the locker room, Doncic came over and gave him a hug. The Mavericks have a 3-0 lead over Minnesota and are looking to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 when they upset LeBron James and the Miami Heat for the only NBA title in franchise history. The series resumes on Tuesday in Dallas. Luka Doncic and Travis Kelce after the Mavericks take the 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals. pic.twitter.com/7VkS24A2M4 Kelce had attended the game between the Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers earlier in the week. Kelce played pee wee hockey for eight years as a kid in the Cleveland area and has posted about his love of the game. Mahomes had jokingly told Kelce to “get out of (his) arena” when Kelce attended the hockey game. Perhaps that’s why he joined him for some hoops action. The other Dallas Mavericks star, Kyrie Irving, famously helped bring Cleveland its first major sports title since 1964 when the Cavaliers won in 2016, so it’s likely Kelce is a big fan of Irving.",

        "content": "BENGALURU: A month since fleeing the country after allegations that he had sexually abused multiple women, Karnataka MP and former PM HD Deve Gowda 's grandson Prajwal Revanna released a purported video statement Monday apologising to his family for being incommunicado and announced he would appear before investigators at 10 am on May 31. \"I will cooperate with the investigation and respond to the charges. I have faith in judiciary and God. I am confident of emerging victorious from these false cases,\" the Hassan MP says in the three-minute video in Kannada. State home minister G Parameshwara said the Hassan MP could \"face arrest as soon as he lands here\" since warrants had been issued against him. Everyone claims they are not guilty... SIT , based on evidence, will say what they have to,state home minister G Parameshwara said. Prajwal says in the video that he “went into depression” and “isolated” himself after MP Rahul Gandhi and other Congress functionaries defamed him publicly. “I was watching a news channel on YouTube when I learnt (about the sex abuse allegations). After that, SIT also issued a notice. I sought a week’s time to respond to the SIT notice through my lawyers and X handle.” The suspended JD(S) functionary alleges that several people in his constituency conspired against him “as I was growing politically in Hassan”. “Looking at all these things, I was shocked; so I was a bit away. No one should mistake my absence for fleeing.” Prajwal, who is seeking re-election from Hassan, insists in the video that his trip was planned before the allegations surfaced. “There was no case against me at the time, and SIT was “not formed” either. Addressing his family and supporters, the son of former minister HD Revanna says, “I apologise to my parents, my grandfather, (uncle) Kumaraswamy and my party workers, and the people of the state. I have come before you to share information as I had (so far) not disclosed where I am abroad. Let the blessings of God, people, and my family be upon me. After arriving (in India), I will endeavour to put an end to all this. Have faith in me.” JD(S) patriarch Deve Gowda recently directed Prajwal to return to India and face the probe into allegations against him, while asserting there would be no interference from him or other family members. He said his grandson should be given the harshest punishment under the law, if found guilty. Congress govt in Karnataka wrote to Centre thrice, seeking revocation of Prajwal’s diplomatic passport. MEA then served him a show-cause.",

        "content": "Overwatch 2 devs indicated plans to buff Mercy in an upcoming patch and revealed that they’re listening to players about implementing a highly requested change for the support hero. Mercy has been one of the most popular heroes in Overwatch since the game’s release, with many players taking a liking to her kit. While not necessarily powerful offensively, Mercy’s healing, damage boost, and game-changing resurrection ability make her stand out from the rest of the cast through her utility. However, after , making it so dealing damage prevents enemies from receiving 20% of their healing, Mercy mains have been and believe their character needs some updating. In a in May, Hero Designer Alec Dawson explained the team is open to giving Mercy some love, especially with the DPS passive leaving some of Mercy’s healing on the weaker side. “I think we are more happy in the 20% DPS Passive world than the 15% (it cuts through a lot better, helps mitigate the healing more effectively) so Mercy is more worth a look when that world is permanent,” he said. Dawson also revealed that the team is currently taking a look at “how far” they can push Mercy’s movement, noting that it’s one of the “most requested changes” for the hero. Interestingly, the dev further added that Mercy remains one of the top-picked supports, especially on console, up until GM and Top 500 ranks. “Her performance follows a similar trend, where she’s in the top grouping for most ranks and remains above average at the highest ranks. Doesn’t mean that she won’t receive changes but that is where she is at currently,” Dawson explained. Although the dev provided no timeline for the buffs, he suggested a slew of changes to Reaper, Cassidy, and could be coming once Season 11 starts, so it’s possible that Mercy could be among the heroes getting an update in the coming weeks.

        "description": "Two days after the General Assembly was scheduled to adjourn its spring session, Democrats in the Illinois Senate advanced a $53.1 billion budget to the House Sunday night, where leaders expect it to pass without changes.",
        "content": "Two days after the was scheduled to adjourn its spring session, Democrats in the Illinois Senate advanced a $53.1 billion budget to the House Sunday night, where leaders expect it to pass without changes. The fiscal year 2025 spending plan, which came together over a stretch of late nights and closed-door dealmaking, spends $400 million more than what in his February budget address. Despite controlling the governor’s mansion and both chambers of the legislature, Democrats had a rocky time coming to an agreement, as evidenced during floor debate of the bill. In a rare move, a few Democrats publicly aired their disappointment with their party’s budget priorities before ultimately voting for it, while a pair of Democrats quietly voted no. “I wish this were a perfect budget,” lead budget negotiator Sen. Elgie Sims, D- , said before the vote. “I’ve been here many years and I have yet to see one. But...this budget is fair, it’s balanced, and it provides certainty for us investing in our future.” The budget, which is set to take effect on July 1, would increase spending by 5% from last year’s enacted budget, but just 1.6% when factoring in supplemental spending for the current year. It also reduced spending in several areas from ’s February budget proposal by a total of about $73 million, according to Sims, although Democrats did not provide a list of the cuts. The spending plan directs a $350 million increase for K-12 education and full funding for year two of Pritzker’s “Smart Start” plan aimed at adding 5,000 preschool seats across the state and providing workforce grants. The plan would send $198 million to the state’s “rainy day” fund and make the full pension payment required by law. The budget also includes a child tax credit for qualifying children under the age of 12, providing parents a credit of 20% of the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit in calendar year 2024 and 40% in 2025. That would come at a cost of $50 million in FY25 and $100 million the following year, up from the $12 million proposed by Pritzker. It includes the $182 million Pritzker committed months ago to provide shelter, health care and other services for recently arrived migrants, many of whom have been bused to the state from Texas. Two programs providing state-funded Medicaid-like benefits to noncitizens would receive $440 million from the General Revenue Fund, or $629 million total with other state funds. It’s an overall funding increase from what was allocated in this year’s budget, although the GRF commitment would be smaller in FY25. The spending plan on a 38-21 vote, with Democrats Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, and Suzy Glowiak-Hilton, D-Western Springs, joining Republicans in opposition. A third Democrat, Sen. Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, later voted against a revenue bill that raised certain taxes. Republicans accused Pritzker of being driven by presidential aspirations and criticized him for growing state spending by about $13 billion since his first year in office in 2019. “But today, I’d like to say that Governor Pritzker is keeping his promise,” Sen. Sally Turner, R-Springfield, said during floor debate. “He’s keeping his promise to raise taxes on Illinois citizens by a billion dollars a year to fund the migrant crisis that he’s created.” But the GOP also criticized Democrats for underfunding state and federally mandated programs at K-12 schools by $135 million from what the state education board requested. And they panned the governor for allocating about 17% less than the current year to the Prisoner Review Board. “I’m a little confused,” Sims said during floor debate. “Because I couldn’t really understand if you want more spending or less.” Some Democrats also lamented that “finite resources” prohibited greater investments in youth-focused programing. “While I rise to acknowledge there are incredible things inside of this budget, many good things, I cannot – my conscience won’t allow me to sit in this seat and not lift up the fact that we have not gone far enough for a particular group, which are young, poor, Black people and Latinos,” Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, said. The budget includes a $1 per hour increase in wages for direct service professionals in community-based settings that serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Community Care Program workers who serve older adults who can’t live independently will see a rate increase as well. The budget anticipates $53.3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that will begin on July 1, about $1.2 billion of which comes from various tax code changes. The revenue plan was part of why the spring legislative session went beyond Democrats’ May 24 self-imposed deadline written into the calendar months ago, as powerful Statehouse lobbying groups lined up against some of its components. But ultimately, it tracks closely with the governor’s proposal. “Every session I found has its own rhythm and each budget is its own beast. And this one was a doozy,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said just before the Senate adjourned. “There is no doubt about that.” It extends a cap on corporate net operating losses to generate $526 million and imposes a new graduated tax on sportsbooks, increasing it from the current 15% to a new range between 20 and 40%, which is estimated to generate $200 million next year. The tax rate on Illinois’ video gambling industry would also see a 1% increase, which goes toward infrastructure spending. Pritzker had also sought a $1,000 monthly cap on the “retailers’ discount,” which was included in the plan. The discount allows retailers to keep 1.75% of the sales tax they collect but capping it at $1,000 monthly would bring in $101 million for the state’s general fund. Third-party “re-renters” of hotel rooms will also be subject to the existing hotel tax under the plan. To appease retailers, lawmakers included a prohibition that bans financial institutions and credit card companies from charging fees on the sales tax portion of electronic transactions. The personal income tax was not affected by the law, as the approved budget didn’t decrease the standard deduction claimed by millions of Illinoisans, as Pritzker had proposed in February. The budget package also calls for transferring $150 million from the state’s Road Fund to public transit expenses, freeing up general funds for other purposes in a move that was opposed by the state’s road builders. The revenue proposal would also create a $5 million tax credit program for news outlets beginning in 2025 and claimable the following year, providing $15,000 per employee for certain newsrooms and another $10,000 for new hires. Another $50 million from the little-used Leaking Underground Storage Tank fund will be directed to public transit spending as well. the state’s 1% tax on grocery items as sought by Pritzker – a tax that benefits the state’s municipalities, rather than state government. Groups like the Illinois Municipal League pushed back against the repeal – though they supported the extra $85 million in revenue for local governments that would result from the retailers’ discount cap. The grocery tax repeal was also pushed back to Jan. 1, 2026, and the bill allows local governments to implement their own grocery taxes up to 1% without a referendum and without requiring state administrative fees. Municipalities with home rule authority would be allowed to increase their sales tax by up to 1% without a referendum. “Only in Springfield are we going to do a victory lap that really just reassigns the blame and responsibility to local municipalities and call it a tax cut,” Sen. Andrew Chesney, R-Freeport, said of the measure to increase local taxing authority. The House is slated to return as early as Tuesday to consider the spending plan and associated measures. In an interview after Sunday evening’s spending plan vote, Sims told reporters there was agreement between Democrats in the House and the Senate that there would be no further amendments. “So I would expect the bill that you just saw us vote on be the budget in the state of Illinois come July 1,” he said.",

        "content": "Clouds, puddles and a strong breeze greeted parade-goers on Monday during the Memorial Day Parade in Sterling Heights along Dodge Park Road. The cool temperatures — it was only 69 degrees when the procession left City Hall at 10 a.m. — likely were the cause of the diminished number of spectators who took up seats on the parade route down to Heritage Junior High School on 16 Mile Road. But that didn’t stop Todd and Allison Caruss from showing up. They came along with their daughter, Kayla, and family dog, Roxy, a five-year-old black Labrador who seemed to enjoy the snacks she received from those in the parade. “We were coming anyway,” Allison Caruss said of the rainy conditions that preceded the event. “We’ve come every year since we moved here. We just enjoy watching everyone in the parade, and we live on the other side of 16 (Mile), so we walk over and take it all in.” Now in its 45th year, the parade’s theme was “Salute to Service: Honoring Heroes & Innovations.” It featured military groups, service clubs, high school bands, elected officials, dance studios, towing companies, classic cars, and businesses. “It’s all about family,” said Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido, who had relatives and volunteers join him walking behind a banana-yellow 2002 Ford Thunderbird convertible. Among the elected officials walking the route were Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist, Congressman John James, Sterling Heights Mayor Michael Taylor and members of the City Council, state representatives Nate Shannon of Sterling Heights and Thomas Kuhn of Troy, county commissioners Joe Romano and Don VanSyckel, and 41A District Court judges Annemarie Lepore, Douglas Shepherd, and Kimberly Wiegand. Gilchrist agreed that, regardless of the weather, he felt it was important to be in attendance. “These kind of gatherings give us a chance to remember and reflect, so I am proud to have my wife and youngest child out here to be in the community,” he said. “It’s important for us to mark this moment every year, it’s important for me to be present in the community and show our families of those have passed away during their service, but also for our veterans who are still here and still carry everything their service means to them on their shoulders and hearts. That’s why it’s important to me.” Before the parade, a ceremony honoring those who gave their lives in defense of the United States was held outside of City Hall. It featured remarks by dignitaries, music from the Motor City Blend Chorus, and a performance by the 1st Michigan Colonial Fife & Drum Corps, which are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year. Elsewhere in Macomb County, parades or solemn ceremonies were held Monday at Resurrection Cemetery in Clinton Township, and in Armada, Eastpointe, New Baltimore, Romeo, and Roseville.",

        "content": "Simon Cowell was the target of loud boos from the Britain's Got Talent crowd on Monday night, as he 'turned' on his own Golden Buzzer act Duo Stardust and gave them some negative feedback for their semi final performance. Just two days earlier, ITV viewers saw Simon 'break the rules' at the auditions, by hitting the Buzzer for the skating pair, who'd jetted over from Ukraine to try out for BGT. He cracked under pressure from the theatre audience to put Stardust through to the semi finals, having been massively impressed by their daring performance. However, he was far from their biggest cheerleader on Monday, with the other Britain's Got Talent judges stepping into defend them, as Simon took aim at Duo Stardust's semi final routine. The number saw then surrounded by dancers with flames, with Bruno Tonioli even roped in at the last minute to have a starring tole in the performance, as he was lifted in the air and spun round by the skaters.

Simon continued \"I'm disappointed and I'll tell you why. I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight, which is a real shame.\" As the boos continued, he then added: \"And I'm saying this about an act I gave a Golden Buzzer to, but I can only say how I feel, which was that.

Now, officials are warning anyone who may have been at the airport on May 19 to check if they were exposed. The individual in question arrived at Gate 156 at Tom Bradley International Terminal on May 19 at 3:04 p.m. aboard Lufthansa flight LH452, which according to online flight tracking service FlightAware, is the airline’s Munich, Germany to Los Angeles route. After a five-hour layover, the traveler connected to Lufthansa flight LH7852 out of Terminal 7, Gate 82 around 8 p.m., the health department said. Flight LH7852 goes from LAX to Fresno; according to FlightAware, the route is operated by SkyWest Airlines as flight SKW5591. Massive fire at Oakland lumber warehouse under investigationThere are no other locations where possible exposures to this traveler may have occurred, public health department officials confirmed.“Individuals who were at LAX Tom Bradley International Terminal from approximately 3:04 p.m. to 9 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler,” L.A. County Public Health officials said. Local health departments, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, are notifying passengers assigned to specific seats that may have been exposed on LH452 on May 18-19 and LH7852 (SKW5591) on May 19. “Exposed individuals should confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles...if they have not had measles in the past and have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, they are at risk of contracting measles if they have been exposed,” L.A. County health officials said. “Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at this location during the date and time are at risk of developing measles from seven to 21 days after being exposed.” If potentially exposed victims do not show symptoms by 21 days after exposure – which would be June 9 – they are no longer at risk, the health department added. “Measles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know you have it and can lead to severe disease,” Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County Health Officer, said. “Measles is highly contagious for those who are not immune to it...it can result in serious complications for young children and vulnerable adults.” According to public health officials, common measles symptoms include:High fever (higher than 101 degrees) Cough Runny nose Red and watery eyes Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness; typically starts at the face and then spreads to the rest of the body Individuals who develop symptoms are urged to stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Notify a healthcare provider immediately but do not enter any healthcare facility before calling them and making them aware of individuals’ exposure and symptoms, the health department said. Most health insurances cover the cost of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR); uninsured or underinsured children and adults can access free or low-cost vaccines at clinics enrolled in the Vaccines for Children and Vaccines for Adults programs.

        "content": "TORONTO — Canada's main stock index posted a small gain Monday, helped by strength in energy and industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 52.51 points at 22,373.38. With U.S. stock markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, things were relatively quiet north of the border since Wall Street has a lot of sway over Bay Street, said Les Stelmach, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. In Canada, this week will bring earnings from major banks after TD kicked off the group last week. The bank reported lower profits for the quarter as it booked costs related to U.S. investigations into its anti-money laundering program. Investors will be looking for how much money the banks are setting aside for bad loans, said Stelmach. “I think bank earnings have been resilient through most economic cycles, but there's just a continuing theme about stress on the consumer, higher mortgage rates, rollover of mortgages, as we persist in this higher interest rate environment,” said Stelmach. “I don’t think you’ll see anything earth-shattering in the quarterly results,” he added. As has been the case in recent months, markets will be eyeing the banks’ outlooks for the rest of the year, said Stelmach, reflecting ongoing uncertainty after expectations for interest rate cuts have been rapidly dwindling as the year progresses. “Inflation is still a concern in the U.S. particularly, and so that might keep (the U.S. Federal Reserve) on the sidelines longer than people think,” he said. Heading into 2024, markets were pricing in about six rate cuts by the Fed this year, said Stelmach, but that's been pared back significantly. Now, many market watchers think it's possible that the central bank could cut just once in 2024, after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data has dampened hopes for lower rates. In Canada, the economic data is much more supportive of a rate cut, said Stelmach, but the Bank of Canada is in a tough spot because it doesn’t want to diverge too much from the Fed. Diverging too much could affect the Canadian dollar, he said, and put Canada in a difficult position if any economic surprises change the trajectory of rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. This week will also bring economic reports in the U.S. on consumer confidence, GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which Stelmach said is another important indicator of inflation. “The U.S. economy more broadly has been stronger than people have expected it to be,” he said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.34 cents US compared with 73.14 cents US on Friday. Commodity markets were also closed for the U.S. holiday.

Senator Oluremi Tinubu, wife of President Bola Tinubu, didn’t hold back as she took aim at the pervasive influence of Hollywood’s risqué fashion trends . Speaking in Abuja to mark the first anniversary of her husband’s administration, Tinubu urged teenagers and young people to dress more modestly and reject the scantily-clad styles popularized by US stars. “We have to salvage our children,” she declared. “We see the way they dress. We are not having the Met Gala. And everyone, the nakedness, is just everywhere and the men are well-clothed.” She continued, “Tell them we don’t accept nakedness in our culture. That is not beautiful. It’s not beautiful at all.” While Tinubu didn’t explicitly criticize Meghan Markle, she referenced the Duchess’s recent visit to Nigeria where Markle emphasized her Nigerian roots , revealing she is 43% Nigerian according to a DNA test. “Why did Meghan come here looking for Africa? That is something we have to take home with [us]. We know who we are. Don’t lose who you are,” Tinubu stated. Markle and Prince Harry’s trip to Nigeria, intended to promote the Invictus Games, garnered mixed reactions. Some experts criticized Markle’s choice of expensive and revealing outfits, suggesting she could have shown “more modesty” in a country where just over half of the population are Muslim. One fashion expert noted that Markle “bared too much skin” and would likely have dressed more conservatively had the trip been organized by Buckingham Palace. During her speech, Tinubu emphasized Nigerian women’s beauty and urged them to be confident in their identity. “They’re all beautiful girls, but they should be confident in who they are,” she said. “We are fashionable, we see what is going on.” The First Lady also called on Nigerian women to become unifying forces in their homes and communities, promoting greater prosperity for the nation. “When mothers stand with you, the house is in order,” she asserted. “Looking ahead, we must endeavor to become the unifying force in our homes and our communities, to bring about greater prosperity for our nation.” The Sussexes’ three-day visit to Nigeria marked their first official trip to Africa since stepping down as working royals and relocating to California. Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, the couple received warm welcomes despite the controversy surrounding Markle’s wardrobe choices. Prince Harry praised Nigerian athletes, saying they represented their country extraordinarily at the last competition, winning medals and returning with smiles. The royal was moved by plans for a new Invictus Games center in Nigeria. At a reception hosted by Nigeria’s Chief of Defense Staff Christopher Musa, Harry expressed excitement over the upcoming facility in Abuja, aimed at assisting war veterans with rehabilitation. “Seeing the plans for the new Invictus Centre gives me goosebumps,” he said. The Duke and Duchess now reside in California with their children, Princess Lilibet and Prince Archie.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES -- Mike Tyson suffered a medical issue Sunday during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles International Airport, a spokesperson for the boxing legend confirmed to ABC News. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great. He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,\" the boxer's representative said in a statement. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him. \"However, it's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the statement said. \"This two hour delay was due to air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" American Airlines did not immediately respond to ABC7's request for comment. The incident, which was first reported by In Touch Weekly , comes as the 57-year-old Tyson is preparing for his planned summer fight in Texas with Jake Paul. On May 16, Tyson and Paul traded insults and expletives as they previewed the fight just a few football fields from the site of the planned July 20 bout, the 80,000-seat home of the Dallas Cowboys. Paul downplayed the suggestion that the 27-year-old social media star-turned-boxer still hasn't had a legitimate opponent, while Tyson simply refused to answer a question about his age. The former heavyweight champion will be 58 on July 20, when the fight is set for AT &T Stadium. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition in November 2000 against Roy Jones at downtown L.A.'s Crypto.com Arena, which wouldn't declare it a pro fight. Tyson was mostly annoyed by the scene and the questions, including when asked what it meant to have a chance to fill AT &T Stadium. \"I was doing this years ago, so this is nothing new to me,\" said Tyson, who won 50 fights with 44 knockouts before retiring. \"This is new to this young boy over here.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The Michigan resident said that squatters did drugs in the backyard and brought \"beat up\" campers onto the property.",
        "content": "A Michigan man offered to pay $15,000 to tear down a nearby home occupied by squatters. A squatter is any individual who decides to inhabit a piece of land or a building in which they have no legal right to occupy, according to the American Apartment Owners Association. The squatter lives in the building or on the property they select without paying rent and without lawful documentation stating they own the property. Laws regarding squatters' rights are facing new scrutiny after property owners in several states found themselves embroiled in disputes, which sometimes turned violent, over people residing in their properties without their permission. Proponents of squatters' rights argue these laws prevent landlords from taking advantage of tenants. However, critics have argued the laws leave property owners with little remedy to deal with squatters. Demarko Smith, a resident of Dowagiac, Michigan, told Digital in an interview published Monday that he is offering to purchase a home to deal with squatters who have moved into a vacant property in his neighborhood. Smith's squatter situation began more than three years ago when his neighbor allowed a man and his friends to move into her backyard. The man, he told the outlet, brought in \"beat up\" campers and old appliances. Two years later, Smith's neighbor died. Her family was unable to take back the property due to squatter laws in the state, allowing the alleged squatters to take it over and making it more difficult to live next door to them, he said. They allegedly did drugs in the backyard, limiting the time Smith and his family could spend in their backyard due to the smell of drugs. He tried to build a fence around his property, but someone tore it down, he said. The bank was eventually able to evict the alleged squatters, but they moved to another home in the area that was listed for sale on websites like Zillow for more than $100,000 but had damage to the roof and wiring, he said. \"I'll offer them $15,000 for it. I just want to tear it down and have the property,\" Smith told the news outlet. reached out to Smith via message and the Dowagiac Police Department via email for comment. Stories like Smith's have drawn more attention to squatters' rights and prompted legislators across the U.S. to aimed at making it easier for homeowners to remove squatters. In April, the Biden administration to tackle the issue. \"My understanding is that this is obviously a local issue. We are certainly tracking that issue. The rights of property owners and renters must be protected, and we believe that ultimately, what needs to happen is the local government needs to make sure that they address this and they take action,\" White House press secretary said during a briefing in April. \"What I can say is that ultimately this is a local issue and it is critical that local governments take action to address it.\" Laws regarding squatters . Squatting is a crime in Michigan, but squatters do have some rights, like not being violently removed from a property. A first-time offense carries a penalty of up to 180 days in jail and up to a $5,000 fine.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans have been left scratching their heads after one act appeared to return for the live semi-finals with 'new teeth'. Viewers of the ITV1 show are convinced the contestant had jetted off to Turkey for a new set of gnashers following her first audition. Taryn Charles, 39, made her BGT comeback for the first of this week's live semi-finals and was quick to show off her smile. The singer, who was one of judge Bruno Tonioli's Golden Buzzer acts, chatted to the cameras before belting out Teddy Swims' Lose Control. But watching at home, viewers were quick to point put Taryn's apparent bright new smile. One wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"Taryn’s teeth are looking a lot whiter this week!\" Another added: \"She's got new teeth!\" And a third joked: \"I wonder who paid for her Turkey teeth?\" Taryn first wowed Britain's Got Talent viewers by singing (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin for her initial audition. Judges Simon Cowell , Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon were impressed and gave her a standing ovation, but not as much as Bruno. The Italian star awarded music teacher Taryn the Golden Buzzer, which put her straight through to this week's live semi-finals. Taryn returned on Monday night and she looked a far cry from how she looked for her first audition. The singer had swapped her denim jumpsuit for a sophisticated black trouser suit and her hair had been styled into soft waves. Once again, Bruno was on his feet after listening to Taryn sing for a second time. Unfortunately, Taryn has found herself dragged into a 'fix' row since finding herself in the spotlight thanks to BGT. It came after it was revealed she had already appeared on another ITV singing show. Viewers recognised her from Starstruck, a singing contest where members of the public impersonate showbiz stars. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight . Olly Murs hosted the show with Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight among the judges as ordinary people turned into Lady Gaga , Ariana Grande and Michael Buble among others. Taryn appeared as Whitney Houston and sang \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" along with two other singers. But insiders told The Sun despite the acts taking multiple leaps at stardom, there is \"no unfair advantage\". \"The winner is crowned by the public vote,\" they said. \"It’s fair game, as all acts are voted for by the public. \"The show has never hidden the fact that auditions are open to everybody, irrespective of previous experience, and everybody is given the same opportunity on the show”. Taryn describes herself as a \"neurodivergent warrior\" on Instagram . Neurodivergence is an umbrella term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently to 'neurotypical' peoples' brains.",

        "content": "Shania Twain is in the middle of her Come On Over tour, but the 58-year-old revealed on Monday that she is taking time off. Alongside a carousel of incredible photos taken on stage, Shania wrote: \"What a way to end the first leg of my Come On Over residency! Thank you to everyone for coming out and partying with us... Roll on August when we’re back for round two!!\" Shania has certainly left fans wanting more, with the collection of photos giving an insight into her sensational onstage outfits, with thigh-high boots, tiny shorts and cowboy hats a key component of her ensembles. Proving that she's as limber as ever, the 58-year-old performed a gravity-defying high-kick in one photo, with her slender leg high in the air – despite the fact she was wearing towering thigh-high platform boots. Another of her daring outfits saw Shania don a pink trench coat with matching silk lingerie underneath – perfect for her . A third outfit change saw the singer head back to her country roots, wearing a cowboy hat and glittering boots as she sits atop a saloon bar, strumming an acoustic guitar. In another outfit, Shania channels fellow country-turned-pop singer Taylor Swift in bejeweled boots that would look right at home on Taylor's Era's Tour. Taylor has spoken about how Shania inspired her move from country music to pop domination, so we bet she loves that her idol has taken inspiration from her in return. While she's performing, Shania makes sure to take good care of herself, sharing she follows a strict diet during her residency. \"I only drink fluids all day until after the show. I drink my food, so I blend my food. Lots of blended ­spinach and blueberries,\" she told The Sun. It's no surprise that Shania looks after herself given she had a which left her fearing for her voice. In her documentary, , she shared that in 2003 she was riding her house when she was bitten by a tick. \"The tick was infected with Lyme's Disease, and I did get Lyme's Disease and my symptoms were quite scary.\" The singer explained she experienced millisecond blackouts every 30 seconds, and while she recovered from these issues, she worried that her voice was never the same again. Shania eventually got her voice to a place where she felt comfortable enough to sing again, and a decade on, she took to the stage once more, signing up to do a Las Vegas residency in 2012 – she must have loved it, given she's in the midst of another one now!

The show that in addition to the 37 confirmed cases, there are also 16 suspected cases currently under investigation. Suspected cases of measles are tested in a laboratory, before being either officially confirmed as measles or denotified and several possible measles cases have been declassified in recent weeks. Six outbreaks have occurred so far in 2024, all of which occurred in private houses and involved between two and five cases in each outbreak. Of the 37 confirmed cases this year, 18 are male, 17 are female, and the gender has not been recorded for two cases. One case has been recorded within the 45-54 age group, and all the other cases are among people aged 34 and lower. Ten cases have been confirmed among those aged 25-34, four cases among those aged 20-24, and the other 22 cases are among people aged 1-19. Last Thursday, The Ryanair flight FR123 travelled to Ireland on 16 May at 8.10pm.

Measles is a highly infectious disease that can cause serious complications. Particularly vulnerable groups are children under one year of age, pregnant women, and people who are immunosuppressed. A measles infection tends to start with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after a person is infected, followed a few days later by a rash. Symptoms include:",

        "content": "Goodful · Posted 17 minutes ago \"Pickleball Can Be Such A Mood Booster\": This Sport Has Some Major Health Benefits That You Should Know About A new study reveals that the popular sport may be more than just a fun workout. by Julia Ries HuffPost Contributor Link Facebook Pinterest Twitter Mail RichLegg via Getty Images By now, you’ve probably seen a headline or two (or 200) labeling pickleball the “ fastest-growing sport in the country .” Pickleball courts , clubs and leagues have popped up all over the country, and nearly 50 million people, or 19% of Americans, picked up a paddle last year, according to the Association of Pickleball Professionals . According to people who play, there are a ton of reasons why pickleball exploded in popularity: it’s fun and competitive. It’s a great way to make friends, plus it’s largely inclusive — people of all ages and skill levels can join in. But perhaps the biggest selling point for playing pickleball is how beneficial it can be for our mental health. A new report from Apple investigated the health benefits of pickleball using data gathered from Apple Watch users who opted into the study and found that playing pickleball is not only an impressive workout that can boost our cardiovascular and metabolic health, it’s also associated with lower rates of self-reported depression. Per the study, the self-reported scores of depressive symptoms were 60% lower among frequent pickleball players compared to the general group of study participants. Long story short: racket sports help people work out their body and their mind, making them one of the healthiest physical activities available. “The potential reasons for this observation could be attributed to a number of different reasons, including the sport’s impact on hormones, neuromuscular coordination, resilience and more,” principal investigator of the study Dr. Calum MacRae , a cardiologist and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, told HuffPost. Why Pickleball Can Be A Powerful Mood Booster According to MacRae, sports, including pickleball, provide numerous physical and mental health benefits. When you participate in an aerobic activity like pickleball, your body releases endorphins , or hormones that relieve pain, reduce stress, and boost well-being. Playing pickleball is also a fun and efficient way of meeting the recommended guidance for physical activity (150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week). Physical activity is known to improve quality of life and promote healthy aging, especially in older adults, evidence consistently shows. And, as the Apple report revealed, pickleball games last roughly 90 minutes on average, helping you knock out half the amount of weekly physical activity needed in just one session. July Alcantara / Getty Images Pickleball also gives people the opportunity to stay connected with friends and family or develop new relationships. When people join leagues, for example, they might form a new sense of community and belonging. Plus, it’s inclusive: You can play with people of all ages, skill levels and backgrounds. “Humans thrive when we experience connection, and pickleball allows us to bond with one another through an activity that also physically makes us feel good,” said Emily Hemendinger , an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. It can also provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. “Playing a sport, such as pickleball, can give people a goal to work towards, whether it’s winning a game, meeting people, or improving one’s skills,” Hemendinger said. Winning, in particular, can lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment, she added. Pickleball Keeps Your Brain Sharp, Too Another theory from MacRae as to why pickleball can be such a mood booster: playing pickleball outdoors may increase exposure to natural daylight. And the more natural light we’re exposed to, the better our sleep quality, activity levels, and overall quality of life are, research suggests. That’s not all. The game also requires people to pay attention and think quickly and strategically. If you get distracted, for example, you run the risk of getting hit in the face with the ball or letting down your partner. Physical activities that require strategic thinking promote cognitive functioning, which can help prevent cognitive decline . “Some studies have even found that sports like pickleball and racket sports can improve memory and processing speed,” Hemendinger said. In short: pickleball not only works out your body, it exercises your mind . Taking care of your brain through thinking and problem-solving activities can help decrease stress and anxiety. “Any type of mindful movement, especially with others, can improve mood and help your physical and mental health,” Hemendinger said. Visual Vic via Getty Images How To Start Playing Pickleball Landon Uetz , a physical therapist and pickleball instructor on TeachMe.To , said the pickleball community is very welcoming of new players. Before playing, it can be helpful to watch a video online to get a basic understanding of the rules. And if you’re hesitant about stepping onto a court — whether that be due to fear of not knowing the rules, getting hurt or failing — consider getting a lesson, Uetz said. Before you jump into a game, it’s worth warming up , either through dynamic stretching or movement exercises (think: jumping jacks, light jogging or lunges). When coming from a sedentary state — whether that’s at work, at home or after waking up — it’s important to increase circulation throughout your body. A warm-up loosens up your muscles, bones, ligaments and gets ready for activity, which can reduce the risk of pain or injury, Uetz said. Photodjo / Getty Images If you have any injuries, check in with a health care provider before you give pickleball a go. They may be able to provide some advice as to whether it’s safe for you to participate or if there are any modifications you can do during a game to protect from injury. According to Hemendinger, as with all things, moderation is key. “Doing any physical activity too much may lead to injury or exhaustion,” she said. Listen to your body — if certain muscles start to ache, consider ramping up more gradually. Instead of playing for two hours, for example, try to hit the ball around for 30 minutes, Uetz said. Even short bursts of activity can offer tremendous mental health benefits. “Whether it’s for 15 minutes or 90 minutes, getting out and moving your body mindfully and resetting your nervous system from a stressful day is a reliable stress reliever and coping skill,” Hemendinger said.

        "content": "As scattered showers have already made for a rainy Memorial Day in Hampton Roads, more bad weather is expected this evening. The National Weather Service at Wakefield issued a tornado watch Monday afternoon for parts of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and the District of Columbia until 11 p.m. The tornado watch covers all of Hampton Roads and northeast North Carolina. Other locations impacted in Virginia include Richmond and Fredericksburg. NWS advises those under a tornado watch to choose a safe location and prepare to move quickly in case a warning is issued. A tornado watch means weather conditions could lead to the formation of a tornado, whereas a tornado warning means a tornado has been spotted or is about to occur. During a warning, people are advised to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building and avoid windows. Scattered thunderstorms are also possible this evening. Allison Mitchell, a meteorologist with NWS, said hail and high winds are also possible threats. “As far as wind goes, we are looking at potential gusts of up to 70 miles per hour,” she said. “For hail, probably most quarter-inch sized, but there is potential for isolated incidents of ping pong size hail.” Mitchell said the weather in Hampton Roads is expected to clear up on Tuesday.

        "content": "EMMERDALE fans have been appalled by a recent storyline on the soap, and are now begging producers to bin it altogether after becoming frustrated while watching one character suffer. Tom King has been abusing his wife Belle Dingle, and things have escalated in recent weeks as he went from belittling her to all out violence. The tearful woman attempted to stand up for herself and kicked him out of the house after he brutally punched her , but Tom managed to worm his way back into her life. The vet soon convinced his wife she was the one really at fault as he began manipulating her to think she wasn't taking her medication. When he mocked the anniversary of her mother's death, Belle finally snapped and pushed him to the ground in front of other villagers, leaving him with scrapes and cuts. Horrified by herself, she called a mental health crisis team and ended up checking herself into an assessment centre overnight. In tonight's installment of the ITV soap the confused woman tried to make sense of what was happening between her and Tom, telling a crisis counsellor that the breakdown in their marriage was all her fault. She seems to have fallen for his gaslighting ways and kept insisting that her husband is her soulmate and she doesn't know why she tries to push him away. Viewers had been hoping that her time away from home would make her come to her senses, and were left frustrated to see that Belle is no closer to escaping from Tom's clutches. Emmerdale fans took to social media to complain about the drawn out storyline, with one asking: \"When are you going to get rid of that horrible man Tom? You don't realise how hard it is for someone with mental problems. He is a nasty person and does not make good watching.\" Another groaned: \"Hate this storyline. There is no way that Belle can be so naive and vulnerable given all that she’s been through. I’m so over Emmerdale . All the stories are miserable. Haven’t watched in 2 weeks and haven’t missed it a bit.\" A third begged: \"Please don’t prolong this storyline. It’s horrendous and Belle isn’t that stupid. You’re forcing her to be stupid.\" Things only went from bad to worse as Tom decided to take drastic measures to get Belle back home, fearing she would realise the extent of his abuse while receiving psychiatric care. He was shown threatening her dog Piper while preparing a syringe to inject the animal with. Horrified viewers made complaints to Ofcom , with some people who have been watching the soap for decades saying they will never turn it on again if he has killed the furball. One fan fumed: \"If Emmerdale shows piper dead tomorrow, and has detailed a healthy animal has been put down.. totally done with the soap, that's it! To screen such details tonight at 7.20pm with no on screen warning even thinking it wouldn't upset people bad mistake ITV.\" Another chimed in: \"Reported to Ofcom for showing this.\" A third chimed in: \"I agree as much as I love Emmerdale the whole story line in general has broke my heart but tonight’s episode went too far.\" Someone else warned: \"If Tom kills the poor cute dog I will never watch Emmerdale again. I have been a fan for over 40 years.\" A fifth blasted: \"This was really disgusting you’ve gone too far now, end this disgusting storyline. You won’t be getting any votes for the NTA’s with this evil.\" Everything you need to know about Emmerdale",

        "content": "Netanyahu admits 'tragic mistake' after Israeli strike in Rafah By Miriam Kuepper and Perkin Amalaraj Published: 16:23 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:24 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail Advertisement Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted 'tragic mistake' after an Israeli strike in Rafah has allegedly killed 45 people including displaced people who burned alive in tents. The Israeli Prime Minister said Jerusalem was investigating Sunday night's strike in which the IDF targeted a 'terrorist compound', killing senior Hamas officials Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. Hamas claims the strike killed 45 people at a refugee centre by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a 'horrific massacre'. The IDF said earlier today that it was 'aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.' The strike came two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza 's population had sought shelter before Israel's recent incursion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its ambulance crews transported 'a large number' of people killed and injured in the strikes. The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a 'heinous massacre', accusing Israeli forces of 'deliberately targeting' the tents of displaced people. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. 'We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,' said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan. 'We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.' The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur 'in a war of such scope and intensity'. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of 'violence, property crimes and looting' were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. The attack, caught on tape by refugees on the ground, resulted in heavy destruction and flames last night. It left civilians reeling this morning, with photos showing Palestinians searching through burned out tents and makeshift camps for food. Israel's allies further condemned its methods of warfare in the region, with France saying it was 'outraged' by the violence. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,' French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. 'Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,' he told SKY TG24. Qatar , a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could 'complicate' talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas's demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a 'new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law'. Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a 'war crime '. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said this morning as EU ministers met their Arab counterparts that a ruling made by a UN court for Israel to stop its invasion of Gaza immediately must be implemented. Borrell said today: 'We have to express not only respect, but to ask for the implementation of the decision of the court. This is really a dilemma how the international community can... force implementation of the decision.' He added that EU ministers were also set to discuss relaunching a mission suspended back in 2007 to monitor the crossing after calls for it to do so from regional players including Israel. The EU's top diplomat said he expected to get a preliminary mandate from ministers to press ahead with planning for the mission. 'But it's not only us who have to decide - the Egyptians, Palestinian Israelis,' he said. 'We need to increase the number of staff and we need to have an agreement with everybody involved.' Washington has also taken a tougher line with its close ally as outrage over the war and US support for Israel has become a major issue for President Joe Biden, seeking re-election in a battle against Donald Trump. The United Nations has warned of looming famine in besieged Gaza, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. Last Monday, the prosecutor at the ICC said he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister as well as for three top Hamas figures. And on Friday, the UN's International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt any operation in Rafah that could bring about 'the physical destruction' of the Palestinians. Hamas's armed wing said Sunday that it targeted Tel Aviv 'with a large rocket barrage in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians'. 'Hamas launched these rockets from near two mosques in Rafah,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. The salvo sent people scrambling for shelter but there were no reports of injuries. Israel's army said Sunday at least eight rockets were fired towards central areas of the country from Rafah, with strikes targeting the commercial hub of Tel Aviv for the first time in months. Fighting has recently centred on Rafah, where Israel's military launched a ground operation in early May despite widespread opposition over concerns for civilians sheltering there. Netanyahu vowed to pursue Israel's offensive ahead of a war cabinet meeting amid intense diplomacy to forge a truce and a hostage-release deal. He has long rejected Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the conflict triggered by the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the war cabinet would 'discuss a hostage release deal' on Sunday. Before the meeting, Netanyahu's office said Hamas's chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, 'continues to demand the end of the war, the withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip and leaving Hamas in place, so that it will be able to carry out the atrocities of October 7 again and again'. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu strongly opposes this,' a statement said. EU members Ireland and Spain, and also Norway, have said they will recognise a Palestinian state from Tuesday, drawing furious Israeli condemnation. 'In order to make peace, we need a strong Palestinian Authority, not a weaker one,' said the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who met in Brussels with Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa. Mustafa, whose government is based in the occupied West Bank, said the 'first priority' was to support the people in Gaza, especially through a ceasefire, and then 'rebuilding the institutions of the Palestinian Authority' in the territory after Hamas seized it from the PA in 2007. The Israeli official had said Saturday that 'there is an intention to renew these talks this week' after negotiations involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators stalled in early May. Around 80 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. As the war grinds on, the families of hostages still held by militants have piled pressure on Netanyahu to secure a deal to free them. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel must take over Rafah to eliminate Hamas' remaining battalions and achieve 'total victory' over the militants, who recently regrouped in other parts of Gaza where the military has operated.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Leicester City have granted Chelsea formal permission to engage in discussions with their manager, Enzo Maresca, over the vacant head coach role at Stamford Bridge. This move comes after Chelsea identified the Italian as their leading candidate to succeed Mauricio Pochettino. On Monday, Chelsea made an official approach to Leicester, and they are now poised to hold talks with the 44-year-old manager. The discussions are expected to result in a contract spanning a minimum of five years. Leicester will receive compensation for the impending move, which is anticipated to be completed this week. Maresca joined Leicester ahead of the 2023/2024 season and promptly guided them to the Championship title, ensuring their return to the English Premier League at the first attempt. Other candidates considered for the Chelsea job included Kieran McKenna, who led Ipswich Town to promotion, and Thomas Frank, whose work at Brentford drew admiration. Chelsea initiated their search for a new head coach after the club and Pochettino mutually agreed to part ways last week, following a review of the team’s performance. The process of identifying Pochettino’s replacement has been led by co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, ultimately settling on former Manchester City assistant Maresca as their preferred option. Maresca’s credentials include working under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, where he was part of the backroom staff during the team’s treble-winning season in 2022/2023. He also worked alongside Manuel Pellegrini at West Ham United in 2018 and had a short stint with Parma in Italy’s second tier at the start of the 2021/2022 season. If the move materialises, Maresca will become the sixth manager since the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital-led takeover of Chelsea in 2022.

        "content": "President 's surprise visit to Hallie Biden's home has raised eyebrows among conservative observers who pointed out that she's expected to testify in 's federal trial in the coming weeks. Users on X, formerly , questioned why the president made a nighttime visit to his daughter-in-law's home in Delaware on Sunday, noting that his son is scheduled to stand trial on June 3. But the White House pushed back on those observations, saying that Joe made the visit because it was approaching the anniversary of . Hallie was married to Beau from 2002 until his death in 2015. She began dating Hunter in 2016 while Hunter was in the process of separating from his then-wife Kathleen Buhle. Hallie and Hunter's relationship ended in 2019. Asked if the president discussed the upcoming trial with Hallie during the visit, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told the , \"No. He visited her because of the approaching 9th anniversary of Beau's passing.\" But that didn't stop from casting suspicion about the visit. \"What's a little witness tampering between ex in-laws?\" conservative lawyer . \"What's the legal term for this? Joe Biden visits Hallie Biden days before she testifies in Hunter's gun trial,\" . , \"A FATHER'S LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS, RIGHT?\" Hallie dated Hunter at the time of and is expected to be one of a dozen witnesses to appear in the first of his two scheduled criminal trials. Hunter is also set to stand trial in Los Angeles in September on tax-related charges. The president's son was expected to take a plea deal last summer, but that agreement quickly fell apart in real time as his attorneys clashed with prosecutors over whether the deal would grant Hunter immunity in the future. He pleaded not guilty. \"Biden crime family boss uses presidential muscle to pressure witness: Joe Biden visits Hallie Biden days before she testifies in Hunter's gun trial,\" columnist . \"Nothing to see. Move along. Hey look, a flag that became the worst possible thing in the world about four days ago,\" . In the Delaware gun case, special counsel David Weiss alleges that Hunter unlawfully purchased and kept a Colt Cobra 388PL revolver for 11 days and falsely stated on a gun purchase form that he was not an unlawful drug user. Hunter has been very open about his struggle with addiction and acknowledged his addiction to crack cocaine during that period. The Delaware trial is expected to include testimony from both Hallie and Buhle. Court filings show that in November 2018, Hunter texted Hallie, \"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished.\" The special counsel's office is also expected to show materials including text messages between Hunter and his daughter, photos and videos of him smoking crack cocaine and receipts of money spent on \"various women.\" But some legal commentators believe those materials are only being used to embarrass the Biden family. \"Not sure what he is accomplishing by filing it publicly, other than perhaps prompting the witnesses to urge Biden to plead guilty,\" former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

In the episode of the said program this Monday, Chelsea was interviewed for the first time by the King of Talk, Boy Abunda. During their conversation, Boy asked Chelsea if it was true that she had planned to back out of the competition before. Chelsea Manalo replied, “I was on the verge of quitting na po dahil we have to face it Tito Boy, medyo matagal ‘yung competition this time, inabot siya ng four months.” “Ako po, I came in here as an independent wala akong resources, I didn’t have much...financial...So darating talaga sa point na mauubos ka and I was almost there to quit but because of the people who supported me.” “Magastos siya kasi ako I come back and forth to Bulacan, so siguro ‘yung transportation, dress, the makeup, everything, you have to provide it on your own,” she added.

        "content": "JENNIFER Aniston has shown off her fit figure in a new promotional ad for her favorite fitness brand, Pvolve. The Friends star got involved with the brand in 2023 which combines low-impact functional fitness with resistance-based equipment. In an ad posted on Instagram , Jen , 55, used a few exercise products in front of a brown background. The Morning Show actress rested one knee on a black padded exercise mat with her other leg stretched out while using an elastic band that hooked around her ankle. She leaned to one side while stretching her arm over her head while holding onto the other part of the band. The Just Go With It star looked onward while wearing a plunging white sports bra and high-waisted black leggings with white sneakers. \"Fitness, evolved,\" the ad read, \"Meet the innovative fitness method that will change the way you work out.\" The commercial encouraged users to check out the website and purchase the products. The A-list actress continued showing off her incredible abs to promote Pvolve. Earlier this month, Jen participated in a Spring challenge with the fitness brand. To introduce her challenge, the star showed off her fit figure in just a black sports bra and matching high-waisted leggings. She had a determined look on her face with half of her hair tied back and the other half resting on her chest. To cover up most of her top, she held onto a Pvolve exercise ball. In the comment section, fans sent nothing but praise to the star. \"Our powerful girl,\" one wrote. A second said, \"Body goals.\" \"I think it’s good to do something every single day, even if it’s just stretching, moving your body in some form, taking a walk, but a really good workout? Three to five times a week for me. \"Our biggest inspiration,\" stated someone else. \"This sounds fantastic,\" a fourth said, discussing the latest challenge. A few days earlier, Jen was featured in a video by Well+Good where she participated in a few exercises . The 55-year-old wore an all-black ensemble including a sports bra and skintight leggings to show off her stunning figure with her abs on full display. In the clip, Jen flaunted what her muscles were capable of including squats and leg lifts all while using a kettleball to add some more weight. \"What strength 'from the inside out' means to @jenniferaniston is not just focusing on superficial muscles like the six-pack, but instead working more internal layers of muscles, like the deep core,\" the brand's caption read. In a recent interview with Prevention , Jen discussed her fitness routine. \"I think I used to think ‘I have to work out every day,’\" she said. \"I think it’s good to do something every single day, even if it’s just stretching, moving your body in some form, taking a walk, but a really good workout? Three to five times a week for me.\" She also gave her advice to those wanting to start exercising, but having trouble staying motivated. \"If you’re struggling, if you find it hard, you can do anything for five minutes. Once you just get over that first hurdle of ‘I don’t want to’ it all kind of falls into place. I’m not a fitness guru. But that’s how I do it, if I’m really feeling unmotivated, say, ‘Just move at least for five minutes’ and then see where you could go.\"",

        "content": "THE US Postal Service has advised Americans to upgrade their mailboxes — and pay the price. USPS announced it wanted Americans to switch to wider, taller boxes to accommodate packages. Citing the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon , USPS said people should “consider upgrading to one of the newer larger capacity boxes.” The push came as part of what the federal agency calls “ Mailbox Improvement Week .” This happens on the third week of May each year, USPS said. Postal officials said it’s meant to “encourage customers with box-on-post-delivery to examine and, where necessary, improve the appearance of their mailboxes.” Now, that includes replacing them with “jumbo” mailboxes. The broad boxes are available at many retailers, but some cost upwards of $100. Some options listed at Home Depot sell for around $60. USPS customers have taken issue with the request. One X user shared her frustration in a tweet. “The drivers are too lazy to walk packages to the doors,” she claimed. “Infuriating!” Others replied to a tweet about the jumbo mailboxes by CBS . “Is it because they don’t want to walk up to a front door?” they asked. “Just a wild guess.” “While we do that, can they deliver the regular mail consistently?” one quipped. Another said they simply did not want a new mailbox. “I don't want to go out and buy a new mailbox,” they said. “My small one is in good shape and will do just fine.” The Postal Service has suggested several spots to get a jumbo box. The Home Depot sells boxes ranging from $60 to $300. Budget Mailboxes is offering one for $129.95, with free shipping during the month of May. Lowe's has one for $89. Walmart's is $65.79. Prices can vary by location. See the USPS website for more places to buy jumbo boxes. The USPS has advised several other box changes during this Mailbox Improvement Week. The Service says these changes can help ensure smooth delivery. The USPS came under fire last month after announcing it would raise the price of a first-class stamp. An 8% price hike will be implemented in July. Last year, the service experienced an outage just before Christmas. USPS closes on some weekdays, including one this week .",

The International Court of Justice in The Hague did in fact issue a strict decision against Israel but it didn't order a halt to the military operation in the southern Gaza Strip. Granted that the U.S. isn't satisfied with the Israel Defense Forces' operation in the city, but it's calming that Israel has managed, under threat, to evacuate about a million Palestinians from the city and there's still no American veto against entering it. But that hasn't spared another entanglement. In less than a day, dozens of Palestinian civilians were killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike and an Egyptian soldier was killed following exchanges of fire between an Israeli soldiers and the Egyptian army around the Rafah crossing area.",

        "content": "After a grueling three-setter against Karolina Muchova at the French Open last season, Aryna Sabalenka had yet again fallen at the semifinal hurdle on the Grand Slam stage. It was a frustrating afternoon which seemed to be turning into somewhat of an unwelcome pattern for the Belarusian. It marked her fifth Slam out of the last eight where she came just one match from the final. A year is a long time, though. Fast forward twelve months and she has doubled her Grand Slam tally in Melbourne and earned a runner’s-up medal at New York in the US Open . Her memories in Paris aren’t overly positive though. Last year’s semifinal was the first time in six attempts that she managed to get past Round 3. You sense though that the former World #1 has considerably grown in the last 18 months and is a different proposition to the player who used to struggle so greatly on the clay. Looking ahead to the tournament, she said on the official Roland Garros website , “I’m super happy to be back. I love playing here, and I had a couple of good results in Madrid and Rome. Feel quite confident going to Roland-Garros. I’m just super excited, as always, to start playing here. I’m focusing on myself, not own goals, but on things I have to improve and get better at so I have a chance against Iga on the clay court and especially here at Roland-Garros.“ Sabalenka has enjoyed a pretty solid clay court campaign up until now. She struggled in Stuggart losing early to Vondrousova. Although, with personal events of the court that could be understood. In Madrid, she came into her element gaining a pair of comeback wins against the in-form Danielle Collins (4-6 6-4 6-3) and Elena Rybakina (1-6 7-5 7-6). She would lose in the final to Iga Swiatek in all-time classic 7-5 4-6 7-6(7). Rome would be the real test, though. Due to the altitude of the Madrid courts, they play differently from the traditional red clay and aren’t representative of what to expect at Roland Garros. The Rome courts are a better gauge. She was excellent in Italy up until the final, losing just two sets overall against quality opponents such as Elina Svitolina, Jelena Ostapenko, and Collins. However, in the final Swiatek hammered her 6-2 6-3 proving on the clay the Pole has Sabalenka’s number. Now, we are at Roland Garros. Sabalenka’s draw is relatively fuss-free until the semifinal stage. Her probable line-up is Paula Badosa Round 3, Madison Keys Round 4, Maria Sakkari in the quarterfinal, Elena Rybakina in the semifinal, and Swiatek in the final. Up until Rybakina, you have to say that run suits her. The likes of Badosa, Keys, and Sakkari are all aggressive powerful players. They like to have time on the ball and strike it well and dictate on their own terms. Unlucky for them that’s also Sabalenka’s checkmate. We saw how Sabalenka struggled against Coco Gauff at last year’s US Open. The American played a more defensively tricky game, which ultimately frustrated Sabalenka. Elena Rybakina, of course, is the mouth-watering tie. This season they are one win apiece. However, with the fitness of the Kazakhstani unclear you would have to say Sabalenka goes into that one favorite. If she meets Swiatek that’s when it gets tough. Since winning in Madrid last season, she trails 5-1 in the previous six head-to-heads. Sabalenka’s power is unmatchable, but that becomes slightly muted on the clay courts in comparison to grass and hardcourt. Swiatek’s movement and counter-punching are the best we’ve seen in a long time and it’s that profile that Sabalenka often struggles against (see back to Coco Gauff). Sabalenka is definitely in with a shout of winning her first Roland Garros title. If Swiatek doesn’t manage, then she is the next favorite in my opinion. However, the World #1 seems invincible on the Paris clay , and it will take a massive effort and considerable improvement to knock her from her perch.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Heartfelt words marked Anthony Martial’s farewell to Manchester United on Monday evening, as the French striker confirmed his departure after nine seasons at the club. The 28-year-old, who joined United from Monaco in 2015, expressed his “great emotion” at leaving Old Trafford, thanking the “best supporters in the world” for their “unwavering support”. Martial’s time at United was marked by both success and injury setbacks. He scored 90 goals across all competitions for the Red Devils, winning the FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League, and Community Shield. However, his final appearance for the club came in December’s three-goal home defeat against Bournemouth due to recurring injury concerns. Despite signing a new five-year deal in 2019, which included an option for United to extend his stay until June 2025, the club decided against exercising that clause. Martial’s struggles with form and fitness saw him score no more than 10 goals in a season since the 2019/2020 campaign, with just two goals in five starts across all competitions this term. The Frenchman spent the second half of the 2021/2022 season on loan at Sevilla, where he found the net only once. Martial, who has earned 30 caps for France, scoring twice, expressed his gratitude to Manchester United and the fans, stating: “This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you.” Jude Obafemi is a versatile senior Correspondent at THEWILL Newspapers, excelling in sourcing, researching, and delivering sports news stories for both print and digital publications.",

        "content": "Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday in Chandauli claimed that the region of Purvanchal would deal the final blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The people of Purvanchal have made up their mind that they will support the INDIA alliance. Ever since the elections came to Purvanchal, the people of the BJP are in shock. These people in the past were raising the slogan of ‘400 paar ‘ have forgotten this slogan ever since elections have come to Purvanchal. The region will deal the final blow to the BJP,” Mr. Yadav said in Chandauli, addressing a rally in support of the SP candidate Virendra Singh. In Chandauli, the SP candidate is locked in a tough contest with BJP nominee and Union Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey. The SP president added that the INDIA alliance would scrap the Agniveer scheme for the armed forces, and restore the old pension scheme. “Your vote is crucial. Not only will our party win, you will get employment, you (people) will get a permanent job in the Army, and the number of jobs will also increase, the old pension will be restored. Our youth, who wanted a permanent job, was given a half-hearted job as an Agniveer. After June 4, when the INDIA alliance government is formed, we will work to provide permanent jobs to the youth,” Mr. Yadav said. “The BJP government, which has been in power for the last 10 years, has been governing on the basis of loot and lies. They did not work. They wasted 10 years in the Centre and seven years in U.P.,” he said.

Rafiq Ansari was arrested from the Zaidpur area of Barabanki district and produced before an MP/MLA court here which sent him to 14-day judicial custody, they said. Superintendent of Police (City) Ayush Vikram Singh said Rafiq Ansari had gone \"missing\" for the past few days and raids were being conducted to find him. Several non-bailable warrants were issued against him by the high court but he did not appear before the court, the SP said. The case against Rafiq Ansari was registered under Section 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code at Civil Lines police station here in 1995. The arrested MLA was accused of causing traffic jams and damaging property. The high court had ordered that Rafiq Ansari be arrested and produced before it. Police had formed a team to arrest the SP MLA, Singh said.

        "content": "The National Works Agency (NWA) has commenced work to rehabilitate sections of the Burnt Ground to Ramble and Mackfield to Ramble roads in Hanover at a cost of $36.5 million. This was disclosed by Community Relations Officer at the NWA's Western Office, Janel Ricketts, who indicated that the projects commenced last month and are expected to be completed by June. “The project involves extensive drainage improvement with the construction of a number of drains, including French, curb and channel drains. The work also includes the reshaping and resurfacing of the roadways using asphaltic concrete overlay,” she told JIS News. Ricketts said the current works follow the rehabilitation of another section of the Burnt Ground roadway at a cost of $17.8 million, noting that this formed phase one of programmed activities in the area. “The projects are being undertaken through the agency's Routine Road Maintenance Programme, and... will complement earlier works completed in February along another section of the Burnt Ground main road. This section of the roadway falls between the Shettlewood to Mackfield corridor, and in November of last year, work was started on that section of the road to include the removal of soft spots, reshaping sections of the roadway as well as the construction of additional drainage features,” she stated. Ricketts added that the corridor is an important one, which connects the parishes of Hanover and Westmoreland with St James, noting that citizens previously expressed dissatisfaction with the poor conditions along the corridor. “The government started from November [of last year] to upgrade particular sections of this corridor, and the works that are being undertaken now are an extension of that, in terms of having other areas along that particular stretch of roadway improved,” she further stated. - JIS News Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

It has a male-only guest policy, except in the case of events. But two keen fly fishing women have challenged the policy by publicly criticising it for being old fashioned. The Flyfishers' Club was established in 1884 and describes itself as a club for gentlemen interested in the art of fly fishing, with around 600 current members (stock photo) It is Britain's oldest fly-fishing club and even counts King Charles (pictured in 2021) as its patron King Charles is known to be a keen fisherman and took his sons on several fishing trips during the Royal Family's summer holidays in Scotland King Charles, then Prince of Wales, fishing with Prince Harry at Loch Muick on the Balmoral Estate during a family picnic in the summer of 1993 Marina Gibson, a fly fishing instructor and guide, and Lucy Mantle, the chairman and co-founder of the City Flickers fly fishing organisation, have called for the club to embrace change. Ms Gibson, who began fishing at the age of five and has written a book about her passion for fly fishing, said she would 'absolutely love' to join The Flyfishers' Club. She said during an event at the Hay Festival: 'I don't go to London that often but if I did, I would just love to go and sit and read a book and talk about fishing to other fishermen', according to The Telegraph . Ms Mantle posted an open letter to the club president on her Instagram which read: 'In light of the recent press reports on the Garrick Club, I thought the timing might be right to raise my concerns. 'I am of course aware that the club was founded in 1884 as a 'gentlemen's club for fly fishers', but it now seems increasingly anachronistic and archaic to continue to ban women given the vast societal changes that have occurred. 'There are many of us - both men and women - who view the policy as indefensible, unsustainable and, above all, unwise for a whole series of reasons.' Previous members of the club included author David Profumo, son of Sixties sex scandal Tory minister John, and TV's Loyd Grossman (stock image) King Charles fishing near Balmoral in Aberdeenshire in May, 1984 She said there was a widespread misconception that fly-fishing was for 'old fogeys' or wealthy, elderly men in the UK. She also said she was sceptical that the exclusion of women is the strongly-held position for the majority of members. In conclusion, she added: 'Most women anglers that I know have the exact same passion and knowledge of fly-fishing as many eminent current members. 'I am sure this issue has arisen on several previous occasions. But, as the Garrick experience has shown, it won't go away and momentum is building. Please help do the right thing. And yes, I would have liked to join.' Alastair Collett, president of the club, told The Telegraph the matter was under consideration and may be put to a membership vote. The matter was last discussed by the general committee in 2013 as members met on how it would deal with the Equality Act. The president of the club said the matter was under consideration and may be put to a membership vote King Charles, then the Prince of Wales, looks at a fishing magazine during a visit to Braunton in North Devon in 2012 But at the time it was not put to a vote and the men-only rule remained. Previous members of the club included author David Profumo, son of Sixties sex scandal Tory minister John, and TV's Loyd Grossman. King Charles is known to be a keen fisherman and took his sons on several fishing trips during the Royal Family's summer holidays in Scotland. The club has had several homes over its 140-year lifetime but is now based at the Savile Club in Mayfair. The row over The Flyfishers' Club membership rules is not the first issue around gender to raise its head in the fishing community recently. In 2020, the BBC Europe editor Katya Adler was ridiculed for referring to 'fisherpeople' rather than 'fishermen' during a package on Brexit talks. In 2020, the BBC Europe editor Katya Adler (pictured) was ridiculed for referring to 'fisherpeople' rather than 'fishermen' during a package on Brexit talks Critics at the time said people working in the industry on boats are overwhelmingly men, pointing to a study finding only 2.7 per cent are female. Piers Morgan railed against the use of the word and hit out at the BBC, saying on Good Morning Britain at the time: 'Here's the point, it's a rough old job, on the trawler boats on the rough high seas. 'I've never seen a woman on a trawler boat doing that.' Another row broke out last February when singer Sam Smith claimed they dreamed of becoming a 'fisher-them' on BBC's The One Show . The non-binary pop star, who uses the pronouns they/them, was asked about their fishing hobby before correcting a presenter who appeared to 'misgender' them by asking whether they would like to be a 'fly fisherman'. Ms Gibson said she was perfectly happy with the continued use of fishermen instead of fisherpeople.

The gentlemen's club landmark decision to admit women came after celebrity figures such as Stephen Fry and Sting threatened to quit the club unless the policy was changed. Top civil servant Simon Case and MI6 boss Sir Richard Moore resigned from the club after their names were published on a leaked list of members. The Garrick's 1,300 members, who include, King Charles, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden and actor Hugh Bonneville, voted the change through with 60 per cent in favour in May.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "TORONTO — Students and staff at a Toronto Jewish girls school that was the target of a shooting over the weekend are shaken but undeterred, the principal said Monday as police continue to investigate the incident. Rabbi Yaacov Vidal of the Bais Chaya Mushka Elementary School said some students were apprehensive about attending classes on Monday but everyone showed up. \"We are united, we're resilient, we're optimistic and we trust in God and we are not going to be deterred,\" Vidal said in a phone interview. Toronto police say two suspects fired shots at the school in the city's north end shortly before 5 a.m. Saturday. No one was injured, though there is damage to the building. Police have released video and images of a dark-coloured vehicle in which the suspects fled. Police say it's too early to say for sure if the shooting was hate-motivated, but politicians are condemning it as an antisemitic act. Members of the Jewish community, supporters and politicians gathered at the school Monday morning for a rally, with speakers calling for strength and solidarity. Daniel Held, chief program officer at the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto, said the rally was meant to show \"what it means to live with tolerance and peace and love for one another.\" \"(The shooting) was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire Jewish community, to make us cower and hide who we are, but as you can see here today, the attackers completely failed,\" he said. \"We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens.\" Vidal said the Bais Chaya Mushka school had never experienced an incident like this or vandalism in the past. \"We are in an industrial area. So that makes it a lot more shocking that they came to us,\" he said. \"It's not like we are in the heart of the Jewish community or anything like that.\" Vidal said the school is grateful for the funding it received through the federal government's security infrastructure program for communities at risk, which allowed for safety measures such as security film on the building's windows and a fenced perimeter. The fence was a \"huge deterrent,\" he said. \"(The gunmen) had to stand behind it, they could not enter the property. And we're grateful for that as well.\" Vidal said the school will be exploring other options to further beef up security in the aftermath of the shooting. In the meantime, he said students who are experiencing fear and anxiety are being encouraged to turn to their parents or a trusted adult. \"And if not, we are available – teachers, staff, myself – and we will definitely make sure that everyone gets the help that they need to cope with this kind of trauma,\" Vidal said. He said the school is also communicating with fearful parents, many of whom attended Monday morning's solidarity rally. Ontario Solicitor General Michael Kerzner was among the politicians who spoke at the rally. He said he is a third-generation Torontonian from a Jewish family, and that the city's Jewish community is not going anywhere. \"It's true, we are in a darker time,\" he said. \"It is true, we are subjected to unfortunate intimidation and acts of hate and antisemitism, which are completely unacceptable. And that's why we as a community must stand stronger now than ever, proud of our heritage proud of our culture.\" Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce called on everyone in the province and beyond to rally behind the Jewish community and stand up against hate. \"We stand together, we stand strong, because there is no bullet that can shatter our resolve as a country to stand up against this pernicious hate,\" he said. \"Our work will not end until every child in our province is able to go to school, and play in our streets without the fear of being attacked simply for being a Jew. The Canada we know and we love is a nation of people who come together for every faith and heritage.\" Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said the students and teachers at the school deserve to be able to attend in safety. \"This is a place for a lot of joyous learning, with young children, and a place to deepen their understanding of the Jewish culture and faith, a place to learn math, science, history,\" she said. \"I came here to tell you you are not alone. We came to say that it's important that we come together.\" Vidal said he's thankful for the community's support and hopes incidents like this will serve as a reminder that the world needs more \"acts of goodness and kindness.\" Federal Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters Monday that the RCMP are \"working collaboratively\" with Toronto police on this investigation. \"I hope very much that the community in Toronto understands that they are bringing every law enforcement tool ... to hold those responsible for this hateful and violent crime to account,\" he said.

        "content": "Canadians feel both “optimism and concern” over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks, a new report says. The Leger study commissioned by Transport Canada found residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) — drones’ larger, typically human-piloted cousins. Despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility’s potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services, the survey showed. Comfort with those three uses of the technology in urban areas hovered at around 80 per cent. Surveying, inspections _ of power lines, for example — and cargo shipment also had overwhelming support. Only transport of people, rather than things, notched below 50 per cent in favour. “If we are talking about emergencies, then it’s a no-brainer. We are going to save lives and put out fires. But when it comes to transportation, it’s a no,” one participant told the pollsters. Further concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impact and privacy tempered enthusiasm for the aerial vehicles. “The outlook on advanced air mobility (AAM) in Canada is a complex blend of optimism and concern,” the report stated. “Issues such as the safety and privacy risks associated with drone use, the environmental footprint of AAM operations and the readiness for autonomous functions are especially significant worries.” More than half of respondents had reservations around safety and potential crashes. Well over one-third pointed to security threats and privacy fears. And between a quarter and a third highlighted prices, noise pollution and the impact on the environment. The “cautious optimism” of respondents toward drones and eVTOLs underscores their perceived benefits, the authors concluded. “Yet it also sends a clear message about the necessity to tackle safety, environmental, and social issues.” In Canada, drones are deployed for tasks ranging from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions and wildfire detection. Meanwhile air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis will be cleared for the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Some manufacturers have 2025 as their target, such as Silicon Valley’s Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. The whirly machines carry the promise of delivering people and goods across congested urban and suburban areas and between nearby cities. But headwinds around technology, regulation and investment remain, with Canada lagging behind some of its peers on policy. And whether aerial vehicles can move beyond a sleek slice of the ultrarich and the medical and cargo niches in the near term remains up in the air. Last week, Boeing Co. pledged $240 million toward a Montreal-area aerospace cluster that will include advanced air mobility research pertinent to its Whisk Aero subsidiary, which makes self-flying taxis. “The expertise here in autonomy is as good as, if not better than, pretty much everywhere else in the world,” said Boeing Global president Brendan Nelson in an interview, adding that certification is on the horizon. Despite ongoing innovation in Canada, more than three-quarters of respondents to the Leger survey had never heard of advanced air mobility. Awareness was higher among Canadians aged 18-34, those with a university diploma, men and Indigenous people and people of colour, the report found. The 99-page paper was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND) says it’s collaboration with other stakeholders is leading to a sustainable peace in the Niger Delta region. Speaking after the release of the foundation’s annual report for 2023, PIND’s Executive Director, Tunji Idowu, said collaborative efforts of the organisation with other key players have led to equitable economic development. The annual report is titled “Advancing Frontiers for Greater Impact”. Idowu said about 100 service providers through the foundation’s market systems development project supported over 49,000 farmers with 46.35% of them being females. He said that collaborative efforts between farmers and MSME birthed a tremendous investment in the threshold of over N10 billion. According to him, despite the socioeconomic challenges, including rising inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations which affected purchasing power in the country, the foundation continued to exceed expectations in delivering on its mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the region. “I recall how together with our partners, [PIND] continued to find creative, people-centered ways to carry out our mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the Niger Delta. “Being a Niger-Delta-centric organisation, which started in 2010 we started out by giving out grants to other implementers, this has since evolved into a go-to resource, convener, and implementer of development programs and projects for other donors in the region. “We largely accomplished this through robust programs focused on community-driven, research-backed needs: prosperity and peace through economic growth and peacebuilding. “In 2023, PIND consolidated all the achievements from its previous and ongoing work in the Niger Delta while exploring new opportunities for improving livelihoods and ensuring lasting peace in a once conflict-ridden region,” Idowu said.",

        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron has lifted the state of emergency in New Caledonia, aiming to foster political dialogue following recent unrest. The lifting of the state of emergency in New Caledonia, imposed after violent protests, aims to create a conducive environment for dialogue between pro-independence groups and local leaders. The unrest, sparked by and changes to voting lists, is testament to the ongoing tension between Indigenous Kanaks seeking independence and those favouring continued ties with France. Macron stated that lifting the state of emergency is \"the necessary condition for the opening of concrete and serious negotiations.\" Despite the end of the state of emergency, a curfew and bans on public gatherings, transport, and the sale of alcohol remain in place. The main international airport, La Tontouta, will stay closed to commercial traffic until 2 June. Security reinforcements are being sent, with 480 additional gendarmes arriving soon. As Macron pushes for dialogue, pro-independence leaders call for continued resistance against electoral reforms. The next steps involve negotiating between the French government and New Caledonia's various factions to address the underlying issues and find a peaceful resolution. Share 2 min read",

        "content": "Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won’t face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province’s law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. “(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips’ data,” reads the letter, dated May 17. “The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service’s) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.” The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. “(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,” the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name “Mike Corps,” which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk’s offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

A new canine-only airline called BARK Air is not only getting them out - but away. The dog-only airline made it's maiden flight from New York to Los Angeles on Thursday, May 23. According to its CEO Matt Meeker, the new airline will transport dogs of all sizes and their people 'in comfort and in style,' aiming for stress-free flights for both owners and pets. 'We cater everything to the dog, trying to lower their anxiety and their stress,' he explained in a press preview. 'It's a first-class experience for the dog, a business-class experience for people.' The dog-only airline made it's maiden flight from New York to Los Angeles on Thursday, May 23 According to its CEO Matt Meeker, the new airline will transport dogs of all sizes and their people 'in comfort and in style,' aiming for stress-free flights for both owners and pets BARK, the pet company founded in 2011, announced the launch of the dog-centered plane experience in April as a way 'to revolutionize flying for dogs.' The furry passengers fly better than most humans, with amenities on board including a lounge filled with treats and toys, speedy check-ins, and even an on-board spa for pups. The luxury aircraft can accommodate up to 14 people, however the airlines doesn't want to sell more than 10 tickets to make room for 10 dogs. At the moment, BARK Air offers routes between metro areas in New York City from White Plains Airport to Los Angeles's Van Nuys Airport. Internationally they fly to London's Biggin Hill Airport. The flight will set a pet and their human companion back $8,000 for a one-way international flight and $6,000 for a domestic trip. Children are not allowed to fly BARK Air and all human passengers must be at least 18 years old. However Meeker said the figures could change as the flights gained popularity.

'And that means serving as many routes as we can, making the costs more affordable, more attainable for every family or most families.' The airline is so far popular, with BARK Air receiving more than 15,000 requests for new destinations. They're now considering adding flights to Paris, Milan, Chicago, Seattle, and seasonal destinations in Florida and Arizona. 'We've got a long way to go, but this is step one,' the CEO pointed out. He added: 'Just to make it that everyone can travel with their entire family and not leave one behind.'

        "description": "Shohei Ohtani can't pitch for the Dodgers this season, but he could potentially achieve more at the plate this season than he did in his MVP seasons.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Nine months since his last time atop a big league mound, there is one thing about pitching Shohei Ohtani misses most. The nerves. “There’s a distinct nervousness on start days,” Ohtani said in Japanese on Monday , after updating reporters on the latest in his progression back from his second Tommy John surgery last year. “I think that’s the same for everyone,” he added. “There’s a nervousness. So if I have to say whether I miss it — I miss it.” For now, it’s a feeling Ohtani will have to continue to do without. In his first year with the Dodgers , he has faced plenty of other pressure over the season’s first couple of months. Dodgers The Dodgers’ three-game series against the New York Mets at Citi Field will now start with a doubleheader Tuesday after Monday’s game was postponed. As a hitter, Ohtani has thus far delivered on the expectations that came with his staggering $700 million offseason contract . Entering Monday, he was leading the majors in batting average (.336), the National League in slugging percentage (.621) and OPS (1.024), and was emerging as an early-season MVP frontrunner, with only teammate Mookie Betts holding shorter betting odds currently. Off the field, the two-way star has also navigated the gambling and theft scandal involving his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara — a situation that remains a topic of questioning in Ohtani’s sporadic media availabilities. “I don’t think the mental side affects my play,” Ohtani said. “I think that as long as you have solid technique, you can hit regardless of your mental state. I want to separate that [off-the-field problems] from what I have to do on the field. In recent weeks, Ohtani has played through a couple minor injuries, too. Dodgers Shohei Ohtani is off to his best two-month start during his MLB career. A look at how he has managed to do it with great expectations and off-field distractions. May 18, 2024 Earlier this month, he was battling back tightness that forced him to miss one game. Then, last week, he was hit in the back of the leg by a pickoff throw at first base, resulting in a right hamstring contusion that has limited his ability to run full speed on the bases. Manager Dave Roberts said over the weekend that Ohtani is playing at about 90% physically right now, though Ohtani noted Monday that his hamstring is “getting better day by day” and hasn’t been impacting his swing. “I think the condition is improving,” Ohtani said. “I don’t feel my pivot foot has been affected much [in my swing].” Still, pitching has been the missing piece of Ohtani’s season so far, with the two-time MVP remaining limited to moderate-intensity catch play of about 60-70 throws every other day. Ohtani hit a milestone last week, clocking 80 mph in his flat-ground throwing drills from 60 feet. But, with Ohtani not expected to complete his recovery as a pitcher until next season, he said he’d “like to take [the progression] step by step, and take the next step without any feeling of panic.” There could, of course, be a silver lining to Ohtani’s inability to pitch this year. Entering the season, some Dodgers officials and industry evaluators believed that , as a designated hitter only, Ohtani could achieve even more production at the plate than he did during his final three seasons in Anaheim, when he was twice an MVP winner. So far, Ohtani’s hot start has given that dynamic increasing credence. The 29-year-old is not only holding career-highs in batting average, slugging percentage and OPS, but is also setting personal bests in underlying metrics such as average exit velocity (94.8 mph), hard-hit percentage (he is hitting 59.3% of his batted balls more than 95 mph) and strikeout rate (19.2%, by far a career low). Plus, he has become more of a stolen base threat, tied for eighth in the majors with 13 steals already. So, is Ohtani’s ability to devote more focus to just the offensive side of his game leading to better results? The player wasn’t ready to decide Monday. “Until I finish the season,” Ohtani said, “it’s something I can’t say.” When posed the same question last week, Roberts gave a more insightful answer. While the manager acknowledged his personal belief that Ohtani’s singular role has bolstered his performance, Roberts also emphasized the team’s plan to use Ohtani as a two-way player again next year. California Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has paid $7.85 million for a modern mansion in the foothill city of La Cañada Flintridge, real estate records show. May 22, 2024 “Hopefully, when he’s pitching next year, he can mirror somewhat what he’s doing offensively,” Roberts said. “But I think there’s something to just, the kind of focus on the one aspect of the game.” So far this season, that’s been fine for the Dodgers. Even without Ohtani on the mound, their starting rotation has been a strength, currently ranking eighth in the majors with a 3.54 ERA. Even with his thunderous bat in the lineup, their offense has been a bigger area of recent concern, going cold during the team’s current five-game losing streak and 7-9 slide in their last 16 games overall — a stretch in which they’ve averaged only 3.5 runs per game. Ohtani has been part of the problem lately, batting just .211 over his last 10 games. But given his gaudy overall numbers, his offensive impact on this year’s team remains monstrous. A return to pitching — and reacquaintance with the pre-start nerves Ohtani has come to miss this year — will have to continue to wait.",

        "content": "Las Vegas Raiders star edge-rusher Maxx Crosby has been assembling an impressive resume five years into his NFL career. However, that elusive First Team All-Pro designation continues to evade No. 98. Is 2024 the year he finally breaks through? Ever since Crosby’s memorable rookie campaign (10 sacks, 16 tackles for a loss, and four forced fumbles), the Eastern Michigan disciple has been on a tear. The three-time Pro Bowler is easily the face of the franchise now—general manager Tom Telesco reaffirmed that notion with his recent contract restructuring. The accolades are also piling up; Crosby has seen 2nd and 1st team designations from Pro Football Focus, Sporting News, and the Pro Football Writers of America. The one honor that’s not been bestowed upon “The Condor” is the AP’s 1st Team . He’s been in the Top 10 for sacks in the entire league the last two seasons, with 12.5 and 14.5, respectively. PFF has consistently graded him near the top of all defensive categories. For example, he’s had a grade of 90.0 or better each of the last three years. Missing out on the elusive title of First Team All-Pro isn’t due to a lack of effort. The numbers speak for themselves at this point. Recently, Bleacher Report validated this idea, identifying Crosby as one of six league players poised to take that next step. “With more financial security and a strong offseason under his belt, Crosby will be in the running to lead the league in sacks and finally break through as a first-team All-Pro superstar.” Adding Christian Wilkins could lead to a special year from Maxx Crosby Despite playing at a consistently high level, Crosby has largely done everything on his own. 2023 marked a turning point, however. The emergence of Malcolm Koonce, opposite Crosby, has given the Raiders a potential lethal duo in the edge position. Missing a true disruptive force inside has also hindered Crosby. Well, the Raiders finally addressed that when they splurged on free agency, signing Christian Wilkins to a four-year contract. With nine sacks (and 30 pressures, according to Pro Football Reference) to his credit last season in Miami, Wilkins could end up becoming the difference-maker that helps Crosby reach that next plateau—perhaps he’ll finally get the respect that many refuse to give him. Thoughts, Raider Nation? Is this the year that Maxx Crosby gets that elite award? This article first appeared on The Raider Ramble and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "TOWNSHIP OF ELBA, Wis. — Four teens are dead and another is in serious condition after a crash involving a pick-up truck and semi-tractor on a highway in Dodge County early Monday morning. According to a press release from the Dodge County Sheriff's Office (DCSO), the crash happened around 4 a.m. on State Highway 16/60 at the intersection of County Road TT in the township of Elba, about three miles east of Columbus. According to an initial investigation, a Ford F150 failed to stop at a stop sign on County Highway TT at State 16/60. That's when the DCSO says a semi-tractor without a trailer struck the car. Three of the five occupants in the Ford were pronounced dead at the scene, including a 17-year-old boy, and a 19-year-old man, the driver, both from Sun Prairie. A 16-year-old teen boy from Madison was also pronounced dead at the scene. An 18-year-old woman also a passenger of the Ford, later died at UW Hospital. Another 18-year-old woman, also a passenger of the Ford, was taken to UW Madison Hospital with life-threatening injuries. The driver of the semi-tractor, a 57-year-old man from La Farge Wisconsin, was taken to Prairie Ridge Hospital in Columbus with minor injuries. The crash remains under investigation by the County Sheriff’s Office Crash Investigation Team. Assisting at the scene was the Beaver Dam Paramedics, Columbus Fire Department, Life Star EMS, Dodge County Emergency Response Team, the Dodge County Medical Examiner’s Office, and the Dodge County Sheriff Chaplains. //",

        "content": "Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks, a new report says. The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada found residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) — drones' larger, typically human-piloted cousins. Despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services, the survey showed. Comfort with those three uses of the technology in urban areas hovered at around 80 per cent. Surveying, inspections — of power lines, for example — and cargo shipment also had overwhelming support. Only transport of people, rather than things, notched below 50 per cent in favour. “If we are talking about emergencies, then it’s a no-brainer. We are going to save lives and put out fires. But when it comes to transportation, it’s a no,” one participant told the pollsters. Further concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impact and privacy tempered enthusiasm for the aerial vehicles. \"The outlook on advanced air mobility (AAM) in Canada is a complex blend of optimism and concern,\" the report stated. \"Issues such as the safety and privacy risks associated with drone use, the environmental footprint of AAM operations and the readiness for autonomous functions are especially significant worries.\" More than half of respondents had reservations around safety and potential crashes. Well over one-third pointed to security threats and privacy fears. And between a quarter and a third highlighted prices, noise pollution and the impact on the environment. The \"cautious optimism\" of respondents toward drones and eVTOLs underscores their perceived benefits, the authors concluded. \"Yet it also sends a clear message about the necessity to tackle safety, environmental, and social issues.\" In Canada, drones are deployed for tasks ranging from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions and wildfire detection. Meanwhile air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis will be cleared for the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Some manufacturers have 2025 as their target, such as Silicon Valley's Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. The whirly machines carry the promise of delivering people and goods across congested urban and suburban areas and between nearby cities. But headwinds around technology, regulation and investment remain, with Canada lagging behind some of its peers on policy. And whether aerial vehicles can move beyond a sleek slice of the ultrarich and the medical and cargo niches in the near term remains up in the air. Last week, Boeing Co. pledged $240 million toward a Montreal-area aerospace cluster that will include advanced air mobility research pertinent to its Whisk Aero subsidiary, which makes self-flying taxis. \"The expertise here in autonomy is as good as, if not better than, pretty much everywhere else in the world,\" said Boeing Global president Brendan Nelson in an interview, adding that certification is on the horizon. Despite ongoing innovation in Canada, more than three-quarters of respondents to the Léger survey had never heard of advanced air mobility. Awareness was higher among Canadians aged 18-34, those with a university diploma, men and Indigenous people and people of colour, the report found. The 99-page paper was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press",

        "description": "The UCLA athletics department is mourning the loss of the legendary Bill Walton, who led the men's basketball program to back-to-back national titles in 1972 and 1973.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES — The UCLA men’s basketball team and athletics department are mourning the loss of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, who died at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton, a UCLA basketball icon, led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, with two straight 30-0 records, which was part of the program’s historic span of seven consecutive NCAA championships from 1967 to 1973, under legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. Walton still stands No. 1 on UCLA’s career rebounding list at 1,370 and was three-time Naismith College Player of the Year and Academic All-American during his three years on varsity (1972-74). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA men’s basketball coach Mick Cronin said. “My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” The San Diego native, who attended Helix High School, was Coach Wooden’s starting center for three seasons (1971-74). In his three varsity seasons, Walton never lost a game at Pauley Pavilion (49-0). He was a consensus first-team All-America selection in all three varsity seasons, as freshmen were not allowed to play varsity when enrolled at UCLA in 1970. Walton, a UCLA Athletics Hall of Famer since 1984, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, six years after his NBA career that spanned from 1974-1987 ended. The college basketball star was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and helped lead them to the 1977 NBA championship and was named the NBA MVP in 1978. He battled injuries in his professional career. After leaving Portland, he played for the San Diego Clippers and the Los Angeles Clippers, before retiring with the Boston Celtics, where he helped win the 1986 NBA championship. “We are stunned and saddened about the news of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said. “Bill represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear and embodied multiple traits on Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of Success. “He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.” Walton’s No. 32 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s No. 33 (known in college as Lew Alcindor) became the first two UCLA men’s basketball players to have their jersey numbers retired on Feb. 3, 1990. Since then, UCLA has retired the jersey numbers of 10 former men’s basketball players. Walton, who passed surrounded by family, is survived by his wife of 33 years, Lori; his four sons, Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris; and his three grandchildren, Olivia, Avery Rose and Chase.

        "description": "The UCLA athletics department is mourning the loss of the legendary Bill Walton, who led the men's basketball program to back-to-back national titles in 1972 and 1973.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES — The UCLA men’s basketball team and athletics department are mourning the loss of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, who died at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton, a UCLA basketball icon, led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, with two straight 30-0 records, which was part of the program’s historic span of seven consecutive NCAA championships from 1967 to 1973, under legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. Walton still stands No. 1 on UCLA’s career rebounding list at 1,370 and was three-time Naismith College Player of the Year and Academic All-American during his three years on varsity (1972-74). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA men’s basketball coach Mick Cronin said. “My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” The San Diego native, who attended Helix High School, was Coach Wooden’s starting center for three seasons (1971-74). In his three varsity seasons, Walton never lost a game at Pauley Pavilion (49-0). He was a consensus first-team All-America selection in all three varsity seasons, as freshmen were not allowed to play varsity when enrolled at UCLA in 1970. Walton, a UCLA Athletics Hall of Famer since 1984, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, six years after his NBA career that spanned from 1974-1987 ended. The college basketball star was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and helped lead them to the 1977 NBA championship and was named the NBA MVP in 1978. He battled injuries in his professional career. After leaving Portland, he played for the San Diego Clippers and the Los Angeles Clippers, before retiring with the Boston Celtics, where he helped win the 1986 NBA championship. “We are stunned and saddened about the news of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said. “Bill represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear and embodied multiple traits on Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of Success. “He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.” Walton’s No. 32 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s No. 33 (known in college as Lew Alcindor) became the first two UCLA men’s basketball players to have their jersey numbers retired on Feb. 3, 1990. Since then, UCLA has retired the jersey numbers of 10 former men’s basketball players. Walton, who passed surrounded by family, is survived by his wife of 33 years, Lori; his four sons, Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris; and his three grandchildren, Olivia, Avery Rose and Chase.

        "content": "A recent study by Lund University in Sweden has shed light on a potential link between tattoos and lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The research, while preliminary, suggests that individuals with tattoos may have a slightly elevated risk of developing lymphoma compared to those without. The study followed a large group of people in Sweden, analyzing their medical history and tattoo status. Researchers found a 21% increased risk of lymphoma among those with tattoos. It’s important to note that lymphoma is a relatively rare cancer, and even with this increase, the overall risk for tattooed individuals remains low. The researchers emphasized that their findings highlight an area requiring further investigation. They acknowledge that more studies are needed to confirm the association and pinpoint the underlying cause. One hypothesis suggests that tattoo ink particles might trigger an immune response, potentially influencing lymphoma development. The body’s immune system naturally targets foreign substances, and tattoo ink, when deposited into the skin, could be perceived as such. Another possibility researchers are exploring is the link between tattooing practices and hygiene standards. While tattoo regulations and safety measures have significantly improved in recent times, some older tattoos or those applied in unsanitary conditions could pose a higher risk of infection. Certain infections have been linked to an increased risk of lymphoma. The study underscores the importance of prioritizing safety during the tattooing process. Opting for reputable tattoo parlors that adhere to strict hygiene protocols and using sterilized equipment are crucial for minimizing health risks. While the findings of this study have generated interest, it’s vital to maintain perspective. The absolute risk of lymphoma for tattooed individuals remains low. However, the research paves the way for further exploration into the long-term health effects of tattoos and emphasizes the significance of safe tattooing practices.",

        "content": "With high inflation eating into your pocket, one can look to earn a stable passive income to overcome the impact. Investing in high-yielding would be one of the cheaper and convenient ways to earn passive income. Meanwhile, you can earn a passive income of over $2,000 annually by investing $9,000 in each of the following three high-yielding dividend stocks. TC Energy ( ) operates a diversified utility-like business, with around 97% of its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) generated from rate regulation and long-term contracts. Thus, its cash flows are less susceptible to economic fluctuations, allowing it to raise dividends at an annualized rate of 7% since 2000. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.96/share, with its forward yield at 7.32%. Meanwhile, the company expects to make a capital investment of $8-$8.5 billion this year and is confident of putting $7 billion of projects into service. Further, the company’s management expects to make capital expenditure of $6-$7 billion annually after 2024. It also focuses on divesting non-core assets, which could strengthen its balance sheet. The company’s management hopes to generate $3 billion through asset sales this year, which could help lower its debt levels. Given its healthy growth prospects and improving financial position, TRP’s management is confident of raising its dividends by 3-5% annually for the next three years. BCE Over the last two years, the telecom sector has been under pressure due to rising interest rates and unfavourable regulatory decisions. Despite the near-term weakness, the sector’s growth prospects look healthy, given the growing demand amid digitization and remote working and learning. So, I have chosen ( ), one of the three top Canadian telecom players, as my second pick. It has lost around 26% of its stock value compared to its 52-week high, with its NTM (next 12 months) declining to 13. Meanwhile, BCE is expanding its 5G infrastructure, which could increase its customer base. The company and its peers are working with regulatory authorities to derive a middle ground that could retain competition without disincentivizing companies that have made substantial capital investments in expanding broadband infrastructure. Further, interest rates could eventually fall, thus helping the company to lower its interest expenses. Notably, the recent correction has increased its dividend yield to 8.7%, making it an attractive buy. NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT ( ) is another high-yielding dividend stock to have in your portfolio due to its defensive healthcare portfolio, long-term lease agreements, and inflation-indexed rent. After two tough years, the company has witnessed healthy buying over the last few weeks amid an improvement in its financial position and operating metrics. Over the last four quarters, NorthWest Healthcare has sold 27 properties, generating $696 million. It utilized these net proceeds to pay off debt with higher interest rates, thus improving its financial health. Further, its occupancy and collection rates in the first quarter stood at 96.5% and 98%, respectively. The aging population could increase healthcare demand, thus benefiting the company. So, I believe NorhtWest Healthcare is well-positioned to continue paying dividends at a healthier rate. Its of $0.03/share translates to a forward yield of 7.1%.",

        "description": "While it's true that Cameco stock (TSX:CCO) looks like a strong clean energy solution, it's not actually even a renewable energy stock.The post Is Cameco Stock the Best Renewable Energy Stock for You? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "When it comes to market gainers this year, ( ) has been one of the top choices. The uranium producer has seen shares climb even as other companies see their prices slump. However, that was then, and this is now. And now, some renewable energy stocks are coming back. So, with that in mind, is Cameco stock really the best renewable energy stock for your portfolio? The bull side Cameco stock is considered a strong investment in renewable energy for a variety of reasons. Nuclear energy is recognized as a key player in the transition to a low-carbon future. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power generates electricity without emitting greenhouse gases during operation, making it a critical component in the fight against climate change. Cameco stock is one of the largest producers of uranium, which is essential for nuclear power generation. Furthermore, it is a leading company in the uranium mining sector, with significant expertise and long-term contracts with utilities around the world. Its established market presence and experience provide a competitive edge. It even operates some of the world’s largest and highest-grade uranium mines. What’s more, Cameco has a strong balance sheet and prudent financial management, which are critical for navigating the cyclical nature of the uranium market. The company has a history of maintaining liquidity and controlling costs effectively. And with the addition of its Westinghouse operations, it looks like this should continue for at least the next several years. However, there could be some reasons why investors may want to be a bit wary or at least consider other renewable energy investments. The bear case There are a few reasons to consider Cameco stock as less of a long-term buy and more for the next few years. Despite being a low-carbon energy source, nuclear power is often not classified as “renewable energy” because it relies on uranium, a finite resource. Many investors looking to invest in renewable energy prefer companies involved in truly renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, which utilize inexhaustible resources. Plus, as we’ve seen in the past, public perception of nuclear energy can be negative due to concerns over nuclear accidents, radioactive waste disposal, and the potential for catastrophic failures, which can deter some investors. This could cause a sudden drop in share price even overnight. What’s more, the nuclear industry is heavily regulated, and changes in government policies, particularly in response to public opinion or environmental movements, can impact the industry significantly. Countries may shift away from nuclear power due to safety concerns or political pressures, as seen in Germany’s phase-out of nuclear energy post-Fukushima. Then there are the basics. The management of nuclear waste is a significant challenge. High-level radioactive waste requires secure, long-term storage solutions that are not only costly but also face strong public opposition and regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, the price of uranium is volatile. Cameco’s financial performance is closely tied to the price of uranium, which can be highly volatile due to factors such as geopolitical events, supply disruptions, and changes in demand. This dependency can result in fluctuating revenues and profits, adding an element of risk for investors. Bottom line So, while Cameco has a pivotal role in the nuclear , its alignment with the broader category of renewable energy investments is debatable. Investors focused strictly on renewable energy might find companies involved in solar, wind, or other renewable technologies more aligned with their investment goals due to fewer regulatory risks, more favourable public perception, and true renewability of the energy sources. In the end, it all comes down to your own investment portfolio and risk profile.",

The government expressed concerns about Guo’s supporters, while Guo, a sharp critic of the Chinese government, says it’s the Communist Party that poses the threat. Investors spent more than $US400 million buying stock in social media platform GTV Media Group through an allegedly illegal private stock offering, the US says. Guo skimmed $US100 million off the top and placed it in a Kyle Bass hedge fund for a high-risk bet against the Hong Kong dollar, the government says. The wager led to a $US30 million loss. Guo was an associate of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The next alleged scam was G Clubs, an exclusive private members club with a minimum $US10,000 buy-in. Investors were told the membership could earn them stock in GTV and other perks, including a discount at G Fashion, “which sold expensive clothing to the defendant’s followers,” according to the government. In his statement to the jury, Fergenson rattled off a list of Guo’s more extravagant purchases, including a Lamborghini worth almost $US1 million, a $US4 million Ferrari for his son, even a $US35,000 mattress. The US claims he bought these assets with investor funds. Fergenson also cited “an $US800 pair of sweatpants” Guo sold through his fashion brand. But his lawyer told the jury that Guo, one of eight children in a family that amassed a fortune in Chinese real estate, lived that life long before he was alleged to have committed these crimes. “The government would like you to draw many negative inferences about a person who spends thousands on a TV or a mattress,” Shroff said, urging the jurors to put the indulgences in context. Guo had devoted his life to a whistleblower movement, Shroff said, and it came at a cost. His phones and computers had been hacked by the Communist Party, his wife and daughter had been detained for two years in China, and he had an Interpol arrest notice against his name, she said. The party had also deposited money into Guo’s bank accounts under the names of people subject to US sanctions, triggering banks to close his accounts, she said. The Chinese Communist Party “had a thousand different ways to mess with Guo and stop a political movement that was really the essence of his entire being,” Shroff told the jury. Guo, who applied for asylum in the US in 2017, also forged ties to former president Donald Trump’s inner-circle. When former Trump campaign chairman Bannon was arrested for fraud in 2020, he was on board Guo’s 150-foot “Lady May” yacht off the Connecticut coast. Since his arrest at his $US67.5 million penthouse in the Sherry-Netherland hotel in March 2023, Guo’s court appearances have attracted a steady throng of supporters and detractors.

        "description": "Outspoken Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who has ties to former president Donald Trump’s inner-circle, is accused of orchestrating a complex fraud.",
        "content": "Exiled Chinese tycoon Guo Wengui likes the finer things in life, like superyachts and custom-made Italian suits, but that isn’t against the law, his lawyer told the jury in his billion-dollar fraud and racketeering trial. Being “shallow or rich does not make for a criminal,” defence attorney Sabrina Shroff said in her opening statement Friday at Guo’s trial in New York. Guo Wengui is accused of tricking investors into handing over $US1 billion for what they thought were promising investment opportunities. Credit: Reuters The case involves the intriguing background and wealth of a businessman who amassed a strong online following criticising the Chinese Communist Party and was an associate of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Also known as Miles Guo and Ho Wan Kwok, he is accused of stealing more than $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) from investors after tricking them into funding four bogus schemes. He has pleaded not guilty to 11 charges. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan allege that Guo, who referred to himself as “Brother Seven” in online videos before his arrest in March 2023, spent the funds on lavish gifts for himself and his family, including a $US26 million New Jersey mansion, a $US37 million yacht and a $US60,000 TV. Kicking off the openings, Assistant US Attorney Micah Fergenson told the jury Guo gained popularity showing off his wealth and speaking out against the Chinese leadership, provoking it to seize his assets. Short of cash, Guo embarked on a fraud spree, turning to his loyal support base to invest millions in a crypto scheme, an exclusive members-only club, a social media platform and a farm loan program between 2018 and 2023, the US claims. “The defendant’s followers trusted him,” Fergenson told the jurors. “And money poured in.” US District Judge Analisa Torres has taken the unusual step of ordering that the jury be anonymous and be escorted to the courthouse by US Marshals each day. The government expressed concerns about Guo’s supporters, while Guo, a sharp critic of the Chinese government, says it’s the Communist Party that poses the threat. Investors spent more than $US400 million buying stock in social media platform GTV Media Group through an allegedly illegal private stock offering, the US says. Guo skimmed $US100 million off the top and placed it in a Kyle Bass hedge fund for a high-risk bet against the Hong Kong dollar, the government says. The wager led to a $US30 million loss. Guo was an associate of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The next alleged scam was G Clubs, an exclusive private members club with a minimum $US10,000 buy-in. Investors were told the membership could earn them stock in GTV and other perks, including a discount at G Fashion, “which sold expensive clothing to the defendant’s followers,” according to the government. In his statement to the jury, Fergenson rattled off a list of Guo’s more extravagant purchases, including a Lamborghini worth almost $US1 million, a $US4 million Ferrari for his son, even a $US35,000 mattress. The US claims he bought these assets with investor funds. Fergenson also cited “an $US800 pair of sweatpants” Guo sold through his fashion brand. But his lawyer told the jury that Guo, one of eight children in a family that amassed a fortune in Chinese real estate, lived that life long before he was alleged to have committed these crimes. “The government would like you to draw many negative inferences about a person who spends thousands on a TV or a mattress,” Shroff said, urging the jurors to put the indulgences in context. Guo had devoted his life to a whistleblower movement, Shroff said, and it came at a cost.

        "description": "A backwards glance at the hundreds and thousands of lives lost in military service to conflicts dating back to the civil war",
        "content": "Memorial Day in downtown Washington has an eerie feel: the normally bustling Connecticut Avenue, which dissects the city on its route past the White House, has a sleepy Sunday vibe but something is off: too many low-flying aircraft in the sky, too many siren bursts and the tail-end of the tornadoes ripping through the central states is in the swirling breeze. Down at the Vietnam Wall, a black granite curved memorial bearing the names of 58,000 US military people killed in that war, the crowd is gathering for a lunchtime service. The mood is of hushed reunion and observance. It’s just one of countless acts of parades and pageantry taking place across the country. “I was here in 1982 when it opened,” says Gary Galloway, a 75-year-old veteran from Hardinsburg, Kentucky, who served in Vietnam in 1969-1970. “I have been here for the last 15 years every Memorial Day and Veterans Day. I’ve four guys on the wall there. And I know a lot of others on the wall. I had eight months in Vietnam. I got messed up over there. I was 21. I was one of the older guys.” READ MORE Amid rising animosity, Macron honours Nazi-hunting couple in Germany Memorial Day at Arlington: A mood of hushed reunion and observance ‘I’ve changed this party, permanently’: Keir Starmer promises red renewal in Tory party’s blue backyard It could be described as the US’s strangest day: the official beginning of summer, with attendant larks and beach plans, but it is also a sombre and solemn backwards glance at the hundreds and thousands of lives lost in military service to conflicts dating back to the civil war from 1861 to 1865 that shattered the idea of the United States. On a Sunday of searing heat, a steady crowd had lined in the tree-shaded approach to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers, which sits on a crest in Arlington Cemetery. It’s the only day of the year when the public are permitted to walk across the plaza where the crypts hold bodies of unidentified soldiers disinterred from distant graves and transferred to the memorial, each representing unknown soldiers from the first and second World Wars, and the Korean and Vietnam wars. In 1998 the Unknown American from the Vietnam era was exhumed from the tomb and, using newly available science, was identified as a first lieutenant in the US air force named Michael J Blassie: he was then laid to rest in Missouri in accordance with his family’s wishes. But Arlington has more than 4,000 headstones marked “Unknown”. When the former estate and home to Robert E Lee, who resigned from the US army and became the commander of the Confederate army and the shimmering figure of the South’s Lost Cause mythology, was repurposed as a burial ground, the original graves were marked with white wooden clapboards. Early visitors described how, when walking up to Arlington, the entire scene looked like fields of white flowers. In time, marble replaced the boards, but the effect remains the same. A monument in what was the rose garden of Arlington House marks the location where the remains of 2,111 soldiers gathered after the Battle of Bull Run at Manassas. Arlington House itself is open to the public and the only change to the interior, preserved since the day Lee hurriedly departed, are electric fans rotating to cool the stream of visitors filing through and taking photographs of the actual red velvet furniture set bought by Lee, of the table where the family set still laid. More than 400,000 people are buried at Arlington in 70 sections which are oddly haphazard in layout. Section 13 is where the white civil war dead are buried. Section 27 was reserved for African-American union soldiers. A short walk away is section 60, where most of those buried were born in the 1990s. Of course, not all died in combat. A family relative, my mother’s uncle, Martin Sweeney, who left Connemara as a young man, joined the US army and served in the second World War and Korea, was buried in section 67 in the winter of 1984. As military lives go, his was blessed: he lived until old age. It’s a disorientating place, Arlington, with its prevailing peacefulness (birdsong like the Masters golf tournament) and dignity and the heavy mystique of the big house on the hill framed by the overwhelming, inescapable deluge of violence and death beneath it all. The civil war has become the framework around which the US’s narrative is told. The World Wars are revered as the good wars. But the more recent conflicts in Vietnam and the Gulf and the mismanaged invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan generate complex and conflicting emotions. “How do you memorialise the dead of a failed war?” asked Phil Klay, the novelist who served in the marine corps in Iraq in a New York Times essay this week. “At Arlington, it’s easy to let your heart swell with pride as you pass certain graves. Here are the heroes who ended slavery. Here are the patriots who defeated fascism. We think of them as inextricably bound up with the cause they gave their life to. The same can’t be said for more morally troubling wars, from the Philippines to Vietnam. And for the dead of my generation’s wars, for the dead I knew, the reasons they died sit awkwardly alongside the honour I owe them.” The names on the Vietnam Wall are limited to those who either died in the conflict or, within 120 days, of injuries or illnesses inflicted by time in the combat zone. That limited window has caused its own controversies, raised its own questions about the unnumbered who suffered health problems in later life. One of the most disquieting statistics about the aftershocks of the US military life concerns later-life suicide: in 2020, more than 6,100 veterans took their own lives – and that figure marked a decrease on preceding years. Many others continue to suffer the after-effects of Agent Orange, including Gary Galloway, who has been diagnosed with cancer. His way of dealing with it is to keep going: he’s an avid motor biker and tries to walk 8km each day. “I don’t have PTSD. I think the reason I don’t is that I stay active. I knew a guy from home who was in the second World War, at Iowa Jima. A marine. He was 90 years old. He had a Mustang convertible. He travelled all over the country. I said: ‘Why do you do that?’ He said: ‘If I slow down, the shellshock is going to hit me.’” At Arlington on Monday morning, president Joe Biden invoked the name of William Christman, a Pennsylvanian who became the first soldier buried there in June of 1864, seven weeks after enlisting. He was not alone for long. Like many presidents before him, Biden’s address was cloaked in the language of military myth. His sentiments were genuine but sit uneasily in a year when the US government is sponsoring Israel’s ongoing slaughter in Palestine. “One thing I see that’s changed here: all school kids who came here, they would hand you letters and greet you,” Gary Galloway says as a light rain begins to spit and the umbrellas are raised before the ceremony at the Vietnam Memorial Wall. “I’m not seeing that so much any more. Just every once in a while some young kid will say thank you for your service. But that’s it. I don’t have any idea why that is. Everything has changed.” Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Find The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Our In The News podcast is now published daily – Find the latest episode here",

        "content": "The Massachusetts knifeman accused of stabbing six people, including three children, and suspected of killing another, appears to have been in the process of changing their identity. Jared Ravizza, 26, swapped shirtless selfies showing off a gym-honed torso as recently as September 2023 for ones wearing lipgloss, face glitter and painted pink nails. Ravizza also describes themselves as “she” on Instagram and court documents obtained by The Post show paperwork was filed for a legal name change from Jared Christian Ravizza Jones to Jared Love Jones just last month. In the application, Ravizza wrote the reason as: “Honoring my beloved grandmother Priscilla Jones,” and “honoring the creative brilliance and magical beauty of my entire Jones family lineage,” on their maternal side. Ravizza also asked the name change not be made public because “this has been a deeply personal journey for me,” in the papers dated April 8. The request was granted and signed off on by a judge the following day. Ravizza is being investigated over a murder in Connecticut after cops found a body in the tiny town of Deep River around 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to Boston 25 news . The identity of the victim has not been revealed. Ravizza is then accused of laughing as he stabbed four little girls aged between 9 and 17 as they watched the movie “IF” at a theater outside Boston — then attacking two other people at a McDonald’s, according to cops. None of the victims’ injuries were life-threatening and they were treated at a hospital, according to local reports. The alleged attacker’s Instagram page shows dozens of images and videos where they are wearing large sunglasses, posing in model-esque fashion and displaying artwork. In some of the images, Ravizza poses with a black Porsche which appears to be the same one crashed in a police pursuit following the stabbing frenzy over the weekend. One video posted just two weeks ago shows Ravizza walking up to the car and creepily looking back at the camera. On April 5 Ravizza posed a series of pictures with artwork, a pipe for smoking and a dollar bill. Five days later Ravizza posted a photo pointing to a hand-drawn picture of their new name surrounded by pink hearts on his Instagram page. The Plymouth County District Attorney said Sunday Ravizza is facing counts of assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after the attack on the girls at Braintree AMC and then an attack on two employees at a Plymouth McDonald’s an hour away. Ravizza has yet to enter a plea. Describing the first attack, Braintree Police Department said: “Without saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females. “The attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the man ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.” A movie theater concessions worker described the suspect as wearing “an oversized trench coat, sunglasses, and a long blonde wig,” according to CBS Boston. According to local media reports and Ravizza’s Instagram page, their blond flowing hair is real and not a wig, as initially reported by police. Ravizza then fled in a Porsche SUV and drove 30 miles to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he allegedly stabbed the two employees of a rest-stop McDonald’s on Route 3, according to authorities. According to the DA’s office, surveillance video shows Ravizza reaching through the fast food chain’s drive-thru window and stabbing a 28-year-old male employee with a large knife. Officials say Ravizza then parked his black Porsche, went inside the McDonald’s and stabbed a second employee, a 21-year-old woman. Both victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to nearby hospitals. Ravizza then allegedly fled the plaza, eventually totaling the car in a fiery crash on Cotuit Road in Sandwich. Ravizza was taken into custody shortly afterward and is being treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The suspect is due to be arraigned in Plymouth District Court Tuesday.",

        "content": "In a wave of nostalgia sweeping through the Sultanate, memories of the late 90s resurface, bringing with them images of two iconic landmarks of entertainment: Hassanal Bolkiah and Borneo movie theatres. Long before the age of multiplexes, these single-screen cinemas stood as pillars of cinematic delight, etching themselves into the collective consciousness of a generation. The Hassanal Bolkiah Theatre, situated in the heart of the capital, was more than just a building; it was a cultural institution. With its grand facade and imposing marquee, it drew moviegoers from far and wide, promising an evening of enchantment and escapism. Inside, the air hummed with anticipation as patrons settled into their seats, eager for the magic of the silver screen to unfold before them. Across town, the Borneo Theatre casts its own spell, beckoning cinephiles with its distinctive charm and old-world allure. From its ornate architecture to its intimate ambiance, the theatre exuded a sense of nostalgia, transporting audiences to a bygone era of glamour and romance. Here, movie buffs revelled in the timeless allure of cinema, immersing themselves in stories that spanned the gamut of human experience. For those who frequented these beloved theatres, it was about more than just watching movies – it was about community, camaraderie, and shared moments of joy. Whether catching the latest blockbuster or attending a special screening of a local production, patrons forged bonds that transcended the confines of the silver screen. However, as the dawn of the new millennium approached, winds of change swept through Brunei’s entertainment landscape. Multiplex cinemas began to emerge, offering audiences a wider selection of films and state-of-the-art amenities. While these developments signalled progress, they also marked the end of an era for traditional single-screen theatres. Today, the memories of these iconic theatres live on in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to experience their magic. Though their doors may have closed long ago, their legacy endures as a testament to the power of cinema to captivate, inspire, and unite us all. As Brunei continues to embrace the future of entertainment, let us pause for a moment to reflect on the rich tapestry of history woven by the Hassanal Bolkiah and Borneo theatres. In remembering the past, we honour the stories that have shaped us and celebrate the enduring legacy of two beloved institutions that will forever hold a special place in our hearts. – Fadley Faisal ABOVE & BELOW: The Hassanal Bolkiah Theatre; and Borneo Theatre.

        "description": "The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks",
        "content": "A British official called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to ratify the ’s entry into a by the end of the year, despite opposition from some Canadian agriculture groups. The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks, which may also be delaying Canadian action to help the U.K. join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, known by the acronym CPTPP. The U.K. signed onto the latter accord last July, and its Parliament formally ratified the deal last week. But before it can start enjoying the benefits, the U.K. needs six of the CPTPP’s 11 members to ratify its accession — and so far only Singapore, Japan, and Chile have done so. Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng has yet to introduce a ratification bill in the country’s House of Commons. Jennifer Fagan, head of economics and trade at the U.K. High Commission in Canada, said her country is especially keen to have Canada’s support, given their close ties as allies and Canada’s status as chair of the CPTPP Commission this year. “We understand that it’s a busy parliamentary season for Canada, but we’re hoping that it’ll be imminent that Canada will put that legislation forward,” Fagan said in an interview. Fagan said she believes the U.K. will get enough other countries to ratify before the end of 2024, but would hope that Canada does so given that it was “an early champion of the U.K. accession.” Fagan made the comments shortly before British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called an election for July 4, which polls suggest the Labour Party will win. Under Sunak, the U.K. suspended free trade talks with Canada after Trudeau’s government allowed some post-Brexit trade provisions to expire. Those included a temporary arrangement that permitted low-tariff exports of British cheese to Canada and another that affected British auto exports to Canada. Canadian and British officials insist those issues are separate from discussions around CPTPP. But there may be other reasons Canada is dragging its heels. An alliance of Canadian agriculture groups is lobbying against the U.K.’s accession to the Pacific pact, arguing that it doesn’t give enough access for producers currently blocked from the U.K. market. “This agreement does not achieve any meaningful market access for the Canadian beef and pork industries and creates significant barriers for Canadian farmers, ranchers and producers,” the coalition says on its website. Ng said Canada still supports the U.K.’s entry into CPTPP but remained non-committal on a timeline for a vote in parliament. “It’s definitely in the queue,” she said in a phone interview while attending a trade forum in Peru. “It’s certainly something we’ve committed to doing, and we intend to.”",

        "description": "The latest documentary from the director of Whitney skirts around the issues raised by the anti-Semitism and subsequent revival of former Dior and Givenchy creative director John Galliano.",
        "content": "Models throwing fresh mackerel at audience members; impersonating a lion while naked in a hotel elevator for four hours straight; a signature style of cutting fabric on the bias, giving birth to the iconic black slip dresses that took over in the 90s and forever after. Fashion designer John Galliano has made headlines for his virtuosic, generation-defining work on the catwalk as much as for his ludicrous antics offstage. Fast facts about High & Low — John Galliano : The rise, fall and revival of one of fashion's most mercurial and controversial figures. : John Galliano, Anna Wintour, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Charlize Theron. : In cinemas from May 30. : Ambivalent. But for a documentary that recounts the divisive figure's inexplicable fall from grace and everything that preceded it, High & Low is structured rather conventionally. Interspersing archival footage with talking head interviews and snippets of a six-day-long conversation with Galliano himself, the documentary unfolds largely chronologically. As he traces the career of a larger-than-life figure, director Kevin Macdonald (Whitney; The Last King of Scotland) has to contend with what Galliano is most infamous for: successive anti-Semitic outbursts that resulted in him being prosecuted by a French court and sacked as creative director of Dior in 2011. And that is how the documentary opens – Galliano's recorded racist tirade is presented in all its jaw-dropping horridness. As Macdonald charts Galliano's life, it's almost as though he's excavating it for clues, signs, justifications as to what transpired. We're thrust into Galliano's troubled childhood and the halcyon days of his youth. Growing up within a cloistered Spanish-Gibraltan migrant family who moved to London when Galliano was six, the budding creative learns to live in his head as he comes to terms with his queerness, while living in a homophobic household intent on quashing it. The liberatory, fashion-forward subversiveness of the underground New Romantic movement in London arrives as a breath of fresh air after the repressiveness of Galliano's childhood. Macdonald expertly evokes the trend through the reverberations of 80s synth-pop and the quaint sheen of low-resolution photographs. The documentary hurtles along the trajectory of his career, including Galliano cutting his teeth as a fresh-faced ingenue straight out of the famed art school Central Saint Martins. The graduate fashion show that put him on the map – the French Revolution-inspired Les Incroyables – leads to multiple career-defining runway productions, before Galliano is offered the role of creative director at Givenchy and is promptly whisked away to be creative director at Dior. This is where he gains unprecedented levels of fame and adulation, and when his mental health precipitously declines. The theme of escapism and the salve of an imagination are mainstays of Galliano's work, but as his fashion shows become increasingly elevated flights of fantasy, with models more like actors than exhibitors of clothing, his grip on reality also loosens. Addictions to work, substances and exercise begin to take hold as Galliano suffers devastating losses in his personal life – first his father, then his life anchor and right-hand man Steven Robinson – while the unrelenting demands of being a fashion designer never abate. In one particularly revealing section, Galliano describes working on more than 32 collections a year. Exacerbating the melancholy are black-and-white clips from the 1927 silent film Napoléon – in part underlining Galliano's growing godlike complex, his \"Napoleonic display of ego\", in part a homage to Galliano's lifelong preoccupation with the figure. The dichotomy between the high and low is ever-present throughout the documentary. Galliano, the son of a plumber and the unlikely face of Dior, is seen as \"everything but a bourgeois\" by the French fashion establishment — even as he's flanked by Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Anna Wintour and is picketed for appropriating the aesthetic of homelessness in one of his shows. The dizzying, meteoric highs of delivering yet another critically acclaimed runway production are followed by the lowest of lows and multiple-day benders. The staggering, unattainable beauty of the clothes, narratives and fantasies that Galliano creates is complicated by the market imperative for art to be commodified and accessible to the very people that keep fashion houses in business. High & Low doesn't offer easy, or even compelling, answers to the reasons and consequences of a public figure behaving in a morally objectionable way. Galliano is once again a working designer, this time for small but reputable fashion house Maison Margiela, and he staged a hyperbolically received couture show in January. In Galliano, Macdonald has a theatrical, animated subject who's incredibly adept at narrativising his own life. But he also has an unreliable narrator whose testimonies are directly at odds with the word of many people who surrounded him at key junctures of his life. Right at the start of High & Low, Galliano boldly utters, \"I am going to tell you everything\", but in truth, he doesn't tell us much – whether due to inability or unwillingness is unclear. The coterie of high-profile models and tastemakers who stand by him attribute his anti-Semitism to his illness, to his addiction. Sidney Toledano, the Jewish chief executive of Dior at the time, muses that it may be because of his Catholic upbringing. Galliano himself doesn't know, and scarcely remembers two of the three inciting incidents. Washington Post critic Robin Givhan doesn't have an answer, but comes closest to articulating the consequences, or lack thereof, when people including Galliano behave objectionably: \"He's a white man.\" There are some pressing questions around Galliano: Does creative genius exempt moral shortcomings? Can we, should we, separate the art from the artist? Should people get second chances (or in Galliano's case, fourth chances)? And who gets to decide who deserves a second chance? Unfortunately, High & Low skirts around them all.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? The fate of a historic but structurally unsound 140-year-old downtown church is in question, but the property’s future won’t be. So says Bishop of Rupert’s Land Geoff Woodcroft, who recently granted permission to Holy Trinity Anglican Church’s congregation to explore the possibility of selling the property. The current cost of repairing the structure at 256 Smith St. — which is designated a Historic Site of Canada and a protected historical property by the city — is in the neighbourhood of $7 million. “I quite clearly have said it’s conditional on any buyer, partner, investor or developer to first, preserve and maintain the historic structure, second, to make space available for Holy Trinity to hold worship services, and third, to secure space and opportunity for the church to continue its important mission work,” Woodcroft told the , adding there are ongoing conversations to make those things a reality. “I want every effort to be made to ensure it continues to provide space for a worshipping body and to continue to do its mission work in the downtown.” The conditions of any sale include enabling parishioners to meet for Sunday services and also for the church to offer its weekly neighbourhood lunch program — which serves more than 10,000 meals a year — providing a regular social connection in addition to food for the hungry. A 1989 geographical survey determined the building, which was built without a foundation, has significant structural deficiencies. Woodcroft said he understands the serious nature of the problem, but is adamant the diocese will not accept bids to redevelop the site for a new condo tower, for example. The bishop would not say whether the building would be saved from demolition. “The minute the article came out (last week in the my inbox was flooded with emails from developers inquiring about buying the building,” he said. The bishop is looking at the situation from a theological perspective. “What does God want for the body of Christ in downtown Winnipeg?” he said. “I’m pretty sure it’s not another skyscraper so we can sell it and make money off to balance our budget.” He said he believes the diocese should think about ways it can continue to serve “people, nature and creation” downtown, perhaps in partnership with other area churches or businesses. Quoting Jesus in the Gospel of John, he said “we want everyone in the downtown to have life and have it abundantly, whether that’s through worship, music, meals. That’s our call.” And while he appreciates the beauty and historical significance of the building — considered a fine example of 19th-century Gothic Revival style — it would be a shame if it is only seen as a matter of losing a historic landmark, he said. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “It’s not just a building, but a way that God is using the body of Christ to serve people in the city, about God’s vision of abundance for the world,” he said. One model for Holy Trinity could be what happened at St. Matthews Anglican Church — now the WestEnd Commons — which was transformed into housing while keeping space for worship, he said. “But first we want to allow the church and others to dream about what Holy Trinity could be,” he said. According to Anglican church policy, all parishes own their own buildings and property, but need permission from the bishop to sell. All proceeds from the sale of churches goes to the diocese. faith@freepress.mb.ca John Longhurst has been writing for Winnipeg's faith pages since 2003.

        "description": "Here's what you need to know about Jalen Brunson's contract extension before he becomes eligible to put pen to paper",
        "content": "Jalen Brunson has the decision of a lifetime on his hands. If Brunson foregoes a contract extension with the Knicks this summer, he could be in line for a significant raise should he wait another season before inking a new deal. A massive pay raise worth the risk, however, is not a foregone conclusion. Here’s what you need to know about Brunson’s contract extension before he becomes eligible to put pen to paper when the season is over. July 12 marks the two-year anniversary to the date Brunson signed a four-year, $104 million contract leaving the Dallas Mavericks for the Knicks in free agency. The deal, along with many others for the Knicks front office, has been viewed as a large success. The Knicks have secured back-to-back second-round playoff appearances since Brunson signed. His 28.73 points per game in the 2023-4 season ranks third all-time in Knicks single-season scoring behind only Bernard King and Richie Guessing, meaning yes: Brunson’s campaign outpaced vaunted Knicks scorers Carmelo Anthony and Patrick Ewing. He also captained one of just 14 Knicks teams to ever reach the 50-win mark, powering New York to the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 seed for just the second time since Ewing in 1994 and the first time since Anthony in 2013. Not bad for a player whose salary ranked 53rd in all of basketball last season. Next season, Brunson will fall to 56th on the league-wide payroll list because his contract with the Knicks was frontloaded. He earned more in Year 1 ($27.73 million) than he will in Years 3 or 4 ($24.96 million). In fact, Brunson’s upcoming contract extension would be north of $17 million more lucrative if his contract was structured in a traditional manner paying more on the back end as opposed to the front. Instead, he will be eligible for a 40 percent raise on the final year of his deal, or a four-year contract extension worth $156.5 million. The payout schedule could look as follows: In this instance, Brunson would decline the player option on the fourth and final year (worth $24.96 million) of his current contract and these extension years would follow Year 3 on his current deal (also worth $24.96 million). His contract would essentially become a five-year deal in New York worth $181 million. The Knicks will own Brunson’s Larry Bird rights at the conclusion of his third full season played in New York. This will allow the Knicks to exceed the salary cap to re-sign Brunson to his maximum salary, which is 30 percent of the cap for players with seven-to-nine years of experience, and 35 percent of the cap for players who meet the higher-max criteria of making All-NBA either the year before signing the extension or two of the three years prior to the season before singing the extension. Brunson, for example, would be eligible for the supermax of 35 percent of the cap if he earned All-NBA honors again next season. That would be a five-year, $314.85 million deal, worth more than double the amount of the four-year, $156.5 million extension currently awaiting the All-Star guard this summer. All-NBA honors, however, are not a foregone conclusion. Brunson, for example, made Second Team All-NBA this season, but here are the players at his position who failed to qualify for the voting process due to not meeting the NBA’s new 65-game requirement for end-of-the-season awards and honors: And since All-NBA teams are now positionless, you can add Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves), Kristaps Porzingis (Boston Celtics) and New York’s own Julius Randle as players who did not play 65 games last season that Brunson would now be competing against for All-NBA honors. If Brunson failed to make an All-NBA team next year, he would remain eligible for a deal worth 30 percent of the cap, a five-year deal worth $269.8 million. It’s about $114 million more than he could get if he signs the extension this summer. Brunson’s season ended on a fractured left hand , and an injury next season without a contract guarantee would put the star Knicks guard in a disadvantageous bargaining position. Brunson might not earn what his All-Star caliber peers are generating, but Jeff Van Gundy once famously said while calling a game “comparison is the thief of joy,” and few things bring Brunson more joy than winning basketball games. Taking a pay cut, though it’s a 40 percent raise, will give the Knicks more flexibility to pursue an additional max-salary level player after Brunson’s extension kicks in. Brunson is only one player the Knicks have decisions to make on this offseason. After trading Immanuel Quickley, R.J. Barrett and pick No. 31 in the upcoming 2024 NBA Draft, the Knicks must re-sign OG Anunoby to a long-term deal. They must figure out what the center position looks like with Isaiah Hartenstein entering free agency with his value having doubled since the season began and Mitchell Robinson undergoing his second stress reaction surgery on his left ankle in a five-month span. The Knicks must also decide on a course of action with the pair of first-round picks (Nos. 24 and 25) in the upcoming draft. They must also make a decision on Randle, the three-time All-Star perpetually included in trade rumors. Brunson signing the extension now gives the Knicks and their fans one fewer thing to worry about. Though you can’t fault someone for betting on themselves. After all, there’s $114 million on the table if Brunson decides he wants to go and get it. And there’s $181 million staring him in the face the moment he becomes eligible to sign the extension on July 12.",

        "description": "The company, which is a minority-owned federal contractor, will pay a penalty and be monitored to ensure compliance with U.S. anti-discrimination laws.",
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor and the Justice Department have reached an agreement with a Virginia-based IT staffing firm after finding a job posting discriminatory. Here, the Labor Department building is seen in Washington, D.C. Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A job posting that included race and citizenship requirements — and the stipulation, “Don’t share with candidates” — has resulted in settlement agreements between Virginia-based IT staffing firm Arthur Grand Technologies Inc. and the U.S. government. Under the arrangement, Arthur Grand will pay a civil penalty of $7,500, along with a total of $31,000 to 31 people who complained about the posting. The company — which is minority-owned and a federal contractor designated a disadvantaged business — will also be monitored to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws. “It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using ‘whites only’ and ‘only US born’ job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which announced the agreements . Arthur Grand “neither admits nor denies any violation,” the Department of Labor’s agreement states . But in a message to NPR, Arthur Grand CEO Sheik Rahmathullah said his company \"vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing.\" The job posting was made by a rogue employee, he said. The job posting sparked outrage and accusations of discrimination when it circulated online last year , reading, “Only Born US Citizens [White] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX [Don’t share with candidates].” The words in brackets are not paraphrases; they appeared in brackets in the posting, the Justice Department noted. Arthur Grand Technologies was seeking someone to work in a “Salesforce Business Analyst and Insurance Claims position,” the Labor Department said. The job was to be based in Dallas. The business analyst position \"would serve two clients, HTC Global an information technology company based in Troy, Michigan, and Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska,\" the DOJ stated, citing the job listing. The DOJ said Arthur Grand’s listing in March of 2023 violated the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Labor Department said the company also violated a long-standing executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating based on race, national origin and other protected characteristics. In its separate agreement with Arthur Grand , the Labor Department says it also found other violations, saying the company didn’t have records tracking demographic characteristics of job applicants, such as their gender, race or ethnicity; and that the company didn’t post a notice of workers’ equal employment opportunity rights in conspicuous places. “We are committed to holding federal contractors accountable for outrageous discriminatory practices like this advertisement,” said Acting Director Michele Hodge of the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). “Companies like Arthur Grand, that accept federal contracts, cannot have a ‘whites only’ hiring process.” The Labor Department's agreement with the company includes a form letter to be sent to people who complained about Arthur Grand. They're told that if they want to take part in the agreement, they must sign a document reading in part, “I understand that AGT denies that it treated me unlawfully or unfairly in any way.” By signing the document and receiving payment, the letter states, the complainants also agree not to file a lawsuit against the company. Rahmathullah emphasized that Arthur Grand did not admit any guilt or wrongdoing, telling NPR that the staffing firm agreed to the DOJ and Labor deals \"solely to avoid the significant financial toll and prolonged disruption that litigation would impose on our company.\" \"Arthur Grand Technologies vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing in relation to the discriminatory job posting,\" Rahmathullah said. The job notice was an \"unauthorized posting,\" he added. When the company became aware of what had happened, Rahmathullah said, \"we took immediate and decisive action to ensure that this type of incident will never happen again, including the immediate termination of the responsible employee.\" The CEO added, \"we sincerely apologize for any harm caused by this incident and are committed to making meaningful changes to maintain the trust and confidence of our community and stakeholders.\" The Justice Department acknowledged in its settlement agreement that the company had denied approving the job posting, with Arthur Grand asserting “that the posted advertisement was generated by a disgruntled recruiter in India and was intended to embarrass the company,” according to the DOJ. It’s an IT staffing firm, based in Ashburn, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C. The company's listed address corresponds to a two-story office complex about 10 miles north of Dulles International Airport. Its neighbors include dental and orthodontics offices, and an insurance company. \"We take pride in the fact that all the senior leadership positions in our company are held by persons of color, and over 80% of our staff are also people of color,\" Rahmathullah told NPR. According to U.S. government records , Arthur Grand is certified as a Small Disadvantaged Business in the roster of federal contractors. To qualify for that status, a majority of the company must be owned by “one or more disadvantaged persons,” who must also be “socially disadvantaged and economically disadvantaged.” “Each year, the Federal Government awards about 10% of all federal contract dollars, or roughly $50 billion in contracts, to Small Disadvantaged Businesses,” according to the Small Business Administration .",

        "content": "AS Jarvis Cocker and Pulp once sang, Do You Remember The First Time? Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George , Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer , showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. DUAL frontmen Pete Doherty and Carl Barat formed the Libertines while living together in Camden Road, topping and tailing in a single bed with no covers. And the pair would often put on impromptu “guerilla gigs” at their flat, sometimes with less than an hour’s notice. Carl, 45, says: “Peter’s parents were in an Army base so they’d always come home and bring supplies, like crates of beer and cigarillos, cigars and frankfurter sausages. “So we made a bar and invited everyone in Camden.” Pete, 45, adds: “I’d say to Carl, ‘Look, don’t get the hump, but I’ve put online we’re doing a gig in the front room in an hour’. “He’d be fuming, like, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve got my washing drying!’. “Like basic things, perfectly reasonable, but he’d still do it.” As the Libertines got more popular, fans would cram into the living room and the police would turn up. Carl says: “The front door ended up broken and we had to climb through a window. “We finally got booted out when we nicked all the money out of the electricity meter. I do look back and think, ‘Jesus, that was disgusting, I wouldn’t do that again’. “But then also think, if you’re an artist, you need to live your life before you can write about it. “And those formative times you have are everything.” THE Good Mixer was the place to be for anyone in the Britpop crowd during the Nineties. The toilets in the small, two-roomed Irish bar are even said to be where Oasis and Blur’s feud first began — with Oasis singer Liam Gallagher saying to Blur guitarist Graham Coxon: “Nice music, s**t clothes.” Liam’s brother Noel, 56, says: “As I remember it, we were just good-naturedly ribbing Graham Coxon. “But it turns out it probably wasn’t that good-natured.” And Blur were not the only band Liam, 51, clashed with there. The Libertines’ Pete Doherty and Carl Barat recall seeing Oasis propping up the bar there during their heyday. But when they went over to try to talk to Liam, Carl says: “He kept knocking me out the way, like it was his defence mechanism.” Pete adds: “I was like, ‘Liam, we’ve got a basement round the corner, you should come and play some stuff’. “He goes, ‘Mate, I don’t do that sort of thing because I’m the devil’s d**k’. “That was the best thing I’d ever heard. But a bit disappointing, as well.” THE singer, who died in 2011 at the age of 27, lived in the borough and was a regular drinker at The Hawley Arms, where she would hop behind the bar to pull pints. Amy’s former manager, Nick Shymansky, says in the documentary: “Genuinely, from the moment I heard her voice, and met her, I was completely convinced. “I had no doubt she was the best of the best.” He adds: “The big record at the time was the Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill and not long after I heard Amy’s demo, I remember instantly going this is as good as Lauryn Hill, if not better. “So whatever I do, I have to work with this artist. “The first deal we did was a publishing deal and she got her cheque and was like, ‘Right, I’m going to buy a flat in Camden’, and then a whole new thing opened up. “Her idea of a good night would be to see someone live, play some pool, have a cocktail, go back, roll a spliff, play music until 2 or 3 in the morning, and not get up until lunchtime the next day.” Nick adds that when success came for Amy, however, it wasn’t enough. He explains: “The first record wasn’t full of hit songs and maybe it hadn’t fulfilled her in the way she was hoping it would. “That was the moment where this void opened up and as an artist I think she wanted to be seen as someone a little bit more exciting and edgy. “Camden at that point was probably quite a dangerous place for someone like her to live. “She started to go out to the pubs , the drink maybe turned into a line. It was her nature of drinking people under the table, the ‘I can do more drugs, I can be more wild, I can be more dangerous’ attitude. “She got lost in it.” IRISH pub The Dublin Castle is famous for having hosted everyone from Blur to The Killers and Arctic Monkeys. Its legendary status dates back to 1979 when the late Alo Conlon, landlord at the time, decided to indulge seven teenagers claiming to be a jazz band. That band was a local rabble known as Madness. Frontman Suggs, 63, recalls: “We’d been into a lot of pubs, so this was like our last chance. We walked in and it was like being in Cork. “They asked what sort of music we played and we said country and western, thinking it’s going to go down better with an Irish crowd. “Then Woody, at the back, helpfully chipped in with, ‘And a bit of jazz’.” They were given a trial slot for that Wednesday — and “they packed us out,” says current landlord Henry Conlon. He adds: “I remember being in the back bar peeping over at these young skinheads.” Madness then got a residency at the pub, with queues out the door every Wednesday. Suggs says: “It was 75p to get in, so we’d get a fiver each. “One night I put my foot through the monitor and that was 40 quid so we all went home skint.” The band later filmed the video for hit 1979 single My Girl at the pub. In it, Alo can be seen at the start, referring to himself as “the governor”. ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids. No one’s coming in because they’ve heard Wonderwall on the radio.” He adds: “We were into making money and having a good time and all of the girls and drugs and all of that”. But they soon hit the big time. Liam and his then-wife Patsy Kensit , 56, moved to posh Primrose Hill, while Noel and his then-wife Meg Mathews, 58, were in nearby Steele’s Road. Their seven-bedroom mansion, affectionately named Supernova Heights, was where the Primrose Hill set — which included actor Jude Law and model Kate Moss — would throw outrageous parties, packed to the brim with A-list stars. But Noel recalls that one time fans managed to gatecrash. He says: “Someone thought they were my mates, and I thought they were someone else’s. “Turns out they were a random group of indie kids who’d followed us back from the bar, wearing Doc Martens and jackets. “They’d just wandered in and sat there for hours. I was like, ‘Can you f*** off then?’.”",

Carl, 45, says: “Peter’s parents were in an Army base so they’d always come home and bring supplies, like crates of beer and cigarillos, cigars and frankfurter sausages. “So we made a bar and invited everyone in Camden.” Pete, 45, adds: “I’d say to Carl, ‘Look, don’t get the hump, but I’ve put online we’re doing a gig in the front room in an hour’. “He’d be fuming, like, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve got my washing drying!’. “Like basic things, perfectly reasonable, but he’d still do it.” As the Libertines got more popular, fans would cram into the living room and the police would turn up. Carl says: “The front door ended up broken and we had to climb through a window. “We finally got booted out when we nicked all the money out of the electricity meter. I do look back and think, ‘Jesus, that was disgusting, I wouldn’t do that again’. “But then also think, if you’re an artist, you need to live your life before you can write about it. “And those formative times you have are everything.” THE Good Mixer was the place to be for anyone in the Britpop crowd during the Nineties. The toilets in the small, two-roomed Irish bar are even said to be where Oasis and Blur’s feud first began — with Oasis singer Liam Gallagher saying to Blur guitarist Graham Coxon: “Nice music, s**t clothes.” Liam’s brother Noel, 56, says: “As I remember it, we were just good-naturedly ribbing Graham Coxon. “But it turns out it probably wasn’t that good-natured.” And Blur were not the only band Liam, 51, clashed with there. The Libertines’ Pete Doherty and Carl Barat recall seeing Oasis propping up the bar there during their heyday. But when they went over to try to talk to Liam, Carl says: “He kept knocking me out the way, like it was his defence mechanism.” Pete adds: “I was like, ‘Liam, we’ve got a basement round the corner, you should come and play some stuff’. “He goes, ‘Mate, I don’t do that sort of thing because I’m the devil’s d**k’. “That was the best thing I’d ever heard. But a bit disappointing, as well.” THE singer, who died in 2011 at the age of 27, lived in the borough and was a regular drinker at The Hawley Arms, where she would hop behind the bar to pull pints. Amy’s former manager, Nick Shymansky, says in the documentary: “Genuinely, from the moment I heard her voice, and met her, I was completely convinced. “I had no doubt she was the best of the best.” He adds: “The big record at the time was the Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill and not long after I heard Amy’s demo, I remember instantly going this is as good as Lauryn Hill, if not better. “So whatever I do, I have to work with this artist. “The first deal we did was a publishing deal and she got her cheque and was like, ‘Right, I’m going to buy a flat in Camden’, and then a whole new thing opened up. “Her idea of a good night would be to see someone live, play some pool, have a cocktail, go back, roll a spliff, play music until 2 or 3 in the morning, and not get up until lunchtime the next day.” Nick adds that when success came for Amy, however, it wasn’t enough. He explains: “The first record wasn’t full of hit songs and maybe it hadn’t fulfilled her in the way she was hoping it would. “That was the moment where this void opened up and as an artist I think she wanted to be seen as someone a little bit more exciting and edgy. “Camden at that point was probably quite a dangerous place for someone like her to live. “She started to go out to the pubs, the drink maybe turned into a line. It was her nature of drinking people under the table, the ‘I can do more drugs, I can be more wild, I can be more dangerous’ attitude. “She got lost in it.” IRISH pub The Dublin Castle is famous for having hosted everyone from Blur to The Killers and Arctic Monkeys. Its legendary status dates back to 1979 when the late Alo Conlon, landlord at the time, decided to indulge seven teenagers claiming to be a jazz band. That band was a local rabble known as Madness. Frontman Suggs, 63, recalls: “We’d been into a lot of pubs, so this was like our last chance. We walked in and it was like being in Cork. “They asked what sort of music we played and we said country and western, thinking it’s going to go down better with an Irish crowd. “Then Woody, at the back, helpfully chipped in with, ‘And a bit of jazz’.” They were given a trial slot for that Wednesday — and “they packed us out,” says current landlord Henry Conlon. He adds: “I remember being in the back bar peeping over at these young skinheads.” Madness then got a residency at the pub, with queues out the door every Wednesday. Suggs says: “It was 75p to get in, so we’d get a fiver each. “One night I put my foot through the monitor and that was 40 quid so we all went home skint.” The band later filmed the video for hit 1979 single My Girl at the pub. In it, Alo can be seen at the start, referring to himself as “the governor”. ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids. No one’s coming in because they’ve heard Wonderwall on the radio.” He adds: “We were into making money and having a good time and all of the girls and drugs and all of that”. But they soon hit the big time. Liam and his then-wife Patsy Kensit, 56, moved to posh Primrose Hill, while Noel and his then-wife Meg Mathews, 58, were in nearby Steele’s Road. Their seven-bedroom mansion, affectionately named Supernova Heights, was where the Primrose Hill set — which included actor Jude Law and model Kate Moss — would throw outrageous parties, packed to the brim with A-list stars. But Noel recalls that one time fans managed to gatecrash. He says: “Someone thought they were my mates, and I thought they were someone else’s. “Turns out they were a random group of indie kids who’d followed us back from the bar, wearing Doc Martens and jackets. “They’d just wandered in and sat there for hours. I was like, ‘Can you f*** off then?’.”",

        "content": "Nicki Minaj is performing in Amsterdam the night before her newly rescheduled show at Manchester's Co-op Live. The American rapper announced that she would be bringing her Pink Friday 2 tour back to Manchester on the new date of June 3 . It comes after the 41-year-old was detained by authorities at Amsterdam airport on Saturday night (May 25) for allegedly 'possessing soft drugs' when police searched her luggage, as she was set to fly to Manchester . She was later fined by Dutch police. She said spent around six hours in custody after being arrested at the Schiphol Airport, before eventually being able to fly to the UK for her gig at Co-op Live arena. READ MORE Nicki Minaj confirms new date for postponed Co-op Live show But over two hours after fans had been let into the music venue, promoter Live Nation then announced to thousands of fans already inside the concert was being postponed and would be rescheduled . Posting to X on Monday (May 27), the star wrote: \"OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up #gagcityMANCHESTER date besides JUNE 3rd. So JUNE 3rd is the new official date for all ticket holders who originally had tickets to the MAY 25th #Manchester show. \"I apologize for all the inconvenience this has caused. I really hope you can make the #JUNE3rd show. It’ll be really special. Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially.\" However fans then comically pointed out that Minaj is actually back in Amsterdam again the night before, at the Ziggo Dome, on June 2. \"And she’s in Amsterdam on the 2nd June too...\" one person commented on social media as another wrote: \"Don’t get arrested now.\" A third posted: \"The venue and her ...What could possibly go wrong.\" After the announcement of the new date, fans also took to X, as one wrote: \"June 3rd is gonna be another Manchester date after Amsterdam...I’m kinda scared.\" Another posted: \"Amsterdam police have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever\" as a third shared: \"Nicki your in Amsterdam the day before we don’t wanna have the same problems I think you should change it.\" The rapper's gig, at the Co-op Live in Manchester on Saturday, had been first thrown into doubt after Minaj posted on X that she had been detained by police for items in her luggage at 3pm. Six hours later, fans were still waiting inside the venue for an update as to whether she would make it or not. Crowds leaving the Co-op Live Arena following the postponement of Nicki Minaj's concert (Image: Lottie Gibbons) During the chaos, Minaj put a series of social media posts on X saying 'they're trying to keep me from MANCHESTER'. In a string of posts on her profile, she said that her luggage has been taken at the airport while travelling from Amsterdam to attend the gig. The star has since promised an 'added surprise bonus' for fans at the newly scheduled gig on June 3, and said she was 'looking forward' to returning to Manchester for an already planned second night at Co-op Live on Thursday.",

Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. 9 Pete Doherty, left, recalls meeting Liam Gallagher in a new Disney+ documentary about the music scene in Camden Credit: PA 9 Rocker Liam pictured with then-wife Patsy Kensit Credit: Getty The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George, Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer, showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. Camden is available to stream on Disney+ from tomorrow.

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail A banking code of conduct that would regulate branch closures similar to regulations in the UK would be a crucial way to safeguard access to cash for regional communities, according to a finance expert. A senate report released on Friday found more than 2100 bank branches were closed in Australia between 2017 and 2023 - almost 40 per cent of branches. It also found while the use of cash is declining across the economy, cash ﻿and face-to-face banking services remain important in regional and remote areas, during times of crisis and by the vulnerable, elderly and disabled. READ MORE: Community rallies for mother mourning death of her toddler son﻿ Cash is still king in many communities across Australia, despite the rise of digital banking. (Reuters/Edgar Su/File Photo) The report listed eight recommendations including that ﻿the government recognises access to financial services as an \"essential service\" and that it creates a mandatory banking code of conduct, citing the UK model as an example. RMIT University finance researcher and associate professor Dr Angel Zhong supports a mandatory banking code of conduct in Australia that would require banks to consult with the community and seek regulatory approval before closing a branch. She cited the UK's \"three-mile rule\", where ﻿banks are required to provide free cash services within three miles (4.8km) for rural residents and one mile (1.6km) for urban dwellers. This doesn't necessarily have to be via a bank branch or ATM, but can also include shops that offer cash-out transactions for free and other alternatives.﻿ Introduced last year, the legislation aims to maintain current levels of access to cash across the UK by fining banks that fall below a minimum level of service.﻿ \"The UK's approach recognises that while digital payments are on the rise, cash remains essential for certain transactions,\" Zhong said. \"﻿By safeguarding access, they address the concerns of rural communities and vulnerable individuals.\"﻿ Australia's geography and distribution of population makes the three-mile rule difficult to replicate in Australia, an Australian Banking Association spokesperson told 9news.com.au. \"Australia has unique geographical challenges with cash distribution that many other countries don't face,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Australia for example is 32 times the size of the United Kingdom. \"The banking sector remains committed to ensuring cash continues to be accessible to customers. \"Banks provide fee-free ATM withdrawals at 85 of Australia's most remote communities. \"Banks also pay for cash services to be available at around 1800 regional Bank@Post locations.\" The senate report's recommendations also include the expansion of Bank@Post services with Australia Post as well as the establishment of a community banking program and examining the feasibility of a publicly owned bank.﻿ Given the history of state-owned banks within Australia, Zhong said that option should be a \"last resort\". \"I think (the mandatory code of conduct) is a better approach to strike a balance between preserving the value of taxpayers' money and also ensuring that within Australia, Australians have access to cash and banking facilities.\"",

        "content": "Matching your mom? That’s hot. Paris Hilton and her 6-month-old daughter, London , wore coordinating pink ensembles during a recent family vacation to Hawaii. The “Stars Are Blind” singer, 43, shared sweet snaps of herself posing with London and son Phoenix, 16 months — whom she shares with husband Carter Reum — in which she and her baby girl don equally rosy attire. Hilton rocked a light pink T-shirt that read “PARIS” in rhinestones with matching shorts. Meanwhile, London wore a pink onesie emblazoned with rainbows, hearts and stars. Both accessorized their looks with pink sunglasses. Meanwhile, Phoenix looked adorable in what appeared to be a striped bathing suit bottom. “Reliving my childhood and carrying on our family vacation tradition at the @GrandWailea with my beautiful family🥰🌸,” Hilton wrote on Instagram. The adorable trio cuddled up together on a fuzzy pink blanket covered in Hilton’s signature “That’s Hot” catchphrase, plus images of kiss marks and diamonds. The fragrance mogul’s brother Barron Hilton, his wife, Tessa Hilton, and their kids joined Paris, Reum, 43, and their children on the tropical getaway in Maui. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Earlier this month, proud aunt Nicky Hilton gushed in an exclusive interview with Page Six that London is the “spitting image” of her — while Nicky’s daughter, Lily-Grace, 7, is a Paris mini-me. “London looks exactly like me as a child,” the fashion designer said of her sister’s second kid. “And my daughter looks exactly like Paris as a child, so it’s very interesting how the genes crossed.” Nicky, 40 — who also shares daughter Teddy, 6, and son Chasen, 23 months, with husband James Rothschild — added, “If you look at a picture of my daughter and Paris next to each other, it’s like twins. Same teeth, the almond eyes, everything.” Paris — who welcomed Phoenix and London with Reum via surrogate — has always dreamed of starting a family, especially raising a daughter. “I’m just excited to one day have a little girl named London, and she’ll have her big brother Phoenix to look after her,” she told Vogue in March 2023. “I’ve been planning this for a long time. I just had to find the right partner to do it with. It’s so hard to trust people, and I’m so grateful to have found my husband.”",

Mounties say 34-year-old Arandeep Gill was arrested at a high rise on University Drive in Surrey on Sunday evening. The RCMP says Gill was wanted for eight charges in Surrey including ‘assault with a weapon,’ and three more charges in Langley, but he failed to attend a court date in February. Related: Police have not yet released details about why the entire building needed to be evacuated, but say their crisis negotiation team, emergency response team, gang team, and their canine unit were called to assist. Sgt. Chris De Hart of the Surrey RCMP told CityNews it was an incident between two people who know each other. He added that only Gill was arrested, and there were no injuries. The RCMP said Gill is being held in custody and awaiting a remand hearing. —With files from Srushti Gangdev and Robyn Crawford.",

Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link. CONTINUE READING Show less A “self--inflicted wound” could be to blame if Donald Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial, a former federal prosecutor told the Washington Post . Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open The Spaniard has been close to unbeatable here since winning his first French Open title as a teenager in 2005. He had lost only three out of 115 matches - and dropped only three sets in his previous 18 first round appearances. But Nadal, who turns 38 next month, lost that many sets in just over three hours yesterday as Rome Masters champion Zverev won 6-3 7-6 6-3. After the defeat, Nadal said: \"I would love to thank you all it's difficult for me to talk I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you, I don't know if it is the last time, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt. \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player. For me it's tough to say what's going on in the future. \"There's a bg percentage I won't be back here, but I can't say 100%. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it's enough, I can't give anything else, but it's something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that's motivation. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable – I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it's been a beautiful process.

The Mexican was eliminated in Q1 in Monte Carlo before an opening-lap tangle with Kevin Magnussen brought an end to his race on Sunday. Perez's future beyond 2024 has been a contentious topic for over 12 months now. The 34-year-old struggled throughout the middle portion of the 2023 season, but a more composed end to the year combined with four podiums in five races to kick off 2024 looked to have secured his position within the team. However, since then, his form has tailed off. The Mexican was nowhere near the pace of Lando Norris and Max Verstappen in Miami, and at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, a weak qualifying session forced him to settle for a P8 finish on race day.

The Scot was thrashed in straight sets by Stan Wawrinka at the French Open to follow his early exit in Australia. The three-time Major winner, 37, claimed before the event that he had still to decide if he will retire this summer. \"When the time is right, I will stop\" he said. Murray has always believed he has a final \"good run\" in a Grand Slam but he has now failed to get past the third round in 14 Majors since reaching the 2017 Wimbledon quarter-finals. Pete Sampras won the 2002 US Open final in his last ever match after two years without a title while world No.1 Ash Barty retired aged 25 in 2022 after winning the Australian Open.

By Afeez Hanafi The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, says the state is fully complying with the Local Government autonomy already and as such shouldn’t be dragged to court alongside 35 other states. The federal government had filed a suit at the Supreme Court against the 36 state governors over the LG autonomy. In a suit marked SC/CV/343/2024, the federal government, through attorney-general of the federation (AGF) Lateef Fagbemi, urged the apex court to issue an order, prohibiting state governors from arbitrary and unlawful dissolution of democratically elected local government leaders. The AGF sued the 36 state governors through their respective state attorney generals, with the court fixing Thursday, May 30 for hearing. But Sanwo-Olu said Lagos State should have been left out of the legal action instituted by the Federal Government against Governors at the Supreme Court. Reinstatement of Emir Sanusi done in Kano’s best interest –Gov’t Emirship tussle: Kano Dep Gov retracts allegation against Ribadu To Sanwo-Olu, it was a legal anomaly for the Federal Government to join Lagos in the Supreme Court matter, decades after the local governments in the State had been enjoying full autonomy. The governor spoke at the on-going Justice Reform Summit organised by Lagos State Judiciary with the theme: “Enhancing the Administration of Justice for Economic Growth, Investment Protection and Security in Lagos.” Sanwo-Olu, who spoke in support of the suit, however, said the Attorney General of the Federation should have identified those that were not in compliance with the law before filing a blanket lawsuit against all states. He said: “It is interesting to read the news that the Honorable Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation has sued all the 36 states because Governors did not give autonomy to the third tier of government. The only mistake, which I am going to tell our Attorney General, is that some of us are in compliance. “The Attorney General should have done his due diligence to identify which states are not in compliance, so that we don’t sue all the 36 states together. You can determine which states are not violating the Constitution. If it is three, four or five states that are in compliance, then you can sue the 31 states violating autonomy of the local governments. That is part of the back work that we need to do.” Sanwo-Olu said the judicial reform must remain on the agenda in a functional society in order to improve administration of the justice system and make the court the last hope of the common man. The governor said the judiciary in Lagos had remained a beacon in protecting the rule of law and setting good examples for other jurisdictions in dispensation of justice. But he challenged judges and law officers to change the status quo in order to raise the standard of the justice system. Drawing a parallel with Singapore, a fishing village with environmental similarities with Lagos, Sanwo-Olu said Singapore’s faith in rule of law and fairness transformed the efficiency of the country’s justice system, leading to the country’s rapid economic growth and prosperity. He said: “Just like Lagos, Singapore has no resources. Singapore is what it is today because of Ease of Doing Business. It takes less than 30 minutes to register a business in Singapore, which makes it surpass many countries in ease of doing business. Singapore has one of the best judiciary system in the world; they have quick turnaround time in mediation and dispute resolution.” Sanwo-Olu said Lagos needed a strong judicial system to attain all its investment potential, while promoting transparency and accountability. The Governor urged the Bench and the Bar to collaborate to promote an efficient justice system. Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Kayode Ariwoola, represented Justice Iyabode Yerima of the Supreme Court, hailed Lagos judicial system for being “a forerunner” in justice development, stressing that other jurisdictions usually borrowed from examples set by Lagos. The CJN listed some of landmark examples set by Lagos judiciary in the justice system to include Administration of Criminal Justice laws, which after implementation, set the template for the designing of Criminal Justice Act at the National Assembly. Fagbemi was represented by Mr. Fernandez Marcos-Obiene, said robust and transparent reforms embarked on by Lagos in the justice system had promoted economic growth, pledging that the Federal Government would continue to provide platforms for reforms that would improve public trust in the judiciary.

        "content": "Jamaica's crime plan monitoring group is welcoming the achievement of key targets such as the upgrade of police stations while insisting that more work is needed to deal with at-risk youth and parents. The Crime Consensus Monitoring and Oversight Committee (CMOC) gave the update on its review of the Government's 2022-2023 Citizen Security Plan (CSP) implementation report at its meeting on May 15. CMOC, which comprises civil society and government representatives, said the CSP achieved the full-year targets relating to governance, creation of safe spaces, and Rehabilitation of police stations indicators. \"However, the committee noted that a revamped approach is required to significantly increase the number of parents receiving customised behaviour training and the number of at-risk youth receiving professional qualifications or certifications – both targets that were not attained in the period,\" said a CMOC media statement issued today. CMOC says it supports a request from the CSP Secretariat for the outstanding targets to be adjusted The CSP operates out of the Ministry of National Security and is designed to reduce widespread criminal violence and provide opportunities for the development of vulnerable communities. CMOC's sub-Committee Chairman Bishop Garth Minott said he is in \"full support\" of the strategies, particularly for at-risk youth and case management and psychosocial support being named as two of the prioritised strategies.” “CMOC has been heralding the need for budgetary support for Psychosocial support and we commend the student assessment initiatives and psychological first-aid training that has begun. A lot more is needed, but good to see that the work has started,” the Anglican clergyman added. Chair of CMOC businessman Lloyd Distant said the CSP \"continues to prove what we can achieve when working in a coordinated manner\". Despite the positive results, he said CMOC \"remains in support of the formation of a centralised entity to play a coordinating role in ensuring interconnectedness of initiatives at the community level\". CMOC was established in 2020 as an independent body to assess and report to the public on measures to stem crime and violence. It comprises non-partisan stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, academia, and church, along with representatives of the political directorate.",

Data from FMDQ revealed that the indicative exchange rate for NAFEM decreased from N1,485.66 per dollar to N1,482.81 per dollar, indicating a notable appreciation of N2.85 for the naira. Throughout the day, the market experienced fluctuations, reaching an intraday high of N1,511 per dollar and a low of N1,400 per dollar, resulting in a significant variance of N111 per dollar. The volume of dollars traded (turnover) surged by 35.7 percent, totaling $556.25 million compared to the previous day’s $167.55 million. As a consequence, the gap between the parallel market and NAFEM rates widened to N37.19 per dollar, up from N29.34 per dollar observed on Thursday.

        "description": "Veterans groups solemnly observed Memorial Day but some called for volunteers to step forward as the veteran population ages.",
        "content": "Each May, Dennis Znaniecki calls for residents of the Illinois Valley to commemorate the dead. People respond generously. At Memorial Day 2024, however, Znaniecki called for future volunteers, too. Znaniecki, commander of the Veterans Memorial Group, said Monday it’s getting harder for he and the aging corps of veterans to handle the yearly observances and to ensure Memorial Day is solemnly observed for generations to come. He specifically thanked Boy Scouts Troop 123 and Cub Scouts Pack 3709 for decorating local graves, a duty that had once fallen to the memorial group. “We only have so much longer,” Znaniecki said, “and we’re not going to do events like this.” It’s a theme that resonated at programs across the Illinois Valley. The aging corps of Vietnam veterans – and the fast-dwindling of veterans before them – will need reinforcements to carry on the yearly observances for the fallen. “I love my brothers and I salute them,” said Capt. Mark Kerasotes of the U.S. Army (retired), keynote speaker at the Peru observances. “These men have hearts of 20-year-olds, but they’re not getting younger and could use some help.” The numbers have tumbled since last year – Chaplain Phil Valle read the names of 26 veterans who’ve passed since Memorial Day 2023 – and Monday’s event in Peru honored another figure who recently passed. Former state Sen. Gary Dahl, while not a member of the Peru Veterans Memorial Group, was posthumously lauded for his work on behalf of veterans. Dahl, who died Oct. 1, had served in the U.S. Army as a helicopter mechanic (1958-1962), and spent the rest of his life aiding veterans groups and supporting veterans causes during an eventful stint in the Illinois General Assembly. “He did a lot for us veterans,” Znaniecki said. “He always sold poppies for us and he wasn’t even a part of our group. When we needed volunteers, he was one of the first to jump up, take the mantle and go.” Valle, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force (1966-70), personally knew and admired Gary Dahl – “He was for America” – and enjoyed an even closer relationship with the late Jim Taylor, the posthumous honoree in . Taylor died Oct. 11 following a short bout with cancer. A distinguished athlete at Hall High School (class of 1958), Taylor was drafted in 1964 and honorably discharged two years later earning two Purple Hearts among other honors. Bob Reed, commander of the Spring Valley American Legion and VFW, said James was a pillar of the veterans community and deserving of the posthumous honor. Valle made it a point to be at both the Peru and Spring Valley observances not only to honor his friends but also to honor all whose sacrifices have given Americans unique freedoms. “It was a privilege to serve my country,” Valle said. “We are the best country in the world. We are not perfect, but we are the best.”",

        "description": "\"Sacrifice is not evenly distributed. It's a burden that some carry in a much deeper way than others do. But it is something that is given for all of us.\" — George O'Keefe Jr.",
        "content": "Ed Perry, left, commander of American Legion Post 24 in Rumford, and Hal Watson, commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1641 in Rumford, prepare Monday to lay a wreath at the Memorial Green in Rumford. The Memorial Day observance included an address by George O’Keefe Jr. of Winthrop, who served two tours in Afghanistan and retired from the Army National Guard as a sergeant in 2017. He is economic development director for Rumford. Bruce Farrin/Rumford Falls Times RUMFORD — Members of Napoleon Ouellette Post 24 of the American Legion observed Memorial Day with a parade and ceremonies at the Memorial Green in Rumford and the Veterans Memorial Green in Mexico. People gathered on a misty morning to watch the parade from the Legion Hall at 184 Congress St., over Memorial Bridge to the Memorial Green. There, guest speaker George O’Keefe Jr. of Winthrop, who served two tours in Afghanistan and retired from the Army National Guard as a sergeant in 2017, talked about the sacrifice made to preserve freedom. “On our memorial here, for those who gave their lives and service to our community, you might take a look at some of those names and notice some last names in common, some siblings, and many families who sacrifice more than others, in some cases,” he said. “Sacrifice is not evenly distributed. It’s a burden that some carry in a much deeper way than others do. But it is something that is given for all of us.” O’Keefe, who is the economic development director for Rumford, recalled a wartime speech delivered to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in August 1940 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill: “‘Never was so much owed by so many to so few.’ That is true here and it is true for the very few names that are on our memorials which carry the burden of freedom for all of us.” Military veteran George O’Keefe Jr. of Winthrop gives the keynote speech Monday at Memorial Day ceremonies at the Memorial Green in Rumford. Having served two tours in Afghanistan and retiring from the Army National Guard as a sergeant in 2017, he spoke about the sacrifices made by military personnel and their families. Bruce Farrin/Rumford Falls Times O’Keefe said the name John Henry Ralph Brooks, who died in the Vietnam War on May 14, 1969, “is a name many of you may have never heard. But he died for us, serving in the Army when his helicopter got shot down in Vietnam as part of a mission to bring a small detachment of Republic of Korea soldiers, our allies, serving along side us, as part of combat mission. “Those who die and those whose families survive them, including his sister, who is here with us today, their sacrifice is forever.” O’Keefe said. “For the survivors, it’s a sacrifice that they experience every day, for the rest of their lives.” Another name he mentioned was Roy Tulane O’Keefe. “My uncle, I never met him,” he said. “He died in Vietnam in February of 1968 during the Tet Offensive. His death devastated my father and his eight siblings surviving, and tore the family apart in ways that are still painful to this day.” “I mention his name simply because I have the honor of speaking here today and the opportunity to mention a family member,” O’Keefe said. “But for others, the sacrifice is unnamed, their family member perhaps not always recalled, and their death is something that is only remembered by ceremonies such as this, which are very important because they remind of the sacrifice that others have made.” “At least today, we remember all those who gave so much for us,” he said. Members of the chorus at Mountain Valley High School in Rumford sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on Monday during the Memorial Day ceremony at the Memorial Green in Rumford.

        "description": "Grave lapses at Delhi Baby Care Centre, fire safety norms flouted",
        "content": "Listen to Story After a major blaze at the Baby Care Centre in Delhi's Vivek Vihar cost seven newborns their lives, authorities discovered grave lapses at the medical facility. As per a National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) report, it emerged that the registration certificate of the Baby Care Centre issued on September 30, 2023 in the name of Dr Naveen Khichi had expired on March 31, 2024, but it continued operating, that too with some 'nonqualified' staff. Aditinally, there were no emergency exits in the building, fire extinguishers and fire alarms were not functioning properly, there were no smoke detectors and water sprinkler systems, among others. The police said they would examine the academic degrees of the accused and the documents regarding the registration of the hospital. Several locals living in the neighbourhood have alleged that oxygen cylinder refilling was being done at the hospital. Also, the FIR registered in the matter said that there were 27 oxygen cylinders kept illegally at the facility, five of which exploded during the fire on Saturday night. It was also learnt that Naveen Khichi was also running another nursing home \"illegally\" in West Delhi's Paschimpuri and a case was registered against him. Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Monday swung into action and ordered a fire audit of all the health facilities falling under its ambit in the wake of the grave lapses that emerged at the Baby Care Centre. Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj on Monday held a meeting with state officials and said that all government and private health facilities were required to submit a fire audit report by June 8, 2024. The health facilities would have to furnish details of the installation of smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and water sprinklers, while the Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) has been instructed to conduct sudden and random checks at hospitals and nursing homes. There has also a political slugfest erupted over the fire tragedy with the Delhi BJP alleging that the health minister's OSD had a role in the 'illegal' running of the child care facility. Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said \"The health department, during an inspection in 2021, found the children's hospital capable of admitting five newborns only, but the officer on special duty (OSD) of the health minister on an application of the hospital owner tried to approve its capacity to 10 admissions\". However, Bharadwaj assured that strict action would be taken against the guilty and no one would be spared. He claimed that the BJP was lying, and the hospital was given permission for only five beds.

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail Australia's competition watchdog has approved Sydney -based pet chain PetO's acquisition of more than 60 new stores and vet clinics, allowing it to emerge as a third major player in the industry. Under the deal approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), PetO will﻿ absorb the Best Friends, Our Vet, My Pet Warehouse and Pet City brands. That will see it expand from its current 17 stores ﻿around the Sydney region to 58 across much of the country, as well as adding 25 veterinary clinics, in a move the company says will establish it as a \"clear and credible third player\" in the market.

        "content": "Saudi Gazette Report JEDDAH — Saudi Minister of Health and Chairman of the Traffic Safety Committee Fahd Al-Jalajel said that Saudi Arabia has made great progress in the aspect of traffic safety as it achieved a sharp drop in the number of traffic accident deaths by 50 percent and injury rates by 35 percent. These figures were revealed in a report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023, he pointed out. Al-Jalajel attributed the decrease in accident fatalities and injuries to enhancing the quality of infrastructure and the Kingdom’s compliance with traffic safety standards, apart from contributing factors including technical, legislative, awareness, and health elements. “With all these, Saudi Arabia achieved the global goal of reducing deaths resulting from road accidents by 50 percent in 2023 before the end of the Second United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety in 2030,” the minister noted. Saudi Arabia has doubled its keenness on reducing road accident deaths, as it managed to reduce the rate to 35 percent over the past five years, after the number of road accident deaths declined from 9,311 in 2016 to 6,651 in 2021, the WHO report showed. Traffic safety, in its broad sense, aims to adopt all plans, programs, traffic regulations and preventive measures to curb traffic accidents, and preserve the country’s security and its human and economic capabilities. Data from the General Traffic Department indicate that the rates of loss of national product due to traffic accidents in Saudi Arabia at one time reached 4.7 percent, while it did not exceed 1.7 percent in Australia, England, and America. On the other hand, the size of the economic cost resulting from traffic accident losses is estimated at about SR21 billion annually, as the Traffic Department disclosed on its official website. The General Authority for Roads launched the Saudi Road Code, which is a technical reference for the authorities responsible for roads in Saudi Arabia at all levels, such as ministries, development authorities in the regions, city development authorities, regional mayoralties, municipalities of cities and governorates so as to enable the authorities to access the information necessary for planning, designing, implementation, operation and maintenance of all types of roads in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Road Code includes 25 codes distributed over planning and preliminary studies of roads, as well as the design, implementation and maintenance of roads, bridges and tunnels, in addition to traffic engineering and road safety. There is also a special code for the environmental aspects of roads, with a code allocated to the requirements of self-driving vehicles < Previous Page Next Page >",

        "content": "With a 4-1 record, 0.93 ERA and 38 strikeouts in 29 innings, Garrett Crochet has built a spiffy resume to submit for AL Pitcher of the Month honors. What Crochet’s workload will look like in June, July and beyond bears watching. The White Sox most certainly are watching every pitch. “It’s kind of like [Carlos] Rodon [in 2021, coming back from shoulder and elbow problems], take it outing by outing, see how it is,” pitching coach Ethan Katz said in a recent conversation with the Sun-Times. “At the All-Star break bring him back last, and when we have an extra day give him an extra day and be mindful of stressful innings.” Crochet is a starter for the first time after elbow (Tommy John) and shoulder surgeries derailed his career. And so his workload will be monitored. Katz, Pedro Grifol and the training staff, with input from Crochet, are taking it inning by inning. “If innings are easy, stress is less, those are days we can push him a little,” Katz said. “Those are the conversations we have, check the biochemanics we have, make sure he’s not losing his delivery, watching the radar gun during the game to make sure the velo is good and make the best decisions possible. As we go on,continue to see how things go.” Proponents of a six-man rotation – Tuesday starter Mike Clevinger is among them – that would give Crochet and others an extra day of rest need to consider the impact it would have on the bullpen, cutting the number of relievers from eight to seven. “You have a bullpen to protect,” Katz said. The same goes for using Crochet as an opener for multiple starts as a way of reducing his innings, a possibility the Sox have discussed. An opener pitching two innings is going to require a multi-innings reliever or two as well. “So it’s hard to do those things without other guys getting impacted,” Katz said. In any case, Crochet (5-5, 3.68), the AL leader with 85 strikeouts, is a prized commodity who will be watched. At 63 2/3 innings, he’s already past his career high of 54 1/2 in 2021, all in relief. “You have to be mindful of what you see, what goes on behind the scenes, and rest and recovery,” Katz said. “He does a really good job taking care of himself in the gym, with nutrition, he’s on top of everything.” In May, Crochet ranks third in ERA and first in WHIP and strikeouts among AL pitchers. Nick Nastrini allowed three runs over five innings in his second start since getting recalled from Triple-A Charlotte and his second start against the Blue Jays in six days. In Toronto Wednesday, he was tagged for nine runs (eight earned) in 3 1/3 innings. Nastrini struck out five and allowed three hits but he walked four. He has walked 17 in 16 1/3 innings in his rookie season.",

        "content": "As of Monday, there are less than five weeks left until the start of one of the most controversial programs in the MTA’s history: Congestion pricing will come to New York City. In April the MTA announced Sunday, June 30 as the date the program will take effect. “Starting June 30, 2024, vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone in Manhattan — local streets and avenues at or below 60 Street — will be charged a toll. The toll will result in 100,000 fewer vehicles entering the zone every day, relieving crowding in what is today the most congested district in the United States,” the MTA wrote on its website. If you are planning to drive into Manhattan south of 60th Street (the highways that run up the west and east sides are exempted), be prepared to pay. We have all of the details broken down here , or see rates for cars below. BASE TOLL RATES The base toll for cars will be $15, charged on weekdays from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Tolls will be charged when entering the CBD and will be capped at once per day for passenger vehicles. OVERNIGHT TOLL RATES Toll rates will be discounted by 75% during overnight hours, which are defined as weekdays from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. and weekends from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. Here’s the overnight toll rate for passenger vehicles is $3.75. CROSSING CREDITS Drivers entering the congestion zone via the Queens-Midtown, Hugh L. Carey, Holland, or Lincoln tunnels will be offered crossing credits—and will only be issued during standard daytime tolling hours. Passenger vehicles will get a $5 discoutn. No additional credits would be offered to New Jersey drivers who enter Manhattan via the George Washington Bridge or Staten Islanders who cross the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to enter Brooklyn before moving to Manhattan, something elected officials from both areas have been pushing for.",

        "description": "The only thing Bill Walton loved as much as basketball was music",
        "content": "Every March for many years until their final show there in 2014, The Allman Brothers Band would play several weeks of shows at the Beacon Theatre on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. The dates often overlapped with the Big East Tournament, so it was possible, in a given week, to see a couple of Allmans shows and several nights of college basketball without leaving the West Side of Manhattan. This was my routine for many years, with many friends, across dozens and dozens of shows. One night stands out in particular. I was on the left side of the floor, a few rows off of Gregg Allman’s Hammond B3 organ, and Warren Haynes was doing a soulful cover of Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic.” The good vibes were flowing, the crowd was one with the music and everyone was having a good time. I know I was. I looked over to my right, about 20 yards, and saw a 6-foot-11 redhead with a smile that lit up the orchestra section. Bill Walton was dancing and loving the moment just like everyone else. He towered above the crowd and was hard to miss. That’s where he belonged on that night -- and I feel fortunate that I was there, too. Walton passed away on Monday at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his family. RIP to the man, the myth, the legend, Bill Walton. He was truly one of a kind and always had a moment for others who love basketball. There will never be another like him. pic.twitter.com/UO7FklMmrM He will be remembered as a Naismith Hall of Fame center, a two-time NCAA champion, a two-time NBA champion and a player who changed the game. As a broadcaster for the “Conference of Champions,” he had an infectious personality, an unbridled enthusiasm for Pac-12 history and a penchant for going off-topic to discuss everything from his love for The Grateful Dead to John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd to Dan Hurley. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events – always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. In the last 10 Minutes @BillWalton mentioned John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, Dan Hurley and JR Reid. You really have to pay attention to keep up https://t.co/1xKykgTBxU pic.twitter.com/XSbUVzFrtu “As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill’s wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.” Though Walton, who was born in La Mesa, Calif., loved The Allman Brothers, nothing matched his passion for The Dead -- and later Dead and Company with John Mayer. “It was 1967 when I heard them on the radio in my hometown of San Diego,” he told Variety in 2020 in an article honoring the 25th anniversary of Jerry Garcia’s death. “That was just like, ‘Wow.’ Then the disc jockey was telling a story about how there’s going to the concert. I was 15 years old and me and a couple of my buddies, we just went. We got in, and I got to the front of the stage, and I never left. That was 53 years ago.” He added: “I am who I am because of the Grateful Dead. They have shaped me and formed me and molded me and driven me and inspired me and lifted me up and carried me when I couldn’t walk and taken me to places that I could never get to on my own.” Every year when I saw Walton at the Final Four, I would invariably ask how many summer Dead and Company shows he was planning to see. “Eleven,” he told me in 2018. Sure enough, at almost every Dead or Dead and Company show I went to, Bill was there enjoying the music. He was there at the “Fare Thee Well” shows in Santa Clara in 2015, one of many “farewell” shows for the band. The scene over Levi's Stadium last night for The Grateful Dead where @BillWalton & the rest of had a great night. pic.twitter.com/Xq6beGOsOv He was a fixture at Dead & Company shows I attended in recent years. On New Year’s Eve as the clock turned to 2020 at San Francisco’s Chase Center, Walton dressed as Father Time for a Dead & Company show and appeared alongside Wavy Gravy. On New Year's Day 2020, Bill Walton dressed as Father Time for a Dead show. Here he is w/ Wavy Gravy Whenever I saw Bill at the Final 4, I would ask how many Dead and Co shows he was seeing on the upcoming tour, and he would say something like \"17 of 24\" with a huge smile. https://t.co/o6mmcuy6WF pic.twitter.com/foPamdfkFT Now we can imagine Bill is reuniting with Jerry Garcia, Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts and enjoying a few laughs and some great music.

        "content": "Lawyer and human rights activist Funmi Falana (SAN) discusses the court ruling against Regulations 126 and 127 of the Nigeria Police Force, which allows the dismissal of unmarried pregnant policewomen, with AJIBADE OMAPE What were the specific regulations declared illegal by the Court of Appeal in Abuja regarding the dismissal of unmarried pregnant policewomen? Police Regulation 126 specifies that no woman police officer shall be allowed to get married within the first three years of entering into service, and Regulation 127 now states that if they do, they will be dismissed from police service. However, this regulation specifically targets women police officers, whereas the same is not required of policemen. These regulations were challenged in court. It also happened that one Omalola Olujide, who was a police officer somewhere in Ekiti State Police Command, was dismissed because she became pregnant. So, we went to court last year to challenge those regulations. The court said that the regulations were unconstitutional and violated her rights to freedom from discrimination because any provision that is made in any organisation should be for both men and women. Any provision that targets a woman and does not apply to the male counterpart is inconsistent with the provision of the constitution that says there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex. Such a provision is null and void due to the inconsistency with the Constitution. So the court struck down that provision and declared the dismissal of Omolola Olujide from police service as illegal. Fortunately, the NBA had gone to court initially, but not specifically on the case of Olujide, but they went to court to ask that the regulations 126 and 127 should be struck down, and the court dismissed their application initially at the Federal High Court. So they now filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal granted their application two days ago. I think sometime last week. The court declared that regulations 126 and 127 are inconsistent with the provision of section 42 and of course section 37 of the constitution. Section 37 of the constitution provides that there shall be rights to privacy and that if any woman is deprived of becoming pregnant, that is an infringement on her right to privacy. Of course, if that provision is targeted at female police officers and is not applied to male police officers, it is, again, inconsistent with section 42 which talks about freedom from discrimination. So the Court of Appeal last week granted the application of the NBA and while the Court of Appeal was granting that application, it referred to our own case that was already granted by the Federal High Court last year as an authority that is cited in courts. It affirmed that these provisions are inconsistent with the constitution and they are null and void as to the inconsistency. Can you explain the implications of the court’s decision on Regulations 126 and 127 of the Nigerian Police for unmarried pregnant policewomen? Yes, the implication is that that pronouncement is now a law. This is because, luckily for us in Nigeria, state decisions are one of our sources of law. When I say state decisions, I mean judicial precedent, when an issue goes to court and the court pronounces on that issue. The pronouncement of the court becomes the law on that issue. So as of today, the law in this country regarding police regulations 127 and 126 is that they are expunged from the law because the court has so pronounced that they are inconsistent with the provision of the constitution and they should be struck down. So having been struck down by the court, the implication is that those laws no longer exist. They are no longer part of the police regulation as of today, by virtue of the pronouncement of the decision of the Court of Appeal last week. So that is the implication of that decision and that is the law as of today. Do you see the dismissal of Omolola Olujide as an act of discrimination against women in the police force? The entire police regulations 126 and 127 are inconsistent with the provision of the constitution. They are discriminatory. Those laws are discriminatory against women and it was based on the fact that they are discriminatory against women that they were struck down by the court. So the dismissal of Omolola Olujide is inconsistent with her right to freedom from discrimination and that was what the court held, so the court also ordered that Omolola Olujide be reinstated back in the police force. Now that the court has declared the dismissal illegal, is Omolola Olujide going to be reinstated into the police force? Oh yes, that will be done. When we got this decision of the court’s judgment, we sent it to the Inspector General of Police and the Inspector General of Police replied to us as a lawyer to Omolola Olujide that the police were working on her reinstatement and that Omolola Olujide would be re-absorbed into the police force based on the order of the court, and any act of victimisation of course will also be answerable in court. If anybody victimises her based on her being re-absorbed into the police force, she has a right to challenge that in court again. Can women from other security agencies benefit from this judgment? Yes, they can benefit from it. There are similar provisions in the Immigration Service as well and I think the Nigerian Drug and Law Enforcement Agency. But unfortunately, this particular judgment is specifically on regulations 127 and 126 of the police force. So until such provisions in other sister organisations, and other security organisations are taken to court, they may not be able to take benefit from it. But such provisions in other security organisations could be challenged in court and this case will be referred to in court as a precedent or as a judicial precedent. The court will now take cognisance of this particular rule to strike down the other provisions. But because most of the provisions are not specifically mentioned, in this decision, they may not be able to take the direct benefit. Until we take their provisions to court and the court makes pronouncement of them, they may not be able to take the benefit of this provision because the court specifically mentioned police regulation.” Do you believe the same police regulation should have applied to male police officers who aren’t married but get women pregnant? Of course, that was our argument in court. We said if you are saying a woman should not get married and should not become pregnant, what happens to a policeman who impregnates another woman? A man and a woman should be treated equally. So if a condition specifies that a woman should be so treated, the male counterparts should also be so treated, that was our argument. But unfortunately, you will agree with me that every day men impregnate women and nobody gets to know because men do not carry pregnancies. When I was arguing this case in court, I told the court that of course the person who impregnated Omolola Olujide is a man and he’s a police officer who is still in police service, and the woman, because of this same pregnancy was dismissed. This is discriminatory. Can you elaborate on the Court of Appeal’s reasoning behind the ruling in favour of the Nigeria Bar Association? The reason is that discrimination has been expunged from the law in all civilised communities. Also, the constitution of Nigeria, which we call the ground law specifically mentions in section 42 that nobody shall be discriminated against on the basis of sex and of course on place of origin. Now, if regulations 127 and 126 are placed side by side, and juxtaposed with section 42, they cannot stand. They cannot stand if they are juxtaposed with section 42 of the constitution because any provision that is made in any organisation should apply to both men and women. If they do not apply to both men and women, then they become discriminatory, and so the court said this type of law cannot stand in any civilised community, and our country should not be an exception. So the court ordered that the organisations involved should take steps to expunge this from the regulation. Now, perhaps I should let you know that there is also another regulation which is Regulation 124. What that specifies is that a woman should not get married within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force unless she takes the permission of her superior officer, and in obtaining that permission of the supervising officer, she must bring the would-be husband, before the supervising officer for approval. That’s section 124, and that we took to court some years ago, Women Empowerment and Legal Aid versus Attorney General of the Federation. So that case was handled by my own organisation, my NGO. I went to court on behalf of my NGO to tell the court that such a provision of the law cannot stand in the face of section 42, because a man who enters into the police force could get married and not have to bring his own fiancé before the superior officer, but the woman will be compelled, otherwise, she will be dismissed from the police force. So we went to court and the court said that provision was inconsistent with the provision of the constitution and it was struck that down. So three provisions have been struck down by the court now. Provision 124, and that was in the case of Women Empowerment and Legal Aid versus Attorney General of the Federation, and that was in the year 2011. It was struck down based on the fact that it was inconsistent with section 42 of the constitution. Also, regulations 126 and 127 were equally struck down based on the same reason. Now the reason for the two, of course, is the fact that those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is null and void as to the level and the extent of its inconsistency. How does the court’s judgment address the issue of privacy and discrimination against female police officers within the Nigerian Police Force? Yes, section 37 provides that every person shall have the right to privacy. In other words, you have the right to determine when to get married, who to get married to, when to have a baby, and when not to have a baby. As a matter of fact, the extension of that law is the third-generation rights we call the reproductive rights of women. The reproductive rights of women go further to give you the right to decide who to get married to, and when to get married, who to be your partner, and who not to be your partner. So these are the rights to privacy, and by extension, the reproductive rights of women. So the court now held that any law that takes away this right to privacy is inconsistent with the provision of the constitution. Such a law violates one’s right to privacy, and it cannot stand in the face of any law in any civilised community. What was the court’s position on the principles of morality, discipline, and gender equality in its judgment? Yes, the police argued that they were trying to protect women, and of course, they were also trying to protect the police force from abuse. In other words, a woman who becomes pregnant may not be able to function properly. They also argued that the women knew that this provision existed when they were applying to join the police force, and they should have opted to say, I don’t want to go into the police force because of that. They noted that having seen the provision and still went ahead to join the police force, they must have waived their rights. That was the argument of the police. The court addressed that by saying, that any law that is a law cannot be waived, especially the rights under the Constitution. Morality is different from law, a law is a law and must be obeyed, especially when it is the provision of the Constitution. It cannot be waived by any person, and so, the argument that they waived their rights, or the argument that they are trying to defend or morally protect the police force cannot stand in the face of the provision of the Constitution. What are the broader implications of this court decision for the Nigerian Police Force and its regulations? The implication is that all these provisions that have been specified would be expunged from their law, they cease to become part of the law, and so, a woman can now become pregnant within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force without any punitive measure. They also can get married within the first three years of being absorbed by the police force without any penalty. Because all these laws that prohibit these actions have been taken away by the decision of the court. So, they cease to be part of the laws of the land. That is the implication. How does this judgment align with the demands of a modern society operating under the rule of law, as mentioned by the Court of Appeal? Yes, that was one of the objectives of the court, that they honour the rule of law, and the rule of law specifically says that everybody shall be equal before the law. That is one of the terms of the rule of law. So, any law that discriminates against any person or gender, any gender-biased law is inconsistent with the rule of law, and that was what the court said. In any modern society, when we talk about the rule of law, the cardinal number one point, everybody shall be equal before the law. Number two, you must give the other side a fair hearing, and number three is that you cannot be a judge in your own cause. The judgment of the court must be obeyed. These are the cardinals of the rule of law, and the primary cardinal is that everybody shall be equal before the law. The law does not see anybody as being superior to the other. That is what we call the rule of law. So, any law that discriminates is inconsistent with the cardinals of the rule of law, and cannot stand in any modern society. Nigeria must obey the rule of law, and Nigeria must allow its laws and the provisions of their laws to be consistent with the cardinals of the rule of law as being operated in modern societies.” What steps are expected to be taken by the respondents following this court ruling? The court specifically ordered the police force to take steps to expunge these provisions from their law, and that means the Police Service Commission and the Attorney General will take steps to expunge this from their laws.",

        "content": "By Edwin Mbewe LILONGWE-(MaraviPost)- The Malawi Football Legends on Sunday, May 26, 2024, stormed the magnificent Bingu International Convention Centre to grace the launch of “Ndimamvetsera Kumwamba” by Ndilande Anglican Voices. The President of the J.K Production Board, Jim Kalua, the organization that looks after the welfare of the legends says attending the event was pivotal for the legends, “This is very important to be part of this event, you know for these legends to reach thus far, it has been only God hence whatever we do we believe in Him” “As legends, we will be attending such events to support our colleagues. This is also one way of sending the message that the legends who had put the Malawian flag on the map still exist and need corporate world support”, Kalua said. The former Flames coach Kinnah Phiri described the event as colorful and hence hailed organizers and also the J.K Productions together with Legends Association for making it possible for them to attend. ” This is a very big thing to us because it’s a spiritual thing, and we feel that we have an obligation as legends to attend such. We are motivated and encouraged. Let me take this opportunity to urge all youths in the country with different careers to put on the number so that they succeed”, Eluded Phiri. Another legend Peterkins Kayira hailed the organisers and J.K. production saying the event is in line with their organization policy which is encouraging each other spiritually. “You know we are being assisted left, right, and center and why can it be possible for us to fail to assist others. We are Holly touched here with the gospel music being performed. As legends we have gone through a lot to be at this stage and without God, others could not be here by now”, added Kayira. Ndilande Anglican Voices choir leader, Dennis Kilambe hailed the legends for their support. The occasion was also graced by the former President of Malawi, Joyce Banda, and his husband Retired Chief Justice Richard Banda, Kondwani Nankhumwa, Deputy Reserve Bank governor Dr. Mafuta Mwale who both bought the launched Album at K1 million each.

        "content": "The Helix High, UCLA and NBA basketball star grew into an unmatched philanthropist who became the ‘soul’ of San Diego If you felt wetness on your shoulder or saw it on a windshield Monday, those were the tears of San Diego mourning the unimaginable and unshakable loss of a man who defied convention or explanation. Bill Walton was a basketball player by the narrowest definition only, despite being one of the best to ever lace up sneakers. Walton, who died Monday at 71 after a prolonged battle with cancer, was a tireless, unstoppable freight train of cosmic good. He gushed about his beloved San Diego, but also books ... and music ... and sunshine. He taught us to celebrate the day, the hour and the minute. He was, as he reminded us over and again, the luckiest guy in the world. The truth behind his truth: We were the lucky ones. “There are no words,” said Lucky Duck Foundation co-founder Pat Kilkenny, the former Oregon athletic director who became a trusted friend. “He defied words. He defied characterization. There was one of him and there will never be another one. He was an absolute treasure.” One of one. Walton was as unexplainable as he was unguardable. How can someone be so humble? So inclusive? So giving? So kind? So ... good ? He was the big redhead with the exponentially bigger heart. Kilkenny said Walton and his wife Lori supported more than 100 charities . In reality, it was impossible to count and track. When I asked Bill to come up with an exact figure one time, he shrugged. It would have been more possible to count grains of sand along Pacific Beach. He just said yes. Again and again and again. It seemed as if he would say yes until the world’s problems were buttoned up, spit polished and basking in his cherished coastal rays. Walton was San Diego’s 6-foot-11 chamber of commerce. He was the city’s champion, its cheerleader and, in many ways, its very soul. “He wrote checks and checks and checks,” Kilkenny said. “His time was invaluable, but Lori and him brought the checkbook, too. Nobody does that. If the expectation to be at an event was 30 minutes, he would stay an hour and a half to make sure he was able to talk to everyone. “We don’t have anyone who is a bellwether for humanity more than Bill Walton.” Editorials As a basketball player, he was sublime, until slowed by injuries. But he was an iconoclastic, distinct presence off the court as well, in his broadcasting and activism. When a bronze statue of Walton and his prized bike was unveiled in 2016 , I wrote something that remains just as true today as it was then: “In many ways — with apologies to the world-class zoo and fish tacos — Bill Walton is the most San Diego thing about San Diego.” When the ceremony ended, Walton jumped on that bike to lead a memorial ride to honor military veterans. Because of course he did. “His enthusiasm and energy is so unparalleled,” late broadcasting icon and friend Dick Enberg, who called many of Walton’s games on TV at UCLA, told me then. “Athletes usually aren’t very good about giving back, because they’re trained to take all their life. Few get it and realize that the real honor is to give back to your community. Bill relishes that. “He was kind of a flower child at UCLA, and he’s blossomed into a beautiful man. It’s the real deal.” Visual storytelling Bill Walton, the Helix High School basketball great who became a San Diego city icon in retirement, has died, the NBA said. May 27, 2024 Walton was unarguably one of the best to hold a basketball, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated 14 times. He became a star at Helix High School, the mountain on the mountain. He was a late cornerstone in UCLA’s dominant championship run of the 1960s and ‘70s. On March 26, 1973, Walton scored an NCAA title game record 44 points as UCLA steamrolled Memphis State 87-66 for its seventh straight title and 75th win in a row. Walton drained 21 of 22 shots and unofficially 25 of 26 because four were disallowed became of the no-dunking rule at the time. Sports Illustrated labeled it the No. 9 most impressive college sports feat of all time. And he never watched it. It was as telling a moment about Walton as you can mine. “I don’t like to read about myself. I don’t like to watch myself,” Walton told me in his Balboa Park-adjacent home. “That’s just not me. I like to get on to what’s next.” Though Walton was a two-time NBA champion — once with the Portland Trail Blazers, again with the Boston Celtics , the league’s 1978 MVP — he refused to let athletic greatness define him. As a polarizing broadcaster, wandering into the weeds on a sea of topics that left the court far behind, he could not separate life from the games we play. He waxed, poetically and endlessly. Basketball, though, never came close to approaching the depth of the man. The son of a social worker and librarian became a beacon for education and empathy, decency and grace. He became a role model for untold people paralyzed by crippling stuttering. Once he found his voice, he never let go of it. His late brother Bruce once told me with a laugh, “Once he started to talk, he never stopped.” He also mastered the quiet kindnesses in the shadows. A friend of mine, Kevin McNamara, told me Monday that Walton, who did not know him at the time, had heard through acquaintances that he was suffering through horrific back pain. Walton, who battled his own physical demons, called McNamara out of the blue to check on his health, his mental well-being and more. Not long after the conversation, the phone rang. It was Walton’s surgeon at UC San Diego, saying he would clear an immediate appointment if needed. Bill had called him, too. For months, Walton kept calling to check in. “Just incredibly kind,” McNamara said. “He didn’t have to do that.” That was Walton. That’s what San Diego and far beyond has lost. The world is bit less bright. A bit less warm. A whole lot less interesting. Those tears? They’re ours. And they’re forever.",

The King of Clay may have bowed out but the Queen of Clay is still in power, with Iga Swiatek through to round two as she bids for a third straight title and a fourth in five years. Here, the PA news agency looks back at day two at the French Open. Still got it! Away from Nadal there were comfortable wins for Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Ons Jabeur. But there was a tense first-round encounter between two former top three players, with Elina Svitolina coming from behind to beat Karolína Plískova. Another bad day as Cameron Norrie’s five-set demise to Russian Pavel Kotov was quickly followed by a straight-sets defeat for Harriet Dart against Linda Noskova. It leaves only two Brits standing in singles, Dan Evans and Katie Boulter. Women: Maria Sakkari (6), Ekatarina Alexandrova (16). Men: Cameron Norrie (32). Novak Djokovic begins his title defence in the night session against French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Brits Evans and Boulter are in action late in the afternoon against Holger Rune and Paula Badosa respectively.",

        "description": "‘I may have come for a job, but every day that I’m here, I feel more and more at home.’",
        "content": "Why Chilliwack? The only question that seemed to follow when sharing the news that I had taken a job and would be leaving the stability of a position with the country’s biggest sports network. The stability of a familiar environment I had known most of my life. The stability of my friends, my family, and really everything that I had ever known in my soon-to-be 25 years of life. The simple answer – because I wanted to, and I could. Now one could certainly argue I was a bit overambitious having accepted a job not only in a city, but a province I’d never visited. To be completely honest, I’d never in my life stepped foot west of Ontario. The realization of that truly hit me as I stood, chilled to the bone, waiting for a rental car about two blocks away from the Vancouver airport on a cold and rainy day at the beginning of March. As I looked around an environment so foreign to me, you could have told me we were in Finland had it not been for all the English writing and a lone Canadian flag violently flapping through the rainy gusts. ‘Change is good, and it’s what you’ve been after,’ is what I kept telling myself as maps steered me through a wet Trans-Canada highway while Fly At Night by the band Chilliwack played through the speakers. Without them, I would have probably gone my whole life not knowing this city even existed. But as I approached the city limits, I was overcome with a settling sense of peace. The way the road curved around the land giving way to mountain after mountain. The way the clouds wrapped themselves around the lower peaks like scarves. It was incredibly magnetizing, I just couldn’t look away. I pulled off the highway onto Vedder Road and drove towards what would be my new home. And as I stepped out of the car, I was shocked by what I heard. Nothing. The constant buzz of highway traffic was replaced by wind passing through trees starting to wake up from a winter nap. The scream of sirens I was accustomed to hearing every 20 minutes were replaced by ... well, nothing. The noise pollution from a city with over four million people is one you don’t even realize exists until you’re gone. Something just felt right. This is where I was supposed to be. The two-and-a-half days I spent in Chilliwack were the first I’d ever spent in Western Canada, but there wasn’t a doubt in my mind I was making the right decision. I landed back in Toronto counting down the 22 days that remained until it was time to do the drive back out for good. 4,300 kilometres, four motels, an unhealthy amount of takeout food and five days later, I finally made it back. And once again that feeling of serenity washed over me as I entered the city limits. I may have come for a job, but every day that I’m here, I feel more and more at home. Waking up and stepping out on my balcony to stare at the view — the best $25 extra a month I’ve ever spent — while sipping my coffee is truly the best way to start your day. But I would be remiss to not mention the people of Chilliwack. Kind, caring and welcoming in a way I’ve never experienced before. Whether it be to my coworkers who seemed just as excited as I for me to begin, or the stranger who let me go first at a four-way stop sign with a warm smile and gentle wave. It’s the small gestures that may be overlooked here, but are noticeable for someone like myself coming from a place where those seem to be lacking. It’s the overwhelming sense of pride that exists through the members of the community. One that I look forward to integrating myself into. So to the people of Chilliwack, I say thank you for how you have welcomed me. And in return, I will do my duty to learn. To learn about our community, and listen to all the voices that come together to make up the collective. You all have stories to tell, and I’m ready to listen.",

        "content": "REBUS is set to bring another tourist boom to Edinburgh - after the international success of the TV detective reboot. Outlander star Richard Rankin has proved to be a smash hit as a more “macho” investigating copper who takes on the capital’s underworld, after the role was originally played on ITV by John Hannah and Ken Stott. 6 Richard Rankin plays a younger version of the detective 6 Edinburgh is the setting for the dark new reboot And TV critics have been full of praise for the new series, including our own Ally Ross who described it as “superb” and like being “embraced like a long-lost friend”. VisitScotland has since seen interest soar for the BBC drama - which is also streamed around the world by Swedish streaming service Viaplay - and have now put together a list of Rebus filming locations . Chief Features Writer MATT BENDORIS takes a look at Edinburgh through the eyes of the maverick detective. GRASSMARKET THE Old Town of Edinburgh is the perfect backdrop for the new Rebus series with its twisting cobbled streets and hidden closes. READ MORE IN TV 'TEC OFF Twenty actors have played Rebus with an EastEnders legend once touted for the role SEX BAN Ian Rankin says he was banned from writing Rebus sex scenes in early books 6 Edinburgh's Grassmarket area Fittingly this was once the location for public executions, when people used to gather for open-air marketplaces and a hanging. Now the Grassmarket is a bustling spot full of independent shops , cafés and pubs that date back to the 18th century, all with epic views of Edinburgh Castle . THE MOUND AS its name suggests, The Mound is a steep hill connecting Edinburgh’s Old and New Towns, with incredible views of Princes Street and its gardens. This filming location reflects the detective’s complex character, as well as the duality of Edinburgh’s shifting landscapes.

NATIONAL LIBRARY OF SCOTLAND REBUS’S partner Detective Constable Siobhan Clarke (Lucie Shorthouse) is seen entering the front entrance of the library for a clandestine meeting. Rebus trailer Centrally located on George IV Bridge off the Royal Mile, the architecture of the building is impressive inside and out. The research archive date back to the 17th century and Rebus author Ian Rankin, 63, even donated his entire archive to the library. THE MEADOWS EAGLE-eyed viewers will have spotted this beautiful, open green space in the south of the city in the first episode of the new series. 6 The Meadows feature in episode one And while the detective was enjoying a secret rendezvous, visitors can instead have a drink and a snack from some of the nearby artisan coffee trucks. The Meadows also offers a chance to explore the picturesque neighbourhoods of Bruntsfield and Marchmont. GEORGE HERIOT’S SCHOOL THIS impressive building of academic prowess is where Rebus’s daughter Sammy (Mia McKenzie) goes to school . 6 There's claims the school inspired Hogwarts It’s not the first time it has been associated with fiction with Harry Potter fans claiming it also inspired J.K. Rowling’s school for wizards Hogwarts. Founded in the 1600s the best view of George Heriot’s, with its renaissance architecture, elaborate turrets and sandstone façade, is actually from Greyfriars Kirkyard. EDINBURGH CASTLE THE new series wasn’t actually filmed inside the castle walls, but the 11th century fortress acts as a backdrop throughout all six episodes . Edinburgh Castle has also been at the centre of Scottish history for over a millenia and was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. In fact research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been, “The most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world.” OXFORD BAR THIS is not only Rebus’s local, but it’s also the favourite watering hole of his creator Sir Ian Rankin. 6 The bar is also one of author Ian Rankin's haunts The 63-year-old author, who will release his 25th and possibly last Rebus book this year, has been a customer for over 30 years and once considered buying the bar on Young Street. Fans trying to contact him regularly send letters to the pub, which Ian retrieves from behind the bar whenever he pops in for a pint. ROYAL MILE RUNNING between Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse this cobblestoned road is probably the best known in the capital. Each year millions of tourists line the street to check out the good and the bad of the Edinburgh Festival street performers.

        "content": "In a rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600, is there anything that we can take away from the weekend as far as the NASCAR Power Rankings go? Judging things based on the 373.5 miles that we saw on the track on Sunday, there are a few changes this week. The NASCAR Power Rankings here at 5GOATs took a week off during the All-Star Race week. There really isn’t anything to parse from the North Wilkesboro race, especially with the different tires and the rules surrounding the event. This week, fresh off of the race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, there are a few changes. That includes one driver being kicked from the rankings entirely and another coming back into the fold. Let’s get into it. 1. Kyle Larson – Hendrick Motorsports (-) Qualifying P5 in the Indy 500 is enough for me to keep Kyle Larson here. He didn’t turn a lap in the Coca-Cola 600 due to weather but he’s clearly the most talented driver in the field. Until this team starts to bring slow cars to the track, others outperform them on a regular basis, or the DNF monster comes to bite Larson again – I’m sticking with Yung Money, even if he lost the points lead . 2. Denny Hamlin – Joe Gibbs Racing (-) Three wins on the season and Denny Hamlin keeps running up front. Four top-5 finishes in a row dating back to his Dover win. That is impressive. Hamlin is consistent, he is fast each week. He finished P2 last year at Gateway, another win could be on the horizon. 3. William Byron – Hendrick Motorsports (-) A good week for William Byron as he finished P3 at Charlotte. After P33 at Dover and P23 at Kansas, I got a little worried about Byron. In the last two weeks, he has bounced back with a P6 and P3 finish. Those three wins are doing a lot for him as well. 4. Chase Elliott – Hendrick Motorsports (-) To round out the unchanging top-four in the NASCAR Power Rankings, Chase Elliott retains his spot. P7 on the night with a decent amount of points, Elliott keeps showing up and putting down fast laps. Among the Hendrick “Big 3” Elliott is the most quiet and arguably most consistent right now. It feels weird to say but he’s a sneaky pick for champion right now. I like him laying low. 5. Brad Keselowski – RFK Racing (+3) I’m moving Brad up because he has been doing a great job lately. Four top-5 finishes, including the Darlington win, in the last six races and he isn’t showing signs of letting up. If Keselowski falters at Gateway and Sonoma, we may have to revisit this. But right now, the 6 team is showing up with speed. 6. Alex Bowman – Hendrick Motorsports (-1) Five straight top-10 finishes from Alex Bowman, but no winning speed to speak of, really. We don’t know what might have happened in the full 600 miles, but I’m skeptical of Bowman’s ability to win. Dropping one spot this week in the NASCAR Power Rankings. However, I don’t expect him to fall much further unless the floor comes out from under this 48 team. 7. Tyler Reddick – 23XI Racing (-) For the 23XI Racing camp, last night was tough. That race ending early was bad news for Tyler Reddick and Bubba Wallace . Each had speed and a chance at a top-5. Reddick did earn a P4 finish. He is getting back to his usual ways and that is good for his team. He has to be consistent in this summer stretch or he will lose touch with the leaders. He’s safe in the NASCAR Power Rankings, for now. 8. Martin Truex Jr. – Joe Gibbs Racing (-2) Another driver I worry about as far as winning speed goes – Martin Truex Jr. Finishes of P25 and P12 in the last two races are not helping his case, either. This is recency bias, but I’m worried about seeing a season like 2022 again from this 19 team. This next stretch of three races should be good for Truex, I’d like to see improvement. 9. Christopher Bell – Joe Gibbs Racing (NR) Back in the NASCAR Power Rankings, Christopher Bell! Two wins now on the year , I have to have him on this list. Consistency has been a major problem, but maybe that is starting to change now. The summer months are very critical for this team as well. Sink or swim heading towards the playoffs. Unless he pulls another great run out from his firesuit – Bell loves the pressure. 10. Ty Gibbs – Joe Gibbs Racing (-1) I am leaving Ty Gibbs here because I think he had a good performance at Charlotte. Pole award and a strong race until it was called off. Gibbs is young and has a lot to learn, but his raw speed and talent are all there. He has a real chance at spoiling the playoffs for a number of other drivers if he starts to win some races in the next few weeks. Ryan Blaney out of NASCAR Power Rankings So, the defending NASCAR champion has fallen from my Power Rankings for the first time this season I believe. At least the first time since he made an appearance. That is because of a lack of consistency lately. The DNF last night was the final straw. There was just no more justifying having Blaney there. He could totally turn things around and compete for another championship, but right now Team Penske does not look like the defending back-to-back champions.

        "description": "The founder of Chuck E. Cheese, Nolan Bushnell, has more than one thing on his resume. Some of what he's accomplished over the years might surprise you.",
        "content": "Chuck E. Cheese is one of those places that, if we weren't already familiar with it, would sound like a fever dream. A combination of video game arcade, pizza place, and play place, all with animatronic animals in the background? It really feels like something out of a movie rather than real life. Nevertheless, it was the favored spot for '90s kids birthday parties, and incredibly, even today. Turns out there are a lot of , but they all eventually come back to the same question: Where did Chuck E. Cheese come from in the first place? There are all sorts of twists and turns in the chain's legendarily weird origin story, but one key fact that seems truly bizarre in retrospect is who created the chain in the first place: Nolan Bushnell. Though he's the creator of Chuck E. Cheese, Bushnell's even greater mark on society is in another industry entirely — he co-founded Atari. Yes, that Atari, the one that essentially created the home video games market as it exists today. Bushnell's original concepts were different Nolan Bushnell's original inspiration for the chain, as he , came from ancient history: \"[...] celebration had food, drink, and games, without exception. Whether you were talking about the summer solstice with primitive man to the circuses in Rome. There was always an entertainment element. I always felt that was something that was lacking in restaurants.\" But how do you get from pagan solstice rituals to an animatronic mouse? The Disney corporation, apparently, as Bushnell was inspired by the Tiki Room at Disneyland, which already had animatronic parrots. He didn't go straight from parrots to mice, either, as his first idea was to call it \"Coyote Pizza.\" To this end, he ordered a full body costume that he thought was a coyote — only when it arrived, the costume turned out to be a rat. Bushnell rolled with it, theming his around the same concept. The original tone and tenor of the animatronics was also, uh ... different. The first animatronic Chuck E. was a cigar-smoking New Jersey insult comic who made jokes laden with sexual innuendo. Not exactly suitable material for children, but that's not even the strangest thing Bushnell came up with for his signature character. Chuck E. Cheese's backstory is pretty grim The backstory for Chuck E. Cheese's signature character is surprisingly dark. Charles Entertainment Cheese (his actual official name) was apparently raised in an orphanage called St. Marinara's and did not know his own birthday. This, we are told, is why he enjoys celebrating other children's birthdays so much. He eventually aged out of the orphanage and wound up homeless on the streets of New York City, where he took refuge in a pizza parlor. The owner eventually caught him, and would have killed him if he hadn't started singing. These are all part of the actual Chuck E. Cheese backstory to this day — though it's not clear if this story was Nolan Bushnell's, or was created later. For as odd as Chuck E. Cheese feels now, it's even weirder to think that Bushnell's original ideas for him were even stranger. But, maybe that's what happens when you conceptualize a carnival-themed pizza restaurant at the same time as starting the modern day video game industry.",

        "content": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), says its tower T290, one of the four new towers erected by its contractors along the Jos – Gombe... By Daily Trust The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), says its tower T290, one of the four new towers erected by its contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330 Kilo Volt (kV} transmission line, collapsed during the cable stringing process. Mrs Ndidi Mbah, TCN’S General Manager, Public Affairs in a statement in Abuja said the incident occurred at about 7am Monday (Today). Mbah said the incident occurred while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final joining of the power cable in time for energising of the line today. ”In spite the security challenges in the area, TCN contractors and some of our engineering staff worked tirelessly to fast-track the project, doing all that was humanly possible to meet the timeline. Adamawa Govt declares 3-day mourning for ex-EFCC boss Lamorde, lawmaker ECOWAS begins resilience, security assessment in Nigeria ”Every day, the contractor, TCN engineers accompanied by security operatives consistently left the site by 10pm and resumed work at 6am. ”Constructing towers and stringing power cables at such heights is highly technical, although TCN contractors and staff have completed similar projects in other parts of the country. ”The collapse of the fourth tower is a significant setback, given the extensive efforts to ensure that the May 27 power restoration timeline was met,” she said. Mbah said that TCN contractor was currently dismantling the collapsed tower members to enable reconstruction and final restringing of the cable.

After spotting that the 45-year-old was wearing a tiny frock, they just knew this spelt trouble. Taryn Charles, who was Alesha's fellow judge Bruno Tonioli golden buzzer act took to the stage showcasing her incredible vocal range once again. After blowing away the star-studded panel, they couldn't help but rise to their feet. The former rapper, excitedly sprang from her seat, forgetting she was wearing a mega minidress. Fortunately, she managed to adjust herself just in time before the camera could catch a small glimpse of her underwear. Fans watching at home noticed that she managed to pull down her frock just in time, one person wrote: \"That was close Alesha. Nice save.\" A second user penned: \"Alesha is your dress a bit short? #BritainsGotTalent.\" While a third person chimed in with: \"#BritainsGotTalent #bgt Alesha was lucky she didn't reveal something when she stood up.\" Taryn Charles took to the stage to sing Teddy Swims' Lose Control and received a standing ovation from the judges. Bruno was amazed as he told her she gave \"soul\" and \"emotion\" in her performance. Alesha told her: \"How do you follow that?\" Meanwhile, it wasn't just Alesha's outfit catching attention on social media, in fact it was her hair that also saw fans taking to the comments section to chime praise. The former hitmaker donned a new hairdo for the semi-finals switching up her normal raven coloured locks for vibrant red. And online users were loving it.

        "description": "Ranking the highest goalscorers in football history, including Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
        "content": "has produced some of the best athletes the world has ever seen over the years, but the players who capture the public imagination best tend to be those who are capable of scoring goal after goal on the biggest stage. Be it at World Cups, in the , the , or any other major competition, glory is so often reserved for those who step up and stick the ball in the back of the net when it matters most. The game's greatest goal-getters have been made up of prolific poachers, aerial artists and talented technicians. They have been spread across the last century, sharing little in common aside from the shape of the ball which has invariably ended in the back of the net. Soccer is a sport where fans have enjoyed countless world-class finishers. Putting aside points for style and success, here is a list of the sport's best scorers based purely on the number of goals they racked up for club and country. Only goals from domestic and international football at the highest level are considered. Anything from the second tier or below is ignored. Highest-Scoring Men's Football Players 1. Cristiano Ronaldo Portugal 893* 2. Lionel Messi Argentina 833* 3. Pele Brazil 762 4. Romario Brazil 755 5. Ferenc Puskas Hungary, Spain 729 6. Josef Bican Austria, Czechoslovakia 720 7. Jimmy Jones Northern Ireland 647 8. Gerd Muller Germany 634 9. Robert Lewandowski Poland 629* 10. Eusebio Portugal 619 11. Joe Bambrick Northern Ireland 616 *Ronaldo, Messi and Lewandowski are still playing An unfamiliar name features first on this list. Joe Bambrick scored at an alarming rate, managing 616 goals in official matches throughout his career. The Northern Irishman once scored 50 times in a single league campaign for Linfield, in 1930/31, and also played for Glentoran, and Walsall. Bambrick netted the only goal for the Blues in their 1-1 draw with in October 1935, which just so happened to be the club's highest-ever attended match at with 82,905 watching on from the stands. On the international stage, he made just 11 appearances for the Ireland national football team (which selected players from the whole of Ireland until 1950) but scored 12 goals, including six in one match against . The , as Eusebio was otherwise known, played for nine clubs and scored a total of 619 goals across his career, but he is best remembered for petrifying defences in the red of . For the Eagles, he netted an astonishing , helping the side to 11 Portuguese titles and the 1961/62 European Cup. Eusebio also scored goals in Mozambique for Sporting Clube de Lourenco Marques, as well as in Mexico, the USA and for other clubs in Portugal. For his country, he scored 41 in 64 matches. His Golden Boot-winning display at the 1966 World Cup secured his side a bronze medal, which remains their best-ever finish in the competition. He also scooped the Ballon d'Or award in 1965. Robert Lewandowski's father predicted big things for his newborn son. Lewandowski Sr chose 'Robert' so his son's name would be easy to recognise and pronounce for an international audience. Countless commentators certainly owe him a debt of gratitude considering how frequently they have had to scream his child's name in recognition of yet another goal. During his time at Bayern Munich, Lewandowski's teammate Thomas Muller revealed the Pole's fitting nickname of 'LewanGOALski'. Whatever you want to call him, one of had a slow start to life in the Bundesliga before hitting his stride at Borussia Dortmund in 2011. Lewandowski managed to extend his staggering peak for more than a decade with a dedicated approach to nutrition and training, searching for any fine margin to gain. The Barcelona striker is so detail-orientated that he sleeps on his left side to protect his favoured right leg. Robert Lewandowski holds the record for most Bundesliga goals in a single season, netting 41 in 29 games for Bayern Munich during the 2020/21 campaign. Gerd Muller may not have been the most technical or elegant centre-forward to grace the game, but he made being in the right place at the right time an art form, and that is shown by his remarkable 634 career goals. 'Der Bomber' is record goalscorer with 523 goals, and is in the competition's history, boasting 365 strikes. Only Miroslav Klose has scored more for Germany, and Muller is also third on the all-time list of World Cup marksmen. He saw out his career with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers, scoring 38 times in 71 NASL outings and hung up his boots with four Bundesliga titles, four German Cups, three European Cups, a World Cup, a European Championship, and the 1970 Ballon d'Or under his belt. Quite the trophy cabinet. Surprisingly, Jones is the second Northern Irishman to appear on this list with 647 goals. He spent most of his career in his homeland and was close to unstoppable. His best spell came at Glenavon, where he topped the Irish League goalscoring charts in six separate seasons across an 11-year period. Jones remains the leading goalscorer in the history of the Irish League football. He won a total of 17 trophies across his time with Belfast Celtic and Glenavon. Jones was also prolific in Wales and elsewhere in his homeland. At Belfast Celtic, he netted 27 goals in 19 matches before during an encounter between the two sides. That incident kept Jones on the sidelines for 15 months after leg-saving surgery, making his feats even more remarkable. Whether in Austria, his country of birth, or Czechoslovakia, his adopted homeland, defences found Josef Bican to be a constant menace. He remained prolific even during the Second World War when many of his football rivals were at war. He did once claim that he had , which is a little fanciful, but among Bican's undisputed achievements are his three seven-goal haul matches, his streak of strikes in 19 consecutive top-tier games and his five years back-to-back as the world's leading goalscorer – a record that still stands to this day. He also remains . To get an idea of how good Ferenc Puskás was, he . The attack-minded player was the star of the show that day, scoring two of his 729 official career goals in a stunning performance. 'The Galloping Major', as he was affectionately known, first earned prominence at Budapest Honvéd, where he was the Hungarian first division's top scorer on four occasions. Then in 1956, he joined arguably the first incarnation of 's Galacticos and dominated Europe alongside the likes of Francisco Gento, Alfredo Di Stefano and Raymond Kopa. During his time in the capital, he won five consecutive titles and three European Cups. Unsurprisingly, he is still Hungary's record goalscorer, and FIFA even named a trophy after him in 2009, with the scorer of each year's best goal receiving . eventually became the face of Brazilian football in Europe, but Romario paved the way for his natural successor. The striker turned out for 10 clubs, including , and , and netted an astonishing 755 goals across his career. Although it is with his first two clubs that he is best remembered. A strong record for Vasco da Gama convinced Dutch side PSV to capture his services, and Romario repaid their faith, scoring almost a goal a game across five seasons. He helped PSV to three league titles and KNVB Cups in that time as well. He then fired Barcelona to the 1994 La Liga title and continued to strike a healthy goalscoring rate back in his homeland and across the globe later on in his career. Only , , and Ronaldo have than 'Baixinho' (The Little One). The king of football, Pele is still, for some, and boasted 762 goals throughout his glittering career. His heyday of the 1950s and 1960s, before records were meticulously kept, makes it challenging to keep track of all his goals – with many believing he actually – but we do know he is . Twelve of his 77 Selecao strikes came at the World Cup, of which he won three – a record that is unlikely ever to be matched, never mind surpassed. Other than a short spell as the star attraction of the NASL with New York Cosmos, Pele spent his whole career in his homeland, where he also won six Brazilian Serie A titles and two Copa Libertadores. The legendary striker held the world record for most goals scored for about 30 years until a new era dawned. Two men have dominated the goalscoring charts for the bulk of the 21st century. The first of the duo on this list is maestro . 'El Pulga' (The Flea) has picked up a record six European Golden Shoes throughout his career, is Barcelona and La Liga's record goalscorer, while no other player in history has managed more than his , achieved in 2012. He also leads the way in terms of goals for his country, and his performances have been recognised by . And to think all that would not have come to pass without growth hormone treatment, as his short stature as a child threatened to derail his future professional career. In 2022, as he won the World Cup for the first time in his career, netting seven goals in Qatar and picking up the Best Player award. His rival Messi may have more Ballon d'Or awards, but can console himself with his status as the most prolific goalscorer the planet has ever seen. No player has ever scored as many goals for Real Madrid ( ), and he also leads the way for Portugal. In fact, Ronaldo's haul for his country is . He has found the back of the net a total of 893 times throughout his illustrious career and won three Premier League titles, five Champions League crowns and Euro 2016, to name just a few of his many trophies. Despite entering the final year of his 30s in 2024, the former and star has shown he still has much to give for both club and country, having , striking 52 times for Portugal and Al-Nassr.",

        "description": "While the 737 MAX has recently seen controversy, the larger Boeing 737NG family of passenger jets has proven successful in several civilian and military uses.",
        "content": "The Boeing 737 is one of the most popular airliners in the world, with Boeing delivering over 11,000 units of this single aisle twin since it first opened its order books in 1955. The 737 has had many variants and generations through the years, with the latest MAX generation launched in 2011, and first flying in 2016. However, the third-generation 737, also known as the 737 New Generation (NG), is the most popular generation of this passenger jet, with almost 7,000 units delivered to various customers. The majority of this number is the 737-800, with over 5,000 airliners delivered to various operators. The 737-700 stands at a distant second, with just over 1,100 examples transferred to customers. Aside from its passenger duties, the 737NG also served in other official capacities that most would not expect. So, what made the 737NG a winner for Boeing? And who is the largest operator of this aircraft generation? The 737NG was probably Boeing's reply to the Airbus A320 that was first delivered to Air France in 1988. According to former Airbus COO-Customers John Leahy, in an interview with Leeham News and Analysis , \"We were probably responsible for the [Boeing] 737 NG because a lot of people thought the 737 Classic could outsell the A320.\" Leahy adds, \"At least the guys in Seattle thought that. But when the dyed-in-the-wool, 100% Boeing customer United switched over to the A320, that's when they panicked and decided they needed to update the 737.\" The first NG variant — the 737-800 — made its first flight in 1997, with the first delivery made in 1998 to German leisure airline Hapag-Lloyd Flug. The 737NG received upgraded engines with better fuel efficiency than the Classics, moving over from the CFM56-3 to the CFM56-7 series engine. It also received a new wing design, which allowed the plane to carry more fuel and fly longer distances. The 737-800 could seat 189 passengers and fly 2,970 nautical miles (or 5,520 km) in one hop. While this isn't the longest range or the largest capacity passenger jet, many airlines found that this is the sweet spot for their domestic and regional flights, making the -800 the most popular 737 variant. Nevertheless, Boeing made other variants of the NG to cater to the demands of other customers. The 737-800 was the first development in the NG family, but Boeing also made three other variants. The 737-600 is the smallest version, with a seating capacity of just 130 passengers. However, it has the longest range in the NG family at 3,235 nautical miles (5,991 km). The 737-700 is slightly longer than the -600 variant, but is still smaller than the -800 with just 148 seats and a 3,010 nautical miles (5,574 km) of range. The largest and longest 737NG is the 737-900ER variant capable of seating 215, and can fly up to 2,950 nautical miles (5,463 km). Aside from these four main variants, Boeing also produced several other subvariants, including a cargo version (-700C), an extended range variant (-900ER), and variants with winglets (-700, -800, -900, and -900ER). All in all, Boeing sold nearly 7,000 examples across all of these variants. Southwest is the 737NG's most loyal customer, having taken delivery of over 560 airliners. But Ryanair is a close second, with over 530 examples. You might not be familiar with the third-largest operator of the 737NG, as it's NAS Aviation Services, LLC — an aircraft leasing company. Finally, the fourth and fifth largest operators of the type is United and American — each with 325 and 305 jets, respectively. Aside from airline duties, the 737NG family also served in the military. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps have acquired a couple of Boeing 737-700C and converted them for airlift missions. This variant is called the C-40 Clipper, and is essentially a cargo plane converted for mixed passenger and cargo use. Aside from these, the two other military variants of the 737NG have a little bit more exciting roles. Boeing E-7 Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) is based on the 737-700, but features a large Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar on its back. It can detect identify targets from as far as 300 nautical miles (555 km) out, and has a maximum range of 3,500 nautical miles (6,482 km). It's also capable of in-flight refueling, greatly extending its operational range and loiter time. The P-8 Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft is another 737NG derivative. This version of the 737 has several features , including anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. This is the successor to the legendary P-3 Orion , which the U.S. used for over 50 years. The Boeing 737 family is the smallest jet that Boeing produced, aside from the Boeing 717 (which was essentially a rebadged MD-95). Because of this, it made sense for Boeing to market it to corporations and private individuals as a private jet. So, the 737 NG was the first of the 737 family to be fully marketed as the Boeing Business Jet. The third generation 737s came in three business jet configurations — the first one offered was the BBJ1, which combined the fuselage of the -700 with the wings and landing from the larger -800. Boeing eventually offered the larger BBJ2 and BBJ3 models, which were based on the -800 and -900ER, respectively. Boeing sold 152 copies of these aircraft to private buyers, and while they're not the most expensive private jets on the market , they're still pretty pricey — costing at least $71 million when they were new. So, even if Boeing primarily makes airliners and military aircraft, they're also one of the best private jet manufacturers globally . Although the 737 was a pretty successful design, it was getting old by 2011, as it had made its first flight in 1967. However, when Airbus launched the A320neo, Boeing didn't want to spend the years required to build an all-new model to compete against it. So, instead, it launched the Boeing 737 MAX series. The 737 MAX family looked promising on paper. However, less than three years after its first flight, the 737 MAX 8 has had two lethal crashes related to a faulty safety system . More recently, Boeing again came into scrutiny after the door plug on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 blew off midflight . While Boeing has fixed the MCAS issue, with the FAA clearing the MAX 8 to return to the skies , the newer problems that recently came to light reflect poorly on the company's safety culture. This is a major disappointment, especially as this was the same company that built the highly successful and incredibly safe 737 NG, which only had a hull loss of 0.18 per million flights. This is a low number, especially when compared with the first-generation 737s, which had 1.78 hull losses per one million departures — and the 737 MAX series, which had 1.48 hull losses per one million flights. Nevertheless, some pilots still believe in Boeing , especially as the changes to the company's senior leadership are expected to turn things around.",

Raw general manager Adam Pearce announced Lynch and Morgan will fight for the title inside a steel cage. BREAKING NEWS: #WWERaw General Manager @ScrapDaddyAP has just announced a Women's World Championship STEEL CAGE Match between @YaOnlyLivvOnce & @BeckyLynchWWE TONIGHT on #WWERaw!📺 8/7c @USANetwork 📍 Savannah, GA🎟️https://t.co/ssePNRis6t pic.twitter.com/vPEtwL6uNa Morgan defeated Lynch to win the title at King and Queen of the Ring on Saturday. The finish saw Dominik Mysterio toss a chair into the ring in an attempt to get Lynch to use it in retaliation for Morgan injuring Rhea Ripley and putting her out of action. Instead, Morgan hit Lynch with a DDT on the chair and followed up with oblivion to get the pin for the victory. Lynch did a backstage promo later in the show vowing to invoke her rematch clause and teasing the bout for Monday night. \"On Monday at Raw, I am getting that rematch\"@BeckyLynchWWE is NOT happy with how she lost her Women's World Championship and wants a rematch immediately...#WWEKingAndQueen pic.twitter.com/SKKHsWrCuq Given how the first contest between these two women ended, the cage will be used in an attempt to keep anyone from interfering. Of course, the history of wrestling suggests that may not end up being the case. After Ripley vacated the title on April 15 due to a shoulder injury, Lynch won a 14-woman battle royal on the April 22 episode of Raw to become the champion for the fifth time. The Man won the battle royal by last eliminating Morgan. Even though Lynch's win felt like a surprise in the moment, it has allowed WWE to prolong her feud with Morgan until Ripley is able to return. Monday night could either be the culmination of this feud, or WWE will use it to set up one final grudge match between Lynch and Morgan with the Clash at the Castle premium live event coming up on June 15 at the OVO Hydro arena in Glasgow, Scotland.

        "description": "Says he can't let off-field stuff impact his game",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,” Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers’ series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium _ when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Sutter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. “It’s getting better day by day. It’s definitely _ today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn’t run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. “Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn’t play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He’s not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,” Ohtani said. “So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.” He hasn’t concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn’t pitching. “It’s hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,” he said. “I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.”",

Jon Rydberg and John Devorss will coach the country’s teams for the sport at the Paralympics. The U.S. Tennis Association announced the appointments on Monday. The American athletes for tennis will be named at a later date. For the Olympics, the choices will be based on the WTA and ATP rankings on June 10, the day after the French Open ends. Tennis for the Olympics and Paralympics will be played at Roland Garros, the site of the French Open, which is being played now. The Olympics are July 26 to Aug. 11; the Paralympics are Aug. 28 to Sept. 8. Rinaldi also worked for Team USA at the Tokyo Games three years ago. She was the U.S. Billie Jean King Cup captain for seven years, winning the title in 2017. She was replaced by Lindsay Davenport after the 2023 Cup. This will be Bryan’s first Olympics as a coach. He and his twin brother, Mike, won a gold medal in doubles at the London Games in 2012 and a bronze in Beijing four years earlier. Rydberg is a four-time Paralympian.

        "description": "From the Palme d’Or-winning Anora to The Surfer, starring one-man meme machine Nicolas Cage, to Emilia Pérez with Selena Gomez, 10 of the best movies unveiled at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.",
        "content": "Cannes always has moments like no other festival. The 77th edition of the world’s biggest movie marathon perhaps did not serve up enough memorable moments on screen, but there was still enough variety to excite and entertain. Here, then, is a guide to the 10 best films that were unveiled at this year’s festival. Mikey Madison is terrific as Anora, or “Ani”, a lap dancer who marries one of her clients, the spoiled son of an obscenely wealthy Russian, only to feel the full wrath of his family. Certainly, his latest will do nothing to smooth over relations; a compelling near three-hour drama, it depicts Iman (Missagh Zareh), a father of two whose work as an investigator puts him in conflict with his own family. The jury gave Rasoulof a special award; he deserved more. Some competition films will inevitably go home empty-handed, but Swedish director Magnus von Horn ( ) can count himself extremely unlucky not to take home a prize for this immaculate black-and-white period piece. Set in post-World War I Copenhagen, the shocking drama follows a young factory worker (Vic Carmen Sonne) who falls pregnant and forges a bond with a woman (Trine Dyrholm) who runs a covert adoption agency for mothers dealing with unwanted children. A horror film of sorts, highly inspired by , this was easily the most striking-looking movie in the official selection. Exploring issues of ageing, beauty and the male gaze, Fargeat won best screenplay and the hearts of Cannes audiences, who revelled in the film’s increasingly demented prosthetics and unhinged performances. While Cage has graced Cannes before with crazy films (think or ), this tale of a father who clashes with a posse of aggressive local surfers on an Australian beach required more subtleties from the actor. Engineered with a clever script that plays with perceptions of reality, this one really caught a wave. This aside, Kirill Serebrennikov’s radical account of Limonov’s life, from little-known writer to political player, still came bursting with a deeply felt energy. Rattling with Lou Reed songs, it boasts some bravura filmmaking moments, not least a whirlwind transition across the 1980s as the director spirits us to 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Certainly it cut deeper than fellow competition entry and its portrait of 70s-era Donald Trump. With lively songs by French singer Camille and equally arresting choreography by Damien Jalet, it has all the fizz of a Hollywood show-stopper, but comes armed with a social conscience too. Programmed in Director’s Fortnight, Ryan J. Sloan’s debut had the feel of early Christopher Nolan. His co-writer and wife, Ariella Mastroianni, starred as a young mother with dyschronometria, a condition that means you cannot perceive time. The result was a slow-burn noir, humming with a moody sax score from Steve Matthew Carter, that truly reels the audience into its world. The film will go down as one of those punchy indie gems – an electrician by trade, Sloan made it over two years, self-financing; and while at Cannes, he learned that the power had been cut at his and Mastroianni’s flat. What a story. A three-time Jury prizewinner, Andrea Arnold surprisingly got nothing here, but there was widespread critical admiration for her fable-like coming-of-age film set in Britain’s North Kent region. s Barry Keoghan was the big draw, playing a wayward father who even bashes out a version of Blur’s “The Universal” in one touching singalong scene. But the film spins on the relationship between his rebellious 12-year-old daughter Bailey (Nykiya Adams) and the mysterious Bird (Franz Rogowski), a curious individual who has returned to the area. Films like and are evoked as Arnold switches from social to magic realism with a deft click of her finger. His wife and long-time collaborator, Zhao Tao, is graceful as Qiaoqiao, a woman from Datong in northern China who goes on an extensive quest to find her shady boyfriend, who has left the city to seek his fortune.

        "content": "During this call, the victim urgently requested his bank card, an indication that the suspects' intentions might have included financial extortion. On a Thursday night in Ginsberg, Eastern Cape, an unsettling event transpired involving a recent recipient of the Road Accident Fund (RAF). The victim, while escorting his girlfriend from his homestead to her residence, was suddenly confronted by suspects in a white VW Polo. The suspects discharged two warning shots into the air, causing immediate panic and confusion. In the ensuing chaos, the couple was forcibly shoved into the vehicle by the assailants, who then made a hasty escape towards the local graveyard. As the night progressed, the victim managed to make a distress call to his brother from a location near Man’s Tavern in King William’s Town. During this call, the victim urgently requested his bank card, an indication that the suspects’ intentions might have included financial extortion. The brother, demonstrating quick thinking and composure, immediately alerted the authorities about the dire situation. The police responded swiftly by deploying a rapid response team to track and intercept the suspects. The coordinated efforts and the resultant pressure applied by law enforcement officers caused the suspects to lose their nerve. Faced with the imminent threat of capture, the suspects abandoned their plan, allowing the victims to escape unscathed and without any money being withdrawn from the victim’s account. The swift action taken by the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigation, commonly known as the Hawks, led to the apprehension of four suspects aged between 33 and 45, following the recent kidnapping incident in Ginsberg. These suspects are scheduled to appear in King William’s Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Captain Yolisa Mgolodela, the Eastern Cape Hawks spokesperson, provided an account of the incident, highlighting the prompt response and subsequent arrests. Major General Mboiki Obed Ngwenya, the provincial head of the Hawks, commended the collaborative effort of the team that facilitated the safe release of the victim. He praised the combined forces’ efficiency in ensuring that the suspects were apprehended without any ransom being paid. The rapid response by law enforcement highlighted their capability to thwart the suspects’ plans and secure the safety of the victims.",

Jessica Matthews was making her way home along a country road in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, when the lone bird darted into her Ford Ka and made itself comfortable. The pesky rooster, nicknamed Barry, then decided to tuck in to the driver's shopping as she tried to usher the animal out. Now footage has emerged of the amusing incident which sees the lost cockerel clinging to Ms Matthews' window, inside her car and even perched on her shoulder. To the driver's amazement, the bird first appears sitting in the window of the parked car, seemingly unsure whether to enter.

By now, the cockerel has made itself very comfortable on the passenger seat, showing little interest of returning to the great outdoors. Soon it is pitch black outside and Ms Matthews realises time is running out to sort a place for Barry to stay for the night. The driver makes a last gasp attempt to lure the cockerel, who has laid droppings all over the inside of the vehicle, back into the wild using raspberries and pecan nuts. Holding the animal in her lap, Ms Matthews accepts there is no option but to take the bird home, despite her having five cats as pets, and in the next clips Barry can be seen sitting on her shoulder and eating some food. The shocked driver said: 'He just didn't want to get out of the car. 'I was trying to nudge it out the car and then the next thing I know he's sat on the passenger seat.

        "content": "A TRAIN driver did all he could when he saw two women walking towards him on the track, Sligo Coroner’s Court has heard. Padraig O’Gara blew the horn and applied the emergency brakes after seeing the pair “in the middle of the track”. Mum-of-four Jessica McLoughlin , 40, of Rusheen Ard, Caltragh Co Sligo, sustained fatal injuries after she and her niece, Rebecca Leydon, 26, were involved in a collision with a Sligo to Dublin train near Ballisodare on 14 June 2023. In a statement, Ms Leydon told the coroner that the pair had been walking the track after getting off a train in Collooney after realising she had left her phone in a shop in Sligo. She said they had been walking back to Sligo on the train line and did not realise there was a train due, adding: “I feel guilty about it.” Ms Leydon said they heard the train horn, adding: “When I looked I didn’t think it was going to hit us but it was the steps that hit us. “I broke my leg and got staples in two spots.” Mr O’Gara said in his statement that he was driving the 3.05pm train from Dublin to Sligo at the time of the incident. He recalled seeing the two women in the distance in the middle of the track walking towards him after he passed over the Ballisodare water bridge. He said: “I blew the horn and applied the train brakes to the emergency position,” he said, adding that the two moved to the side of the track. “One lady jumped clear. The other lady didn’t. “She stood on the outside of the rail track while still standing on the track.” He said this woman was “crouched forward”. “I continued to blow the train horn as I knew she wasn’t clear. She collided with the side of the train.” His colleague, ticket inspector Greg Flanagan, told the coroner in a statement that the emergency brakes were applied just after Ballisodare. Initially, Ms McLoughlin had a pulse and paramedics treated the wound but she went into cardiac arrest with a doctor pronouncing her dead at the scene at 4.28pm. An autopsy showed that Ms McLoughlin had sustained multiple injuries in the collision. The coroner’s court heard that toxicology tests showed the presence of alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs in her system. Coroner Eamonn MacGowan recorded a narrative verdict that Ms McLoughlin had died on the railway line from injuries sustained in a collision with a train, against a background of alcohol and drug intoxication.",

        "content": "ASHBURN, Va. ( DC News Now ) — ESPN said Monday that the Washington Commanders’ new kicker faces allegations of sexual assault that supposedly took place during his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. ESPN said two women filed a lawsuit in Duval County Circuit Civil Court, accusing Brandon McManus of assaulting them. The report said the women also claim the Jaguars didn’t “create a safe environment” for staff members who serve the football team. The women asked for $1 million and a jury trial. A spokesman for the Washington Commanders provided DC News Now with the following statement Monday: Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 21:14, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:14, 27 May 2024 e-mail Advertisement Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

        "content": "Universiti Teknologi Brunei’s (UTB) peatland forest fire monitoring alert system was chosen as a first prize winner in the innovation track of the Huawei ICT Competition 2023-2024 Global Finals in Shenzhen China. According to the university, the system integrates remote sensing devices with real-time data collection techniques to measure and monitor parameters such as water level, carbon emissions, soil temperature, soil humidity and weather conditions. “By leveraging IoT, machine learning and cloud technology, the system provides early warnings of potential peat fire outbreaks or ecosystem degradation, enabling immediate action from stakeholders,” said UTB. The university said the system’s dashboard offers precise monitoring and visualisation tools to facilitate comprehensive understanding and informed decision-making regarding peatland conservation and management strategies. “The outstanding achievement by UTB’s Team CIE showcases the university’s commitment to fostering innovation and technological excellence, positioning Brunei Darussalam as a leader in cutting edge research and development,” said UTB. UTB’s Team CIE was supervised by Dr Wida Susanty binti Suhaili and Dr Thein Wan and comprised Master of Science by Research students Md Daniel bin Haji Abdullah, Siti Rasyidah binti Haji Ismail and Md Musyaffa bin Abdul Aziz. The competition saw over 170,000 students from more than 2,000 colleges and universities across 80 countries participate. Meanwhile, UTB students Jaicquailina Vanessa anak Ujai and Abdul Hannan As’ari bin Haji Abdul Khalid As’ari secured third place in the highly competitive 2024 Guangxi-ASEAN Vocational Skills Competition of Water Quality Testing for University and Vocational College Students. The competition was hosted by Guangxi Polytechnic of Construction (GXPC) and is part of the Clean Water Action: China-ASEAN Youth Envoys Programme. The programme aimed at enhancing environmental protection and leadership skills among young people in China and ASEAN countries. UTB lecturer Dr Sharina Yunus said, “Despite their busy schedule with final year projects and final year exams, Jaicquailina and Abdul Hannan put in a commendable effort. Their dedication and hard work are truly admirable.” Universiti Teknologi Brunei’s Team CIE at the ICT competition.

        "content": "ASHBURN, Va. ( ) — that the Washington Commanders’ new kicker faces allegations of sexual assault that supposedly took place during his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. ESPN said two women filed a lawsuit in Duval County Circuit Civil Court, accusing Brandon McManus of assaulting them. The report said the women also claim the Jaguars didn’t “create a safe environment” for staff members who serve the football team. The women asked for $1 million and a jury trial. A spokesman for the Washington Commanders provided DC News Now with the following statement Monday: Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,\" Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers' series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. \"Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers , Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. \"It’s getting better day by day. It's definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn't run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. \"Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn't play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,\" he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He's not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,\" Ohtani said. ”So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.\" He hasn't concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn't pitching. “It's hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,\" he said. ”I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.\" AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB",

        "content": "Chloe Sevigny puts on a VERY leggy display in black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day weekend with family in SoHo By Deirdre Durkan-simonds For Dailymail.com Published: 20:49, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:14, 27 May 2024 e-mail 1 View comments Chloe Sevigny showcased her incredibly toned legs in a pair of tiny black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day Weekend with her family. As she stepped out with her husband, Siniša Mačković, and their son, Vanja, four, in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, the 49-year-old actress appeared in high spirits as she strutted down the sidewalk in a pair of black Birkenstocks. For their laid-back outing, the Golden Globe winner wore a white criss-cross top, a floral crossbody purse, calf-length socks and oversized black shades. As her spouse pushed their tot's stroller, Vanja could be seen sweetly holding onto his mother's hand. Mačković, who works as the director of Karma Art Gallery in New York City , wore a light blue button-down over a white t-shirt and jeans. Chloe Sevigny showcased her incredibly toned legs in a pair of tiny black shorts while enjoying Memorial Day Weekend with her family The couple's little boy wore a bright red graphic t-shirt and matching shorts. Sevigny married her husband Siniša Mačković in May of 2020 in a secret ceremony in New York's City Hall. Less than two months later, they welcomed their son. Two years after their marriage, they celebrated with their loved ones by throwing a bash in Darien, Connecticut, where the Big Love alumna grew up. According to Vogue , the pair was introduced through a mutual friend but did not meet in person until they crossed paths later at a Gagosian opening. They saw each other at social settings various times before they started dating. When they found out they were expecting, Sevigny and Mačković celebrated with a couple's getaway in Turks and Caicos. It was there her now-husband proposed and, shortly thereafter, the couple eloped in New York City. As she stepped out with her husband, Siniša Mačković, and their son, Vanja, four, in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood, the 49-year-old actress appeared in high spirits as she strutted down the sidewalk in a pair of black Birkenstocks Sevigny is best known for her role as Nicolette Grant on the HBO series Big Love, which she starred on from 2006 to 2011 (seen in March 2024) Though Sevigny has chosen to keep many details about her family life private, she did open up to The Cut ahead of her son's arrival, talking about when she learned her child's gender. 'When I found out I was having a boy, I had to wrap my head around that, as I am so girly. I don't even have that many boy friends; all of my friends are girls. I just relate better to girls. I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with a boy?' she shared. Despite her initial hesitation, she shared that she was 'thrilled and so excited about the whole thing.' Sevigny previously admitted that their pregnancy was not planned in an interview with LA Magazine in 2020, saying 'It was a real shocker. This was an accident. I didn't think I'd ever have kids. I just acquiesced that it was not going to happen for me.' Sevigny is best known for her role as Nicolette Grant on the HBO series Big Love, which she starred on from 2006 to 2011. Over her career, she's won a Golden Globe, Satellite Award and Independent Spirit Award. Additionally, she's been nominated for an Oscar and three SAG Awards.

        "content": "If there's one thing NBA fans have learned about Anthony Edwards this postseason, it's that the Minnesota Timberwolves young star never lacks confidence. Even if it's a task that requires the Timberwolves to make history, Edwards remains as confident as ever in himself and his team. That stood true with Edwards' optimistic comments following Sunday's Game 3 loss, leaving the Timberwolves in a 3-0 hole — a deficit no NBA team has ever overcome. As The Athletic's Sam Amick detailed, Edwards' message was simple: \"Time to make history.\" “Time to make history, fellas,” Edwards shouted. “I still don’t feel like they can beat us, bro. We haven’t all been clicking at one time. One game. One game.” While it may feel like Edwards is overly optimistic with these comments, they're far from surprising. His confidence never seems to waver and after witnessing this Timberwolves team win three games in Denver against the Nuggets last series, why should it? But even still, the Dallas Mavericks deserve their flowers for not only stealing two road games from Minnesota, but fighting off a team scrapping to get back in this series in Game 3. Dallas gutted out a 116-107 victory. Through three games, the Mavericks appear to be the far superior team, and for the Timberwolves to have a shot at getting back in this series, they'll need to solve multiple issues immediately.",

        "description": "Bill Walton made his mark on the NBA as a player despite battling injuries throughout his career.",
        "content": "Bill Walton only played 209 NBA games during his prime with the Portland Trail Blazers because of injuries that led to 39 surgeries, mostly on his feet and ankles. But what he showed in those games and in leading Portland to the league championship in 1977 was something that had never been seen in the game's history to that point. It was announced on Monday that Walton died at the age of 71. He was a 6-foot-11 center who dominated with an all-around game. He could do it all: score, rebound, defend and — much rarer in those days for a big man — he was a great passer. In an era that featured the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bob Lanier, Dave Cowens and Wes Unseld in the pivot, Walton more than held his own with all of them. When he and the Trail Blazers won the NBA Championship, their other starters were power forward Maurice Lucas, small forward Bob Gross and guards Lionel Hollins and Dave Twardzik. Lucas and Hollins were solid players while Gross and Twardzik were the ultimate role players. But because of Walton, that team defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, which featured Julius Erving, Doug Collins and George McGinnis, in the NBA Finals. That season, 1976-77, Walton managed to play 65 games. That was the most in his prime and the most he would play in a season until 1984-85, when he, as a mere shadow of the player he had been, saw action in 67 games. But back to that 1976-77 season. Walton averaged 18.6 points, led the league with 14.4 rebounds and 3.2 blocks and also dished out 3.8 assists per game. The following season, in only 58 games, he was the Most Valuable Player with 18.9 PPG, 13.2 rebounds, 2.5 blocks and five assists per game. It was a continuation of what Walton had done during his three seasons at UCLA from 1971-1974. He led the team to an 86-4 record after winning his first 73 games at the school, taking home two NCAA titles, and was the Naismith College Player of the Year all three seasons before Portland took him first overall in the 1974 NBA Draft. Walton's injuries and surgeries caused him to miss 762 games, including three complete seasons, in his 13-season career. He won his second championship with the Boston Celtics in 1986, when Walton was also named the Sixth Man on the Year. Many may only know Walton as an outstanding and sometimes polarizing NBA analyst. But before that, he was a truly great and unique player.",

        "content": "As he addressed the 4th International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in Antigua and Barbuda this afternoon, Prime Minister Philip Davis called for action on climate change and pointed to the recent bushfires in The Bahamas as he highlighted the escalating climate crisis. “The Bahamas is burning,” Davis said. “Bushfires stubbornly burn throughout our islands in the heat of the Bahamian dry season. The flames have scorched our coppice and pine forests, unleashing an ashy haze that has spread across our communities. “Bahamians living near these fires have been forced to breathe smoke-filled air and endure these hazardous conditions. “At one point, the bushfires seriously compromised our visibility, forcing the Lynden Pindling International Airport – the airport of our capital – to temporarily halt all incoming and outgoing air traffic for several hours. Our fear is that this new, fiery reality will become the norm, and April showers will now be replaced by May blazes. “Bushfires are but the latest disaster in an escalating climate crisis.” He noted that the issue is not unique to The Bahamas. “In the past five years, every island in the Caribbean has experienced some degree of water scarcity.” Davis said short-term droughts and long-term droughts continue to impact various Caribbean nations. “The region is more water-insecure than it has ever been, and we, the people of the Caribbean are thirsty for change,” he said. “Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to be clear, I have no intention of becoming a climate martyr. “The deadline for climate reform is long gone. The time has come for climate revolution. Human action caused this crisis, and only humane actions can fix it.” Davis also called on countries to contribute to the Loss and Damage Fund that established at COP 28. “We have secured less than one percent of the estimated $400 billion per year needed to assist the most severely impacted societies,” he said. “Colleagues, it is more important than ever that we work together to operationalise this fund. No SID can do it alone. “We must unite – because unity will be the key in unlocking concessional finance from the very creators of this most dire emergency.” The Loss and Damage Fund would allow for recovery funding for states vulnerable to climate-related disasters.",

        "content": "with The Athletic last week that he was interested in buying out Farhad Moshiri’s stake at Goodison Park. The American businessman due to 777 Partners being locked in an exclusivity agreement. However, in a late-night update [27 May, 9:01pm], the reporter said: “We start with the breaking and exciting news for Everton fans that, after so much woe, there could be better news on the horizon. “John Textor, a part-owner of Crystal Palace, is now believed to be a frontrunner to buy Farhad Moshiri’s majority stake in the club.” After almost a year of twist and turns – usually negative ones – this is finally some fantastic news for Everton supporters. Textor has experience of running a Premier League club in Palace and he clearly has the funds to be able to do likewise at Everton. The American has been very open and honest, admitting at the weekend that if a takeover at Goodison is to happen, it has to be this summer. Given this update via Sky Sports, it seems as though Farhad Moshiri may now be willing to play ball and negotiate with Textor. 777 Partners were never in a position to buy Everton and it is a farce it has taken so long to come to that conclusion. Crystal Palace part-owner John Textor is now believed to be the front-runner to buy Farhad Moshiri’s majority sharehold in Everton, and is trying to sell his stake in Crystal Palace 😮💭 777 Partners proposed acquisition of Everton is unlikely to happen 🖋 If Textor can sell his full 45-per-cent stake in Palace, it then paves the way for this takeover at Everton to go through at long, long last. There are still hurdles to overcome, of course, but at least Toffees fans can rest a little easier now knowing that Textor, and not 777, is the frontrunner to oust Moshiri. In other Everton news,",

        "description": "Russia's big, cheap, retrofitted Soviet-era bombs have become one of its most effective weapons in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Locals who have seen their devastating effects view them as a \"super weapon\".",
        "content": "Launched from the sanctuary of its own airspace, Russia has been using 1.5-tonne \"glide bombs\" to help gain ground and wreak havoc on Ukraine's second-largest city. And there's little Ukraine can do right now to stop them. Russia's big, cheap, retrofitted Soviet-era bombs have become one of its most effective weapons in the full-scale invasion. They contributed to the fall of the strategic city of Avdiivka in February, and are Local police in the region have referred to them as a \"super weapon\", saying they've wiped out entire streets in one fell swoop. Two were used in an attack on a crowded DIY hardware store in Kharkiv City over the weekend, which killed at least 14 people and wounded dozens more, according to Ukrainian authorities. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says they are now the main tool of Russian warfare. come as Kyiv still reels from stalled Western aid. And Mr Zelenskyy has warned the situation is about to get worse. On Sunday he said , urging the West to speed up support. But even with the right weapons, Ukraine faces US restrictions to defend against the cross-border attacks. Analysts say the war has reached an inflection point, and whether Ukraine wins or loses could be decided in the next few months. What are glide bombs? Glide bombs generally start out as old-fashioned \"dumb bombs\", which are fitted with wing kits and satellite navigation guidance systems to give them \"smart\" precision. Russia has been digging into its old Soviet stockpiles to give its heavy, iron FAB-500 and FAB-1500 bombs a new life. Rather than being dropped from overhead, their pop-out wings allow them to glide 50 to 70 kilometres through the air at high speeds to reach a target. And they come with explosives of up to 500 kilograms, which leave craters about 20m wide and 6m deep. Malcolm Davis, a senior defence analyst at the Australian strategic policy institute, says Russia is using these weapons for two main purposes. \"To terrorise the civilian population by hitting civilian targets — hospitals, schools, that sort of thing,\" he told the ABC. \"And secondly, they're using these to support manoeuvres by ground forces.\" While their range is nothing compared to cruise missiles, glide bombs are significantly cheaper. They can reportedly be fitted out for as little as $US20,000 ($30,000). Mr Zelenskyy said more than 3,200 guided bombs were used against Ukrainian targets in April alone, calling them Russia's \"main instrument\" in its attacks. Authorities in Kharkiv told Al Jazeera over the weekend that the bombs were being flown towards the city every 10 to 20 minutes. Why can't Ukraine stop them? Glide bombs aren't particularly sophisticated, nor are they new. Marcus Hellyer, senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), says they are a standard weapon that even Australia has in its supplies. Ukraine has more accurate versions from its Western allies, including the US Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and new long-range GLSDB bombs. But the ground-launched GLSDB glide bombs are reportedly being taken out by Russian electronic jamming. What have been making Russia's glide bombs particularly effective are positioning and policy. The city of Kharkiv lies 40km from the border, so glide bombs can be used without Russian aircraft leaving their airspace. \"The Russians have lots of planes so they can sit outside the Ukrainian air defence network and simply glide bombs in,\" Dr Hellyer said. Not only are they being launched outside the range of most Ukrainian air defence systems, there's another major problem: The US has imposed constraints on Ukraine using its weapons inside Russia. \"Ukraine is sort of fighting with one hand tied behind their back,\" Dr Hellyer said. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned that the US policy restricting weapons use in Russia was \"severely compromising Ukraine's ability to defend itself\". near the border and entered the town of Vovchansk. And Moscow continues to intensify strikes across the region, including on Kharkiv City, which is home to about 1.4 million people. \"It is not possible to defend Ukrainian territory without defeating the glide bomb threat,\" George Barros, the ISW's Russia and Ukraine portfolio lead, reported last week. \"Russian aircraft can strike Kharkiv City indefinitely without ever leaving the sanctuary of Russian airspace.\" Is Ukraine losing? When US Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled to Ukraine earlier this month, he admitted the country was facing a particularly \"challenging time\". A \"bright yellow spark\" and then an explosion — residents of Kharkiv, just kilometres from the Russian border, are bracing for further onslaughts. Scott Lucas, professor of international politics at University College Dublin's Clinton Institute, said: \"It's the most serious position Ukraine has faced since the early months of the Russian invasion in 2022.\" \"But I think it needs to be put into perspective,\" he told ABC's The World. Russia has been attacking in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, after taking the city of Avdiivka earlier in the year. And it has taken about 1,000 square kilometres of territory in Kharkiv over the past two weeks, Professor Lucas said. But he added it was not a \"huge amount\". \"This is a far more limited Russian advance than we saw in that opening phase of the invasion and it could change very, very soon,\" he said. Pivotal months ahead Dr Hellyer says it's hard to imagine a positive outcome for Ukraine unless things fundamentally change. \"At the moment, the Ukrainians are not winning on the battlefield,\" he said. \"They are sort of holding their ground on the battlefield with Western support.\" Major shifts in Ukraine's favour rely on whether the US lifts weapons constraints and how soon new aid will arrive. The Biden administration's $US61 million military aid package finally passed in April after several months of delays. And an additional by the US Department of Defense on Friday. But it did not include more air defence systems, which Mr Zelenskyy was pleading for. Dr Davis says although these packages are helpful, the flow of support to the battlefield remains slow. And they aren't expected to have a real impact until next year. He says it's crucial to get the promised US F-16 fighter jets in the air as soon as possible and to start hitting inside Russia. \"In the meantime, the Russians are doing everything they can to make hay while the sun shines and make progress on the ground,\" he said. \"If Ukraine wins or loses really is going to be decided [in the] next few months.\"",

Two search and rescue helicopters and a plane were sent to the scene alongside the RNLI's all weather lifeboat and one independent lifeboat. A cross-Channel ferry, Commodore Goodwill, also appeared to be assisting with the search. The woman was safely winched to safety out of the water by a Coastguard helicopter at about 4pm on Thursday, HM Coastguard told MailOnline. This is a breaking news story. More to follow.

        "content": "ASHBURN, Va. ( DC News Now ) — ESPN said Monday that the Washington Commanders’ new kicker faces allegations of sexual assault that supposedly took place during his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. ESPN said two women filed a lawsuit in Duval County Circuit Civil Court, accusing Brandon McManus of assaulting them. The report said the women also claim the Jaguars didn’t “create a safe environment” for staff members who serve the football team. The women asked for $1 million and a jury trial. A spokesman for the Washington Commanders provided DC News Now with the following statement Monday: Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Labour Party sacks Edo excos, inaugurates caretaker committee Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Politics Labour Party sacks Edo excos, inaugurates caretaker committee Published on May 27, 2024 By Enahoro Iyemefokhai The crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the Labour Party ahead of the September 21, 2024, governorship election remains unabated as the Julius Abure-led national leadership of the party sacked the state executive led by Kelly Ogbaloi. DAILY POST reports that the national leadership then appointed Elizabeth Ativie, the former Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, as the head of a 17-man caretaker committee. The deputy national chairman of the party, Dr Ayo Olorunfemi, inaugurated the committee on Monday in a hotel in Benin City. Olorunfemi, also named Ken Omusi, the suspended state youth leader of the party, who had earlier in the month purportedly sacked the state executives and appointed himself the acting chairman, a member of the committee. While inaugurating the committee, Olorunfemi said the new leadership of the party in the state came on board due to the expiration of the tenure of the Ogbaloi-led executive council, which ended in April 2024. He said the caretaker committee is expected to take charge of the affairs of the party until a fresh congress is conducted to elect a new executive. He said Mrs Elizabeth Ativie was appointed as chairman of the committee due to her positive and result-oriented track records so far in all her political positions. He called for unity in the party and assured that the party would be more united in Edo State with the Ativie-led committee. In her acceptance remarks, the acting chairman of the party, Mrs Elizabeth Ativie, who commended the national leadership of the party for finding her worthy of the position, promised to move the party to a higher level in the state. Ativie, who also promised to reconcile all aggrieved members of the party, added that a reconciliation team would be set up to resolve all pending issues. When contacted, the embattled Kelly Ogbaloi, the sacked chairman of the party, said his executives are not aware of any changes in leadership in the state. According to him: “We are not aware that the Edo State Labour Party executive has been dissolved because there is a process to all of these. No one man can just wake up one day and remove a structure that has been in existence. “The National Working Committee of the party, led then by Julius Abure, reached an agreement that there would be no congress in Edo State until after the governorship election slated for September 21, 2024. “It was agreed that the exco should be allowed to prosecute the state election, after which Congress can follow.” DAILY POST recalls that last Friday, the Kelly Ogbaloi-led state executive suspended Julius Abure as the national chairman of the party. Meanwhile, a letter signed by Julius Abure said the new executives of the party are expected to work in conjunction with the party’s governorship candidate, Olumide Akapata, towards ensuring victory at the governorship election.

        "content": "It looks like the San Jose Sharks’ head coach search has progressed to second interviews. That’s what Elliotte Friedman reported in his 32 Thoughts Podcast today . Friedman says that San Jose Sharks assistant coach Ryan Warsofsky has had two interviews and ex-Detroit Red Wings head coach Jeff Blashill is about to have his second. Ontario Reign bench boss Marco Sturm has also had one, though Friedman didn’t specify if a second was on the way. Friedman shared a funny Ryan Warsofsky/Brian Rafalski story on his show, which also gave insight into how the insider works. Last week, Friedman also reported that the San Jose Sharks were considering ex-Chicago Blackhawks head coach Jeremy Colliton for the job. San Jose Hockey Now believes that Tampa Bay assistant coach Jeff Halpern is also in the mix. Friedman also noted that Dan Bylsma has emerged as the favorite to land the Seattle Kraken head coach role. He had previously reported that current Kraken assistant coach Jay Leach and ex-San Jose Sharks bench boss Todd McLellan were up for the position. SJHN had previously reported that GM Mike Grier had actually spoken with McLellan about the Sharks job, but there wasn’t a good fit, in terms of McLellan’s goals versus the rebuilding team’s. But could Bylsma’s hire open the door for San Jose to interview Leach? That’s a very real possibility. This article first appeared on San Jose Hockey Now and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Over the past few years, Costa Rica’s real estate market has experienced a significant upturn, driven by a growing number of investors opting to purchase properties for rental purposes. In fact, between 2027 and 2024, the average value per residential real estate went from 153.40 thousands of dollars to 196 thousands. This trend reflects the country’s attractiveness as an investment destination, emphasized by different advantages. Costa Rica Advantages Favorable economic and politic environments Indeed, Costa Rica offers a stable political environment as well as a stable and growing economy, thus providing a reliable framework for business operations and property ownership. Good healthcare system Costa Rica boasts a good healthcare system, renowned for its quality and accessibility, which contributes to an overall high quality of life for residents and investors. Flourishing tourism industry Another key factor of Costa Rica’s demand in the real estate market is its thriving tourism industry. As the country’s leading economic sector, tourism creates demand for vacation rentals all year, especially in touristic locations such as the Pacific coast. Advantageous policies Costa Rica’s government has implemented various incentives for real estate development projects in order to attract foreign investment, including tax breaks for real estate development projects. These incentives not only encourage investment but also create economic growth and jobs, benefiting both investors and local populations. Eco-friendly reputation Furthermore, the eco-friendly reputation of the country also attracts people willing to live closer to nature and to buy sustainable properties. Overall, the combination of all these advantages underscores Costa Rica’s expanding appeal as a destination for real estate, particularly attracting investors, expatriates, and retirees. Indeed, analysts expect the Costa Rican residential real estate market to exhibit a compound annual growth rate of 2.35% from 2024 to 2028. The Downside of Managing Properties Although owning and renting a property has numerous benefits, there are also potential difficulties and drawbacks. In fact, the responsibilities involved in property ownership and management can be time consuming and may even become overwhelming. Managing tenants Finding quality tenants that you can trust your property with can be a long process. To properly manage this step, you must invest your time and energy. In case of short-term rentals, landlords also have to constantly take care of arrivals and departures of guests, ensuring they are welcome properly and making sure the accommodation is in good condition when they leave it. Vacancies Another difficulty that owners are likely to face while renting their property is the absence of tenants. Indeed, it can be difficult to attract tenants, particularly when the owner lacks the time or expertise to effectively promote their property. Property Maintenance The biggest work still resides in the property maintenance. Taking care of a property requires a lot of time and energy, particularly in the absence of hiring external help. Owners must dedicate themselves to tasks such as gardening, cleaning of the space, and even undertaking repairs when necessary. Managing a Property Remotely It gets even more complicated for people who live far from their property, or even abroad, as distance makes it difficult to supervise various tasks effectively and thus creates obstacles to good property management. Narrow oversight Being far away from your property makes property management complicated. In fact, distance prevents the landlords from properly monitoring tenant behavior, property conditions and maintenance issues. Lack of immediate response to emergencies In case of any emergency or security incidents, landlords residing away from their property do not have any immediate power of action, which can lead to uncomfortable or even dangerous situations for tenants and also property damage. Legal issues Landlords have to comply with the local laws and policies concerning rental real estate, even if they live in a different country, which means that they have to keep themselves updated on the potential legal changes. In this regard, managing from a distance is increasing the risk of encountering legal issues. Obstacles to communication Various factors associated with living far away can affect the communication between the landlord and the renters such as time zone differences or language barriers. Having to communicate solely via electronic devices also alter the experience for both landlord and tenants, as it lacks the genuine human connection usually present in face-to-face interaction. Why Hire a Local Property Manager? One solution to go through all of these processes and avoid the difficulties mentioned is to reach out to a local management company. Choosing such a company to help you will indeed take a lot of responsibilities off your shoulders while ensuring a good functioning of your rentals by presenting several advantages. Local network Local management companies have an extensive contact network in the area they are working in, allowing them to ensure a selection of skilled professionals to work on your property, whether it is gardeners, cleaners, or other service providers. Knowledge of the market Local management companies are implanted in the area and have in-depth knowledge of the market, and thus can help you maximize your rentals and incomes. Legal conformity Having a local management company by your side is a perfect way of ensuring that your activity is complying with every legal requirement, sparing you the need to constantly track updates or modifications in laws or policies regarding your activities. Peace of mind Last but not least, entrusting your business to a local management company allows you to relax, as you are assured that all aspects are being taken care of by on-site professionals who can contact you in case of any problems. How to Find a Local Property Management Company Now the crucial step is to find the right local property management company, taking into account your expectations and your property goals. One company that has made a name for itself on the Pacific coast is High Vibe Management , serving regions from Jacó to Uvita, thus including tourist areas such as Playa Hermosa and Playa Esterillos. This versatile enterprise, created by Nicholas Tomeo, revolves around 5 main areas which are Property ownership, Property management, Relocation services, and Vacation home/Concierge services.

This assurance was highlighted at the Bank’s 17th Annual General Meeting held in Blantyre on Friday. During the meeting, shareholders approved a final dividend of K7.039 billion for 2023, a testament to the bank’s robust financial performance. In 2023, FDH Bank reported an impressive post-tax profit of K35.647 billion, a 55 percent increase from the K22.932 billion recorded in 2022. The approval of this final dividend brings the total dividends from 2023 profits to K22.635 billion. The bank had previously paid a first interim dividend of K9.04 billion in August 2023 and a second interim dividend of K6.556 billion in December 2023. FDH Bank’s Chairperson, Charity Mseka, addressed the bank’s outlook for 2024, acknowledging the difficulties posed by persistent foreign currency shortages, a widening trade deficit, and sluggish GDP growth. Despite these challenges, Mseka expressed confidence in the bank’s strategic plan for 2024 to 2026, designed to enhance adaptability, resilience, and sustainable growth. “Our dividend payouts are a clear indicator of our strong performance and our commitment to rewarding our shareholders,” Mseka stated. “We continue to support the public and private sector, engaging with businesses across various industries to address their concerns and assist them in navigating a difficult economic landscape,” she added. Mseka assured shareholders that the bank is focused on meeting customer demands, particularly in addressing forex challenges, and is dedicated to fostering a supportive environment for business growth. Joe Maele of IB Holdings, representing the shareholders, expressed satisfaction with the bank’s performance. “We are pleased with FDH Bank’s results. Despite the economic uncertainties, we believe the bank has the potential to achieve even greater success by exploring new markets and opportunities,” he said. Maele also noted the challenges posed by external factors such as fuel and food shortages, which could impact the bank’s ability to sustain profits. However, he remained optimistic about FDH Bank’s ability to overcome these hurdles and continue delivering value to its shareholders.

        "content": "There are two sugar substitutes that I can beat my chest about their benefits and their zero-calorie status. They are stevia and monk fruit. I will talk about them later. This week, I would like us to familiarize ourselves with the various sugar substitutes that people use. I will give my thoughts about them. There are a few reasons that sugar substitutes may be a healthier choice than regular sugar: Some are low-calorie or calorie-free, which can be helpful for people who want to lose weight. Most have a lower glycaemic index, which helps reduce blood sugar spikes and provides the body with a lower and steadier sugar load. If the substitute is a whole fruit, it can be a source of fibre. They can provide a depth of flavour that you do not get with refined sugar. Let us see some of these substitutes: Allulose It is promoted as a natural sweetener because it is found in nature in jackfruit, figs, raisins, kiwis, dried fruits, maple syrup, and molasses. It is considered a rare sugar because it is found in very small quantities. It is added to many packaged foods. However, to be produced allulose is not isolated from those sources, most commercially available allulose is synthetically made from corn. Certain sugar alcohols Sugar alcohols do not contain ethanol. Currently, eight sugar alcohols are approved for human consumption, they are erythritol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, isomalt, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Of these, xylitol, erythritol, and maltitol are the most widely used in the food industry. Some sugar alcohols can be found in whole foods. Pineapples, olives, asparagus, sweet potatoes, and carrots are natural sources of mannitol; cereals, mushrooms, and some fruits and vegetables contain xylitol; and various fruits like apples, pears, blackberries, peaches, and prunes contain sorbitol. But the sugar alcohols often present in packaged products like sugar-free candies, gums, chocolate, energy bars, cookies, energy drinks, cough syrups, throat lozenges, and toothpaste are synthetically produced. Agave Agave syrup comes from the sap of the agave plant. The plant is first cut and pressed to extract the sugary sap. While this sap is high in sugar, it also contains healthy fibres like fructans, which are linked to beneficial effects on metabolism and insulin. Honey Honey is one of the oldest natural sweeteners and has been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times. Honey, like all carbohydrates, raises blood sugar quickly, but not quite as fast as sugar. As with any sweetener, honey is best consumed in moderation. Syrups Syrups are thick liquid sweeteners often made from plants or fruits. Maple and date syrups are popular varieties. They have about the same amount of calories as sugar and will increase blood sugar by about the same amount. Blackstrap molasses Molasses is thick, dark syrup made by processing sugarcane. Blackstrap molasses is especially thick and contains more nutrients than regular molasses or sugar. It is high in calories and slightly less sweet than sugar. Jaggery Typically used in Asia and Africa, jaggery is a sweetener made from the juices of sugarcane. It is an unrefined form of sugar, so it retains vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. It is used in Ayurvedic medicine to help with cough, digestion issues, and other illnesses. Coconut sugar Coconut sugar is also called coconut palm sugar. A cut is made on the flower of the coconut palm, and the liquid sap is collected into containers. The sap is placed under heat until most of the water has evaporated. The end product is brown and granulated. Its colour is similar to that of raw cane sugar, but the particle size is typically smaller or more variable. Applesauce Apple cooked into a puree makes applesauce. Compared to sugar, applesauce is a low-calorie alternative. It contains fibre, vitamins, and minerals. Applesauce will not increase blood sugar as much as regular sugar does. Bananas and other whole fruits Fruits are nature’s candy. You can use them as a sweetener in foods like plain yogurt, pancakes, and baked goods. They also blend nicely into smoothies and juices. Along with their sweetness and flavour, fruits pack in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. If you use whole fruit, you will also benefit from a healthy fibre load. The fibre content can help curb blood sugar spikes compared to regular sugar. An NIH-funded research team led by Dr. Stanley Hazen at the Cleveland Clinic examined the relationship between erythritol and heart attacks and stroke. According to Dr. Stanley Hazen, “sweeteners like erythritol have rapidly increased in popularity in recent years, but there needs to be more in-depth research into their long-term effects. Cardiovascular disease builds over time and heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. We need to make sure the foods we eat aren’t hidden contributors.” According to Francesco Branca, WHO Director for Nutrition and Food Safety “Replacing free sugars with NSS (non-sugar sweeteners) does not help with weight control in the long term. People need to consider other ways to reduce free sugar intake, such as consuming food with naturally occurring sugars, like fruit, or unsweetened food and beverages. NSS are not essential dietary factors and have no nutritional value. People should reduce the sweetness of the diet altogether, starting early in life, to improve their health” I would like to give my thoughts on these sweeteners. Let me use agave nectar/syrup as an example. It is produced from the sap of a plant that has been used medicinally in Mexico for generations. Although all-natural agave sweeteners may be healthier for you than regular sugar, most of the agave you buy in stores is highly processed. When processed into a syrup, the fructans are extracted and broken down into fructose by exposing the sap to heat and/or enzymes. This process, which is similar to how other unhealthy sweeteners like high fructose corn syrup are made, destroys all of the health-promoting properties of the agave plant. Therefore, it is not atypical that a bottle of agave has more high fructose corn syrup in it than any other commercial sweetener including high fructose corn syrup itself. Because agave syrup is much higher in fructose( not the fructose in whole fruits) than plain sugar, it has a greater potential to cause adverse health effects, such as increased belly fat and fatty liver disease. Let us see another shocking revelation. There is a big difference between the stevia you buy at the grocery store and the stevia you may grow at home. Stevia products found on grocery store shelves, such as Truvia and Stevia in the Raw, do not contain whole stevia leaf. They are made from a highly refined stevia leaf extract called rebaudioside A (Reb-A). Many stevia products have very little stevia in them at all. So, you can now see that processing is a major problem, it can turn a natural and safe sweetener to diseases- causing one. So, let your sugar substitutes be naturally occurring sugars in fruits and veggies and they must be prepared in your home and not store-bought.",

        "content": "For the San Francisco 49ers defense and its crown jewel Nick Bosa, 2024 has so far been a year of change. The 49ers switched up defensive coordinators, firing Steve Wilks and promoting defensive passing game specialist Nick Sorensen while also bringing in former Los Angeles Chargers head coach Brandon Staley as assistant head coach/defense. And the defensive front on which Bosa is the star has been significantly altered. The 49ers' previously longest-tenured player Arik Armstead was released after rejecting a pay cut, while the likes of Javon Kinlaw, Clelin Ferrell, Chase Young and Randy Gregory left in free agency. San Francisco traded for Maliek Collins to replace defensive tackle Armstead, with Jordan Elliott also added to its ranks at that spot. The marquee signing was veteran defensive end Leonard Floyd, who should provide a productive complement to Bosa at the opposite defensive end spot. Yetur Gross-Matos was also signed by the 49ers, with general manager John Lynch suggesting at the NFL's annual meetings that he could be a replacement for Charles Omenihu , whose inside-out versatility was instrumental in 2022 before he departed for the Kansas City Chiefs. Bosa's changeup For Bosa, the raft of new faces has meant a different routine during the 49ers' workout program. Bosa would usually not show up until the workouts are mandatory, but he obliged a request from head coach Kyle Shanahan to report for OTAs. \"Kyle stated why he felt that it would be good for me to be here and asked if I agreed. And I 100 percent did agree,\" said Bosa last week. \"I think it’s just good to get around the new guys — we have a lot of new faces this year. So I want to be around.\" Bosa would usually be in Florida training with elder brother Joey. However, with his sibling at Los Angeles Chargers OTAs ahead of Jim Harbaugh's first season as head coach, the stars aligned to give Bosa a change to get some early fine-tuning done. Nick Bosa, Yetur Gross-Matos and Leonard Floyd in action at OTAS pic.twitter.com/eaSaZKPcaA It is a stark contrast to last year, when Bosa missed all of the offseason workout program and training camp before the 49ers finally signed him to a record-breaking contract extension just a few days before their Week 1 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The league's highest-paid non-quarterback believes the greater level of preparation could be beneficial as he looks to return to his form of 2022, when he posted a league-leading 18.5 sacks, after registering only 10.5 last year. \"It’s a little less workload than I’m doing back home, so it’s good active recovery thing for me,” Bosa added. “And I’m getting football work in specifically, so that’s good. “Last year was kind of tough getting thrown in Week 1 after a walkthrough. \"That’s another reason I’m out here: to get some practice in.\" Firmly divided attention That chance to get an extended period of football work under his belt should put Bosa in a strong position to bounce back, and the combination of changes figures to give him an excellent chance to recapture a title he earned for the first time in 2022, when he was named Defensive Player of the Year. Per FanDuel Sportsbook , Bosa is tied-third with T.J. Watt at +800 in the odds to win Defensive Player of the Year. Only Micah Parsons (+600) and Myles Garrett (+700) have shorter odds. Eight players have won Defensive Player of the Year on multiple occasions, and it's essentially a list of all-time greats. Lawrence Taylor, J.J. Watt and Aaron Donald each won it three times. Joe Greene, Mike Singletary, Bruce Smith, Reggie White and Ray Lewis all won it twice. Donald was the last to achieve the feat, winning for the second time in 2018 and a third in 2020. With extra time to prepare, Bosa should be ready to wreak havoc right off the bat, with the changes in personnel and coaching staff also likely to aid his cause. With Floyd and Collins joining Bosa and Javon Hargrave on the starting defensive front, the 2019 second overall pick figures to regularly see opportunities to take advantage of one-on-ones. Floyd's 39.5 sacks since 2020 are the 10th most in the NFL in that span and, while Collins may not have the same reputation as Armstead, he had a pressure rate of 11.1% last season, per Sports Info Solutions. That was superior to both 49ers starting defensive tackles. Playing with Floyd, Collins and a Pro Bowler in Hargrave who has at least seven sacks in each of the last three seasons, Bosa can head into games knowing teams won't always be able to commit the level of attention to him that they have in previous years. A better coaching fit After a year with a coordinator in Wilks who Shanahan conceded after his firing was \"not the right fit\" for the 49ers, Bosa now gets a coordinator in Sorensen who has spent his entire coaching career in San Francisco's defensive scheme and has vowed to stick to what has brought success to the the D-Line and the defense as a whole in recent years. \"As far as changing things, we’re going to be aggressive, we’re going to do what we do and be an attacking defense,\" Sorensen said in his first press conference. \"We always are looking to evolve in certain ways. I think there’s things throughout the league that you see and it’s like, will this work? Will it not? But as far as what we do, our bread and butter, we’re going to do that.\" That bread and butter will be complemented by potential innovations from Staley, who is going to work closely with a talented and increasingly deep defensive back group. Playing on a much-changed but still stacked front for a coach that knows the system inside-out and who will be supported by a former head coach with the acumen to make an underrated secondary even more difficult to attack, Bosa is in a magnificent spot to return to 2022 form and challenge for a second Defensive Player of the Year crown. Bosa is already well on his way to a place in Canton. The mix of his change in routine and the significant changes made by the 49ers can help him follow in Donald's footsteps and take his place among the best to ever do it on the defensive side of the ball.

        "description": "The Bachelor's Joey Graziadei and Kelsey Anderson have been divulging more and more information about their relationship since the Season 28 finale.",
        "content": "The Bachelor 's Joey Grazadei and his fiancée Kelsey Anderson are perfectly compatible - and it's all because of one popular relationship theory; the olive theory. The tennis pro recently posted a picture on his Instagram Story of his winner and future wife while the pair were out for a meal. Kelsey - who wore a gorgeous yellow dress - was seen making a disgusted face as she sat across from Joey at their outdoor table. Jennifer Lopez shares honest opinion on replacing Katy Perry on American Idol Jennifer Lopez gives strained response when asked about Ben Affleck split rumors Over the snap, Joey wrote: \"Anyone know about the olive theory? Because I LOVE olives. Kelsey does not [laughing face emoji].\" The former reality TV star was referring to the relationship theory some use when deciding whether two people are compatible together. According to USA Today , the \"olive theory\" comes from the sitcom How I Met Your Mother and is first mentioned in its pilot. Main character Ted recounts his and Robin's first date to Lily and Marshall, calling Robin \"the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.\" Robin checks off all of Ted's boxes for the ideal woman, and saves her best attribute \"for last.\" She hates olives while Ted loves them, and the \"olive theory\" is based on Marshall and Lily. Marshall hates olives, while Lily loves them, and \"in a weird way, that's what makes them such a great couple – the perfect balance,\" says Ted. It might seem like the theory is similar to the idea that opposites attract, but it's more complicated than that. Don't miss: Bachelor's Joey is doting boyfriend as he attempts messy manicure on Kelsey [LATEST] Joey Graziadei branded 'best boyfriend ever' for smooth moves with Kelsey [UPDATE] Maria Georgas has tragic explanation for not sharing Mother's Day tribute [INSIGHT] The actual \"olive theory\" is about the give-and-take that comes with being in any relationship. Loving someone means you have to be willing to make sacrifices and compromises for the other person. Some users on social media have used the theory to show compatibility with their partner. Clearly, Joey thinks the olive theory is a perfect example of why he and Kelsey work as a couple. Joey recently celebrated his 29th birthday with a wholesome Instagram message. \"It’s safe to say that this past year has been the craziest of my life. It was met with surprises, difficulties, but most importantly blessings,\" the former Bachelor wrote. The post's second slide revealed a bucket list of 30 things the reality star aims to do before the age of 30. He wrote: \"As I go into this next year of life, I want to look towards capturing more experiences that I’ll be able to call blessings. So I decided to make a bucket list of 30 things that I’d like to do before I turn 30.\" Some of Joey's bucket list items include getting a new tattoo, going to wine tasting in Napa Valley, and even jumping out of a plane. The birthday post came after Kelsey recently posted a video addressing what she called a \"major issue\" in their relationship: Graziadei's love of golf. \"Ladies, I come to you today to discuss a very pressing matter. A matter that I know too well at this point....Golfing. The men are golfing. What is so good about this golfing? Why do these men love this golfing?\" Kelsey, a former marketing manager, suggested women \"take over\" golf to spend time together outdoors.",

        "content": "SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council intends to open a professional gymnastics academy center at Gindun Rajbagh Srinagar, following the pattern of the gymnastics academy center in Jammu, with the objective of promoting gymnastics as a major sport in the Kashmir region. At first, talent scouting and camps will be organised to impart gymnastics coaching in the Kashmir division followed by in-house competitions. Parents and kids are responding reasonably well to the coaching camp that is being organized currently. Over the next few months, more such camps will be conducted in both North and South Kashmir. According to Secretary JKSC Nuzhat Gul, the center will feature world class facilities for the athletes. “The aim is to attract the attention of aspiring athletes from the Kashmir region who want to pursue gymnastics professionally and take advantage of the Sports Policy benefits, which include financial awards, admissions in professional colleges under sports quotas, job prospects under SO12, and much more” she added. In an endeavor of this kind, JKSC, with the assistance of Manish Gupta, a well-known gymnastics coach, has organized a summer coaching camp at SKISC Srinagar. Over the years, notable accomplishments in gymnastics have been made possible by the Jammu and Kashmir Sports Council. Thanks to the Government of J&K for providing state-of-the-art gymnastics facilities established at M A Stadium. Gymnasts’ medal tallies have increased yearly at both the national and international levels. In 2018, the J&K Sports Council launched the Gymnastics Academy in Jammu. Based on J&K gymnasts’ achievements in the Khelo India Games and other national championships, this training center was chosen as a recognized Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy by the Sports Authority of India (the only Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy in India). Later in 2020, this academy was outfitted with world class gymnastics apparatuses and equipment, enabling J&K gymnasts to perform better in both national and international competitions and win various awards for J&K. With the help of these state-of-the-art facilities, J&K gymnasts have represented the country in major international competitions such as the Asian Championships, World Cups, and Commonwealth Games. Muskan Rana and Bavleen Kaur, both Academy trainees, have won gold for J&K and the Best Gymnasts of India titles in the Khelo India Games 2021 and 2022. The Junior National Team Championship was won by Muskan Rana, Manya, Vabhavi Sharma, and Jagriti Thakur. In both national and international competitions, such as the World and Asian Championships, J&K gymnasts have improved, won numerous medals, and displayed outstanding performance. Since 2021, J&K has yielded incredibly successful results in gymnastics. Over the last three years, 13 gymnasts have competed for their country in international competitions and have won almost 80 medals, including 25 Gold, 34 silver, and 21 bronze at national games and other major championships. These successes demonstrate the commitment of the athletes and their coaches supported by JKSC.

        "content": "GENEVA (AP) — Member countries kicked off the World Health Organization's annual assembly on Monday with hopes of improving global readiness for deadly outbreaks like COVID-19, after an ambitious “pandemic treaty” ran aground last week. Health officials are racing to get the world to agree to new ways to prepare for and fight an inevitable future pandemic. COVID-19 is fading into history as elections and crises like climate change and war compete for the public's attention. A bold project to adopt a pandemic “treaty” at this week's World Health Assembly was shelved on Friday as 2 1/2 years of work ran into disagreements over sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics and the technology used to fight them. Experts say the best chance now to address pandemics at the assembly will be proposed changes to the WHO's International Health Regulations, which were set up in 2004. Amendments would urge countries to boost alert, detection and containment capacities and cooperate internationally. One proposal would let the WHO director-general declare a “pandemic emergency.” Envoys say a deal is close, but similar disagreements between rich countries and developing ones that set back the pandemic treaty negotiations linger. Issues remain over proposed “transfer of technology” and the creation of a new fund under WHO in 2030 that would help boost pandemic-fighting capacities “particularly in developing countries.” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus insists the stalled work on the pandemic treaty was not a failure, and acknowledged an “immense” task on a “very ambitious timeline” — alluding to the many years it usually takes for UN member countries to reach global treaties. “Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line,” Tedros said in opening remarks. “But I remain confident that you still will — because where there is a will, there is a way.” “It's now for this World Health Assembly to decide what that way is — meaning the solution is in your hands,” he added. The premise is that pathogens that have no regard for national borders require a united response from all countries. But decision-makers have struggled to balance national interest with the call from WHO officials to think more broadly in the interest of humanity. Health ministers now have to try to overcome deep-set differences, including how the world can share information on emerging pathogens and scarce resources like vaccines when demand skyrockets. “If nothing comes out of WHA (the assembly), it's a huge missed opportunity,” said Yuanqiong Hu, a senior legal and policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, “If they don't come up with a clear road map, how are they going to finish this process?” Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

Siyaasiyiinta saameynta leh ee Iran ayaa billaabay inay abaabulaan kooxaha ololaha doorashada. Kuwani waa magacyada ugu sarreeya ee la filayo inay doorashada Madaxweynaha ka qaybgalaan; Siciid Jalili, oo laba jeer isu soo taagay xilka Madaxweynaha, inkastoo afar sanno ka hor uu u tanaasulay Raisi, ayaa ku dhawaaqay inuu isu soo taagi doono xilka madaxweynaha. Jalili waxa uu inta badan shaqadiisa ku soo qaatay Wasaaradda Arrimaha Dibadda, waxa uuna ahaa madaxii wada xaajoodkii ugu weynaa ee Nukliyeerka Iran intii u dhaxeysay 2007 iyo 2013. Toddobaadkan, madaxweynihii hore ee Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ayaa ka soo muuqday bannaanbax ka dhacay bannaanka gurigiisa, iyadoo taageerrayaashiisa ay dalbanayeen inuu u tartamo xilka Madaxweynaha. Wuxuu ka mid yahay magacyada ka soo muuqan kara doorashada. Alireza Zakani, duqa magaalada Tehran, ayaa sheegay in uusan wax go’aan ah gaarin, laakiin ilo wareedyo ayaa sheegay inuu isku diyaarinayo doorashada. Parviz Fattah, madaxii hore ee Mu’asasada Mostazafan,oo ah shirkad ganacsi oo weyn, ama Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, afhayeenkii hore ee Baarlamaanka Iran inta u dhaxaysa 2020 iyo 2024, ayaa midkood la filayaa inay doorashada ka qaybgalaan iyagoo matalaya kooxaha dhaqanka ee muxaafidka ah. Shaki ayaa weli ku jira in Cali Larijani, oo ah afhayeenka baarlamaanka ee 12 sanno ee u dambeysay , isla markaana khibrad u leh dhexdhexaadinta inuu ka qaybgalayo doorashada. Madaxweynaha ku meel gaarka ah, Muhammad Mokhber, ayaa sidoo kale waxaa soo baxaysa inuu heli karo fursad uu ku tartamo. Waxaa kalo jira magacyo kale oo saameyn ku leh Iran , kuwaaso tartami kara, waxaa ka mid ah; Parviz Fattah, madaxa fulinta ururka EIKO, oo ah urur dhaqaale oo aad u weyn oo hoos yimaada Khamenei. Doorashadan, waxaa sare u qaadaya xiisadda ka jirta bariga dhexe ee ka dhalatay dagaalka Qasa oo saameynta ugu xoogan ay ku leedahay Iran. Galbeedka , Carabta illaa dalalka bariga ee Ruushka iyo Shiinaha ayaa diiradda saaraya inay la socdaan hoggaamiyaha xiga ee Iran iyo sida uu ula jaanqaadi karo xaaladda colaadeed ee dunidda.",

        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — The Parker Lake wildfire near Fort Nelson, B.C., is now classified as \"being held\" as residents start returning home, more than two weeks after the fire forced thousands to evacuate the community. The BC Wildfire Service says rain on Sunday and the efforts of firefighters mean the 123-square-kilometre fire in the northeast corner of the province is not expected to grow. But the blaze hasn't been extinguished and the service says it expects parts of it to continue burning into the fall. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded evacuation orders at 8 a.m., lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home, 17 days after they were ordered to flee. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" — By Ashley Joannou in Vancouver This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

Saundra Glenn, 64, who has osteoarthritis and problems in her hip, knee and ankle, nearly went home after she was struggling to walk to the accessibility box office at the entrance of the festival. Saundra was resting against a fence when Chris' black Mercedes people carrier pulled up next to her and told her she could hop in. She said: 'The back door glided back and Chris Martin was in the backseat. I looked at him and said (to the woman in the passenger seat) \"I can't get in, that's Chris Martin\". 'He goes: \"Yes you can, just come on in\".' Coldplay fan Saundra Glenn (right), 64, was left in utter shock when frontman Chris Martin gave her a lift into BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Luton last week Saundra Glenn, who has osteoarthritis and problems in her hip, knee and ankle, nearly went home after she was struggling to walk to the accessibility box office at the entrance of the festival - until Coldplay's Chris (pictured) came to the rescue Saundra was then escorted into the festival by Chris, who talked with her about 'all kinds of things' including her work in the local community in Luton. She added: 'He said \"It's lovely to hear about what you do\". 'I said \"I'm 65 this summer\", he said \"You don't look it\" and not to worry about age and just to keep doing what I'm doing. 'He seems like a totally decent human being and I told him that... I said \"You're just a very nice person\".' Saundra even took the opportunity to capture the moment with a quick selfie of her and Chris.

        "content": "Actor Johnny Wactor of General Hospital was . The robbers reportedly wanted to steal his catalytic converter as he was defending a female coworker. At around 3:25 a.m., Wactor encountered the three robbers. He witnessed them jacking up his car while escorting the companion, who remains nameless, to her own vehicle. Grant, his brother, told the Daily Mail this information on Saturday. “We’re Southern, born and raised, and we would never let a female walk to their car by herself,” Wactor’s grieving brother said. “He came across them and he thought his truck was being towed. So he said something to the guys, like, ‘Hey, are you towing?’” The brother of Wactor continued, “And then once he turned around, he saw what was happening and he put his coworker behind him. And that’s when they shot him.” Grant used the Los Angeles Police Department's evaluation of the situation to claim that the actor was trying to defend his coworker when the guys opened fire. The robbers left the scene in a different car, and according to the police, they were all wearing masks. As of Monday morning, their Scarlett, his mother, told TMZ that although her son didn't approach the men or attempt to fight them, they shot him and then left the area. Around 3 a.m. PT, the police classified the event as an attempted theft of a catalytic converter. Wactor was taken to the hospital by paramedics and later declared deceased. that night, according to his mother, and he sometimes took on extra bartending duties in between acting jobs. Three coworkers followed him out, two of whom went off on their own before Wactor and the lady he was walking with were questioned. “We are completely devastated,” Wactor’s grandmother, Barbara, told The Daily Mail. “He was just walking to his car. It’s senseless.” Overall, the killing of Johnny Wactor is a tragedy, and he is a victim of senseless violence. His family is understandably devastated. His mother called him “a light in a dark room,” to reporters citing how her son protected his coworker. [ ]",

GOOGLE MAPS Article content As an Indian-American married to a Canadian Jew, I have been horrified at the precipitous, global rise of antisemitism. The gunfire volleyed at a Jewish girls’ school early Saturday morning is a blood-chilling example in a steady stream of antisemitic incidents on Canadian soil. As a mother raising three young children in a sheltered bubble within central Ottawa, I naïvely imagined we would not face the collective impacts on our family so soon. The rise of antisemitism is personally felt, even among those you might not expect. Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content Around Hanukkah, our five-year-old asked, “Why don’t people like Jews?” He’s not able to say why he thinks this, and we go through many scenarios. He made beautiful school drawings of menorahs and Stars of David. Did another kid say something? Or a grown-up? It was not lost on me that he used the general term “people,” and that this first sting of judgment was for his Jewish heritage, rather than the brown skin we share. Article content A while later, he confided in my husband: “Someone on my bus told everyone Jewish to raise their hand. But I knew not to do it, Daddy. They sounded mean.” What would have happened if he’d complied? This should break anyone’s heart. It certainly broke ours. After our trip to India, he cuddled up to me and whispered: “Mommy, I told my class that we saw the synagogue in Mumbai that Bubbe and Zayde visited before I was born. And that I have cousins in Israel. That’s OK, right?” As our eldest, he is grappling with a vague unease. What would you say as a parent? “Yes my son, proudly be who you are.” And unsaid but going through my mind: “We will teach you to be strong against any hate you face.” Because the other answer — “No my love, don’t share that outside our home”— would be confusing and shattering, planting seeds of a shame he should not feel for his cultural inheritance, and for his family. The shadow of antisemitism has crept its way into his consciousness, without his even knowing its name, let alone its shape-shifting manifestations. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content For now, our three- and one-year-old sons have been spared. They belt out or bob along to Shabbat songs, and I can only hope they cling to this unadulterated joy a bit longer. For my part, I have been privy to unfiltered antisemitic remarks in recent months, especially from those unaware of my family background. A professional contact nonchalantly described his employers as “cheap Jews” — sure I’d chuckle along, stunned by my shock, quickly seeking to deflect, “Not to be offensive ...” An acquaintance animatedly documented his dating history and added, “I’d never date a Jew.” A colleague eagerly downplayed the sexual violence against Jewish women on Oct. 7. To speak as freely as they did, these people must have been confident that their views comprised the social norm. I would like to believe that they do not, that most would immediately recoil at the underlying hate, however casually deployed. And I’d like to believe that some people are confused or not informed, or need reminding that antisemitism is an ancient hatred we must actively combat, perhaps even more so when yearning for the self-determination of all peoples. Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content For those of us still committed to originally well-intentioned DEI values , who have fought against other forms of hatred, where are you? Are you scared? We need you. What are the costs of speaking up? What are the costs of not? Have you checked in with your Jewish friends? This is not a zero-sum game. We have the choice to safeguard or sacrifice our society’s commitment to inclusion. We should listen to — not undermine or gaslight — those voices sounding the alarm, with experiences far worse than those detailed here. Consider tuning in for or reviewing the House of Commons Justice Committee’s hearings on antisemitism , now underway. Whatever your politics, please do not be silent — and thereby complicit — when you witness Jew hate in all its modern forms . I regret not speaking up sooner and more forcefully, not telling even some close friends how it’s been — out of shock, disillusionment, fear. I’ll strive to fight against the normalization of antisemitism in our community. If you’ve been feeling the same, I hope you’ll join me.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Govt on Monday extended tenure of Samir V Kamat as secretary of department of defence R&D & DRDO chairman till May 31 next year, amid the move to overhaul the organisation based on recommendations of a high-powered expert committee. Kamat, who was earlier director general of naval systems & materials, one of the seven technology clusters in DRDO, was appointed to the top post in Aug 2022 and was slated to retire this month-end. The extension comes after an 'overseeing committee' was earlier set up to review and ensure time-bound implementation of the recommendations of the nine-member expert committee, headed by former principal scientific advisor to govt, K Vijay Raghavan, which submitted its report in Jan. There has been some opposition to a few reforms suggested by the committee, which has called for a major structural revamp of DRDO. The committee has recommended that DRDO should concentrate only on 'fundamental & applied R&D', leaving systems integration and product management to other agencies and the private sector. DRDO should, as per the committee, restructure its 41 labs into 10 national labs to improve functional synergy and efficiency, an official said. TNN",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Cricket, a popular pastime in the United States in the mid 1800s, makes a big-ticket return to North American shores through the T20 Word Cup but will it be able to leave an impression on the local audience that knows little to nothing about the gentleman’s game? Cricket globally is driven by India but the International Cricket Council sees huge potential in the American market and claims there are already 30 million fans that follow the game in the massive country. The T20 showpiece is also seen as a major stepping stone to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will make a comeback after 128 years when the big event kicks off on June 1. A total of 16 games will be played across three venues New York, Dallas and Lauderhill with a majority of 55 matches scheduled in the Caribbean including the knock-outs. Day three of the competition will have South Africa and Sri Lanka battling it out in New York, where the first ever international cricket game was held between USA and Canada back in 1844. It was a phase when the sport was played widely across America before a much faster alternative in Baseball gained prominence during the Civil War in the 1860s. “... it’s entertainment and that’s what people look for. That’s what Americans look for, you know, they want entertainment,” says legendary West Indian Brian Lara, one of the most recognisable cricketers in the world but someone who admits that he could walk around Miami without getting a second look. “You know, you speak to an American and I’ve done that many times and they’d say ‘you play a game for five days and then you end up in a draw? What’s that all about?’ So it’s, it is difficult,” he explains the challenge of selling Test cricket to an American, who might just warm up to the shortest format though. A couple of weeks of international cricket in an alien land will not be enough to evoke long-lasting interest from the local audience and to ensure the game grows beyond the South Asian and Caribbean expat community, the stakeholders will need more time. For a beginner, cricket can be rather complex to understand especially when one is introduced to “third man”, “fine leg” or “deep mid-wicket”, some of the terms used for the many field placements in the game. The ICC is pulling out all stops to engage with the American audience, whether it is getting eight-time Olympic gold-winning sprinter Usain Bolt on board as the World Cup ambassador or promoting the event at the recent Formula 1 race in Miami. To distract the average American household from the world of baseball, NFL and NBA, cricket will need to grow at the grassroots level. “I surely think the game can grow in the USA. When you have presence in a country people start gravitating towards it and want to know more about,” Bolt, who belongs to the cricket-loving Caribbean, told PTI in a recent interview. The Americans have surely one reason to follow the event. Their team, mainly made up of players from South Asian and Caribbean heritage, will be making its World Cup debut. Venu Pisike, head of USA Cricket, reckons the ICC event will bring much-needed awareness around the game but eventually, it is the lure of taking part in the 2028 Olympics that will draw masses to the sport. “So far, cricket is predominantly an expats’ game, but with the marketing and promotion activities during the World Cup, there is some momentum and the World Cup will definitely boost the opportunities to expand the game in the USA,” said Pisike. “Definitely, the World Cup is bringing a lot of awareness and then the opportunity for cricket to be in the Olympics, that will definitely attract the community because the US is a huge sports country. “Olympics is the prime area where all the sports bodies are focusing on since cricket is going to Olympics, that will actually give more opportunities to expand the sport between the World Cup and the Olympics,” added Pisike. The USA squad picked for the tournament makes up for a bunch of semi-professionals who rely on full-time jobs to run their families. That will have to change if the sport is to appeal to a broader audience in America, believes India-born USA squad member Nisarg Patel. “Ultimately what needs to change in the USA is that an American kid in a high school needs to see a future in the game. There are so many sports in America, the country is built on Olympic medals. “For cricket to succeed, we need to show them there is a career out of playing cricket,” said the spinner, who works full-time with a medical research company in Los Angeles. The start of Major League Cricket last year, the sport’s first professional league in the country, was a big step in that direction. However, to capture the imagination of people in a country with an already crowded and developed sporting landscape, would be a gargantuan challenge for the ICC and other stakeholders.

        "description": "Queensland's Office of the Independent Assessor has referred the mayor's stated army history to the Crime and Corruption Commission after the details were challenged by a newspaper on Anzac Day. He has since provided his service number.",
        "content": "The Queensland body that investigates complaints against councillors has referred the army history of Troy Thompson, the newly elected Townsville mayor, to the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC). Townsville City Councillor Troy Thompson was elected with 46 per cent of the mayoral vote in March, who had spent 12 years in the position. During his months-long campaign, Cr Thompson said he spent about five years with the Royal Australian Corps of Signals and the Special Air Service (SAS) Regiment. Those details were challenged by News Corp publication Townsville Bulletin on Anzac Day when the mayor told the masthead he could not remember his service number. While Cr Thompson sought his service records from the Department of Defence, the state Department of Local Government asked the Office of the Independent Assessor (OIA), a body that investigates councillor conduct, to investigate the mayor and his Australian Defence Force history. 'You've got my service number' Late last week the mayor took to social media to share his service number but did not clarify details of his service and at the time declined to answer questions from the ABC. \"I didn't spend enough time in the reserves to get a medal. It is that simple,\" Cr Thompson said in his video post. \"Respectfully, you've got my service number. That ends the conversation. No more bad media. Let's move forward.\" Cr Thompson also provided his service number to the OIA. \"The information provided by Mayor Thompson was thoroughly considered by the OIA as part of its assessment,\" an OIA spokesperson said. \"The OIA referred the matter to the Crime and Corruption Commission [and] will not be commenting further on this matter.\" 'I'm not concerned' Cr Thompson told the ABC on Monday he had expected that the OIA would refer his army history to the CCC for investigation. \"I'm not concerned. The assessor made it very clear that there was nothing that they could see that would be alarming to them,\" he said. \"It was more of a case of some of these items were brought up pre-election and that is not something that is under their scope, so they now have to push it on to the next area until conclusion.\" Cr Thompson was asked to clarify his army history, but declined and said he had given a three-hour exclusive interview to a commercial program. \"I'm withholding the information ... which is well within my right,\" he said. \"There will be some announcements made later this week, and we have done some recordings. \"It will cover any of the issues that have been brought up. It will be very clear.\" During the local government election, Cr Thompson said he enlisted in the army as a signalman in 1989 and \"was with\" 109 Signal Squadron Karrakatta, Perth, 105 Signal Squadron Fremantle and 152 Signal Squadron Swanbourne. That was detailed in a since-deleted social media post in January he entitled, My Life In The Army. In a podcast discussion with the North Queensland Freedom Network as a mayor candidate during February, he reiterated that he had spent time with those signal squadrons and added he had been with the SAS. \"I spent five years in the military in Perth, so I was in signals in Karrakatta, Fremantle, and SAS Swanbourne,\" he said. After the election and during ABC North Queensland's live coverage of Townsville's Anzac Day parade, Cr Thompson repeated those details when he was asked during a live-to-air interview with Breakfast presenter Michael Clarke about his involvement in the ADF. There have been no findings against Cr Thompson by the OIA or the CCC. Find more local news",

        "description": "Dozens of travelers have gone missing in the Parvati Valley since the 1990s",
        "content": "In 2016, Justin Alexander Shetler embarked on an adventure in India’s Parvati Valley, nicknamed the “Valley of Death.” Mr Shetler, a travel blogger and survivalist from Oregon , notified his followers about the ambitious expedition in early September of that year. “I should return mid September or so,” he wrote on his blog. “If I’m not back by then, don’t look for me.” This was the last thing he ever posted. Now almost a decade after he vanished , his family remains without answers over what happened to him . The traveler’s story is receiving renewed attention thanks to a new ten-part podcast, “Status: Untraced,” which tells the story of Mr Shetler’s life and his family’s attempts to find him. Mr Shetler, who would now be 43, had survival training and would likely have been able to navigate the Parvati Valley wilderness — making his disappearance all the more perplexing, said podcast host Liam Luxon. “Justin is a survival expert, so if somebody was living off the grid, it would be him. He has all the training for it,” Mr Luxon told Fox News . The Parvati Valley is nicknamed “The Valley of Death” for a reason. Dozens of travelers had gone missing there since the 1990s, wrote journalist Harley Rustad in his 2022 book Lost in the Valley of Death: Obsession and Danger in the Himalayas . Mr Luxon, however, isn’t convinced Mr Shetler disappeared because he couldn’t survive in the region. “Other people had passed him on the trail,” he said. “They said he was heading down and there was only one path going up and down. “I’ve made the trek now, and it certainly seemed like he would’ve made it back to the camp. And again, this guy is a survival expert. It wasn’t like he was deep in the desert with no water and nothing around him for days. “He should have made this trek. Nothing added up.” Before he disappeared, Mr Shetler had “given up everything,” Mr Luxon told Fox News. “He didn’t have a job anymore,” the podcast host said. “He was trying to raise money for a school in Nepal that was helping to build after an earthquake. He was traveling around at his own expense.” Mr Shetler’s mother described her son similarly in a Facebook post . “He was a tender-hearted guy from the very beginning and always cared deeply about others, especially homeless, abused and victimized children,” she wrote on his birthday, a year after he went missing in 2017. “He sought to make the world a better place, and I want to honor his efforts.” His mother listed charities that she hoped people would donate to in her son’s honor, including the Nepal Youth Foundation and the San Francisco Child Abuse Prevention Center. Various theories have been suggested as to what happened to the adventurer including claims he was murdered, targeted by the local mafia, or was secretly living off the grid. However Mr Luxon said that he hopes his podcast leads to new evidence. “I think one of the weirdest things about this entire thing has been grieving for somebody I’ve never met,” Mr Luxon told Fox News. “But I do feel like I know him now. I spent hundreds of hours talking to loved ones...Justin also changed my life.”",

        "content": "Fans accuse THAT security guard at Cannes Film Festival of chasing '15 minutes of fame' after clashing with Kelly Rowland, Yoona and Massiel Taveras By Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Codie Bullen For Mailonline Published: 13:41 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:12 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 190 shares 73 View comments Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France , has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women.' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over how the minder was seemingly only 'aggressive with women of color.' Another wrote: 'This lady is a STRAIGHT up HATER... first Kelly Rowland and NOW Massiel Taveras........ she needs to be TERMINATED.' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote. 'It's seems such a coincidence that it is always the same security guard that is giving the same issue. The job does not require them to become the news unless they are doing on purpose... #15Secondsoffame.' Social media users are fuming over the way a female security guard, working the Cannes Film Festival in France, has treated a number of celebrities on the red carpet (seen last week in a heated discussion with singer Kelly Ro)wland 'Like seriously why is @Festival_Cannes allowing their crazy security guards to tackle & harass guests like this?' a fourth asked. 'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet.' A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event.' 'This Cannes film festival security guard needs a pay raise asap,' one X user suggested. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos. The K-pop star-turned-actress, 33, was preparing to pose for pictures on the iconic red stairs when she was stopped by the security guard. The incident came just days after the same guard was scolded by Rowland on the red carpet, which the Destiny's Child implied was due to racism while the staffer's colleagues insisted she was 'only doing her job.' Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs. Following the staffer's viral run-in with Kelly Rowland on Tuesday, and, now, Massiel Taveras and K-pop star Yoona, fans of the stars are calling for the guard to be fired from her position as they accuse her of chasing fame and 'disrespecting women' 'She turned herself into the world's most hated security guard,' one X user wrote while others expressed their rage over seemingly being 'aggressive with women of color' 'Putting yourself in someone's personal space is not doing your job,' a third wrote.

'People should just boycott this spectacle until they learn respect. This same security guard has been harassing guests for years!' Others stated, whether or not she was aware, the guard was putting a 'target on her forehead by rushing everyone on the red carpet' Another shared a meme of a priest getting tackled, which they compared to the security guard blocking celebrities from posing Some pointed out that the guard only seemed to be acting 'aggressive with women of color' 'Needs to be fire,' another tweeted A small handful of X users, however, expressed sympathy for the woman, who they said was just 'enforcing the rules of the event' Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before. The Dominican actress was on the red carpet on Saturday afternoon preparing to unfurl a huge gown with a depiction of Jesus on it, but appeared surprised to be stopped by the security guard. Footage of the spat showed Taveras defy instructions and throw the train of her dress down the stairs, before the situation escalated to the actress shoving the female security guard as she walked into the event. In the video of Taveras' confrontation, the actress seemed to plan to unravel her huge train down the steps, but was quickly stopped by the female security guard sticking out her arm. As other staffers helped lay out the dress while Taveras waved to fans, she grew angry as the security guard kept her arm out in front of her posing. The two exchanged a few words on the red carpet as staff pulled the train up the stairs, before Taveras took the end of the dress from another guard and threw it to the floor in frustration. The female security guard kept her arm close to Taveras as she escorted her up the stairs, although it is unclear what the reason was for the guard to tail her so closely. The growing backlash online comes after the same Cannes security guard, that clashed with Rowland, purposefully blocked Yoona's red carpet photos Taveras also clashed with the female security guard who confronted Kelly days before Elsewhere, a Ukranian model was kicked out by the same guard, but was seen fighting with the worker to get back on the stairs When she reached the top of the stairs, Taveras - who was previously crowned Miss Dominican Republic and competed at Miss Universe - struggled to unfurl the train of her dress. This led her to berate the security guard when she tried to step in, throwing her arms up in frustration. After the dress finally disentangled, Taveras waved to her fans - but the female security guard kept her arm across the actress, and appeared to jostle her towards the entrance. That move sparked an angry reaction from Taveras as she shoved the security guard away from her, before sticking up her finger and scowling at her. It is unclear why Taveras was confronted by the security guard, three days after the staffer also raised eyebrows with her spat with Rowland. The singer expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted. She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' However, colleagues of the security guard at the center of the Cannes spotlight insisted to DailyMail.com that she was acting appropriately and was 'only doing her job.' 'She was an usher working under a lot of pressure to keep people on the carpet moving, so as to stop crowds building up,' said a Festival staff veteran, who has been working in the resort every May for 20 years. 'There was no pushing or shoving, or scolding,' he said. 'Security and safety are the priorities, along with keeping to strict timetables set according to contracts – even the celebrities have to stick to the rules. 'Lots of ushers are involved, and they always act professionally and with politeness. 'In this case, the usher was certainly only doing her job – she didn't do anything wrong.' Rowland expressed shock at her treatment on the red carpet, and pointed to racism as being the reason she was targeted She suggested that 'there were other women who attended that carpet, who did not quite look like me, and they didn't get scolded or pushed off or told to get off.' The usher has not been publicly identified, but she is known to be a local Frenchwoman on a short term contract with the week-long Festival. The source added: 'Suggestions of racism are just ridiculous – visitors, and indeed staff at Cannes come from all kinds of backgrounds, and none are discriminated against.' After footage of Rowland berating the staffer went viral, a lip-reading expert revealed what Kelly really said during the heated interaction with the French woman. Jacqui Press told MailOnline that after the security guard appeared to step on her dress, she apologized and Kelly said: 'It's OK.' However, the security guard then said something else, causing Kelly's change in mood, as she responded: 'Don't talk to me like that.' As the security guard continued to usher her up the stairs, Kelly turned around and repeated the phrase several times.

        "content": "SAN DIEGO ( KSWB/KUSI ) — A Carnival cruise ship responded to calls for help and detoured from its normal vacation route on Saturday to help two dozen people stranded at sea off the coast of Mexico. Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

In the pay and allowances already received, how is that insufficient for their presence in carrying out their professional duties? These people who, at some point in time, claim to be the voice, stand up, and work for the people seem to lose allegiance towards nation-building. The parliamentary pay rise is not a pack of salt. You can make claims off the cuff when members themselves are speaking of financial and economic difficulties in carrying out nation-wide development due to the recession, past Government financial mismanagement, etc. So please try and raise the living standards of the people you all represent before selfishly quenching your own thirst. These politicians who claim to put Fiji and its people first from day one of advertising themselves until they are elected—may we ask how and when?

        "content": "Emma Cotton (or Cotterell) sailed into Sydney harbour on the Rubicon in 1833 as a free immigrant. A 32-year-old woman of independent means, she took on needlework in the colony. Emma’s genteel life unravelled four years later when she appeared before a Sydney court charged with stealing a bundle of “wearing apparel”. Emma was transported to Van Diemen’s Land ( lutruwita or Tasmania) for seven years, then spent the rest of her life in Hobart. After her sudden death in February 1863, a local newspaper reported she was “better known as old Emma the fortune teller”. If Emma had been able to foretell her own future, she may have chosen to stay in London. Conditions for convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were tough. Food was rationed. Many prisoners spent time in penal stations such as Port Arthur, female houses of correction known as “female factories” , probation stations, where convicts were required to serve the initial period of their sentences, or asylums. A prison for boys, Point Puer, was built next to Port Arthur. Some men laboured on road gangs. Women often worked in colonists’ homes as domestic servants. Emma was assigned to work at the Police Magistrate’s office. She also did time, probably at the infamous wash tubs at the Cascades Female Factory in South Hobart. Details of Emma’s case were carefully captured in a convict indent register. Now known as CON16, five of these rectangular registers with their spidery handwriting and tatty bindings survive. Among the many named in them are 627 men, women and children who arrived free or were born free in the Australian colonies but became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land. Their stories have, until now, mostly been forgotten. They challenge popular narratives of Australian history suggesting only convicts from Britain and Ireland were transported to Van Diemen’s Land. The youngest prisoner, a boy called Joseph Levy, was just ten when transported for perjury. The oldest was a 75-year-old man who laboured on a road gang. As well as Indigenous convicts from the Cape colony (now part of South Africa) and New Zealand, more than 60 Aboriginal men from mainland Australia were transported as convicts during the 19th-century frontier wars. In the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (now Victoria), some Aboriginal warriors engaged in economic sabotage. Yanem Goona, also known as “Old Man Billy Billy”, was thought to be a ringleader. When a large flock of sheep was driven off a station near Mt Arapiles in 1845, a white-led Native Police contingent tracked the missing animals, locating around 200 sheep in a “bush yard” built by local Aboriginal people. Yanem Goona was arrested, tried and sentenced to ten years’ transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. When serving his initial probationary period at Norfolk Island , a visitor noted how the old man cried whenever he thought of home. After being shipped to Van Diemen’s Land, Yanem Goona died in custody at the Impression Bay probation station on October 31 1848. Of these 627 people named and detailed in the register, 276 were sentenced in NSW. Forty-five went through the South Australian law courts, 29 were shipped from Victoria, and 19 from Western Australia. Within Van Diemen’s Land itself, 247 free people were sentenced to transportation and sent to Port Arthur and other convict establishments. The overwhelming majority, more than 88%, were male. The first entry in the register is for Thomas Carroll, an Englishman who arrived free in Launceston in November 1831. Carroll opened a livery stables, advertising horses and gigs for hire, and his services breaking in fillies and colts. After moving to Hobart and working as a groom, Carroll was found guilty of stealing a saddle and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He was sent to work on a road gang a few miles from Hobart. Peter Haley (or Caley) was a groom in Adelaide before being sentenced to transportation for ten years for horse stealing. Born near Cape Town, Haley was a Khoisan man who arrived free in Sydney in 1839. By 1850 he had become a notorious horse thief. The following year he was transported to Van Diemen’s Land where he served 15 months at Cascades probation station before being sent into service at New Norfolk, a rural area located inland from Hobart. As a convict labourer, he continued to steal horses. His sentence was extended to transportation for life. Ultimately, Haley absconded, joined a gang of bush-rangers, and was nicknamed “Black Peter”. Eventually the gang was captured, tried and executed. Haley was hanged in Hobart in February 1859 alongside one of his friends. Not all formerly free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were sentenced to transportation. Occasionally their sentence was “death recorded”, meaning they were sentenced to death with an immediate reprieve, then transported instead. Such was the case for Dola, a southeast Asian sailor found guilty in Adelaide of attempted murder on the high seas. When he and seven other convicts were sent to Hobart in June 1851 on the brig Union, the Adelaide Observer announced their departure under the headline “A Good Riddance”. The median age of these convicts was 42.5 years – much higher than today’s median age of 31 years for offenders . Only 10% were under the age of 20. However, there were some outliers. Joseph Levy appeared before the Berrima Circuit Court in NSW in September 1841, aged ten. One of six children from a Catholic family living at Blacktown, Joseph was a key witness in a case involving an alleged horse-stabbing. Levy told the court the horse’s owner had promised him a cow and a calf if the boy said he had witnessed the attack. However, he hadn’t seen anything. Levy was charged with perjury then transported to Van Diemen’s Land for seven years. While incarcerated at Point Puer, a facility for boys, Levy was punished many times. He received a total of 83 “stripes on the breech” and spent 61 days in solitary confinement. When his sentence expired in 1848, Levy was sent back to NSW. Michael Caffray, meanwhile, was a carpenter from Dublin who came out to Van Diemen’s Land as a free migrant. He was 75 when tried in Hobart in 1836 for receiving 40 pounds of stolen mutton and sentenced to transportation for 14 years. Caffray laboured on the Grass Tree Hill road gang on the outskirts of Hobart while under sentence. He died in 1854 from paralysis at Impression Bay on the Tasman Peninsula. Violent interpersonal crimes (murder, manslaughter, rape and assault) account for only 8% of cases resulting in transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. Some crimes, such as larceny, burglary, housebreaking, robbery and stealing from a person (49.5% of cases), are not unexpected. Stealing animals (cattle, horses and sheep) also figure frequently (12.3% of cases). However, offences we view as white collar crimes, which don’t attract lengthy prison sentences today, figure quite often. These include forgery, embezzlement, and fraud and false pretences. Various bigamists, arsonists, military absconders and offenders, perjurers and those convicted of “unnatural offences” also lost their freedom. Convicts who offended while serving their sentences received further punishments. All the free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land had something in common. The activities they engaged in were criminalised, and they were seen as bad characters. Those who survived the system were viewed as “tainted” within their own lifetimes. But the criminal deportation of these formerly free people tells us more about colonial Australian attitudes and values than it does about the individuals themselves.",

        "description": "The latest monthly crime statistics released by SA Police show 22 murders were reported across the state in the past year – a 69 per cent increase from the 13 murders reported in the year prior.",
        "content": "Domestic violence has contributed to an almost 70 per cent spike in the number of reported murders in South Australia over the past year, police say. The latest monthly crime statistics released by SA Police show 22 murders were reported across the state between April 2023 and March 2024 – a 69 per cent increase from the 13 murders reported the year prior. SA Police said arrests had been made for each of the 22 reported murders over the past year and said most were associated with domestic violence-related incidents, mental health, robbery or drugs. \"While not minimising the impact each of these incidents has on the victim's families, such an increase can be regarded as a statistical outlier,\" SA Police said in a statement. The overall number of family and domestic abuse-related offences against the person reports increased by 14 per cent over the past reporting year, with 1,111 reports made in March this year alone. Family and domestic violence support services: The release of the data comes after the SA government in March announced it had to head the state's Royal Commission into Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence. The $3 million inquiry, to begin in July, was prompted by the from alleged family and domestic violence late last year. Mary Leaker, from SA's peak body for family and sexual violence services Embolden, said 31 women across Australia had been killed, allegedly at the hands of a man known to them, so far this year. She said the royal commission would explore the safety barriers confronting women and children at risk of or experiencing violence. \"Through the royal commission, it's really important that we turn the spotlight on people who are using violence, who we know are predominantly men,\" she said. \"A key part of this is looking at how we can better prevent and disrupt violence by high-risk perpetrators.\" Spike in shoplifting reports 'expected to continue' SA Police said shoplifting reports had also increased by 29 per cent over the past year. Between April 2023 and March 2024, 18,794 shop thefts were reported – up from 14,602 the year prior. Almost 58 per cent of reported shop theft offences committed in Adelaide's CBD occurred in Rundle Mall. \"In SA, police have been working proactively with the retail sector and individual businesses in the city that have been frequently targeted to reduce the harm caused by recidivist offenders,\" SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said. \"This significant factor has contributed to businesses increasing their reporting, which has in turn assisted police in combating the problem. \"This increased reporting trend is expected to continue and will further elevate the statistics.\" In March 2022, SA Police launched Operation Measure to combat retail shop theft in the city. The operation has so far resulted in 1,383 apprehensions and more than 8,000 charges being laid. Extra uniformed officers supported by the specialist Security Response Section, mounted police and the dog operations unit began in March this year, following a string of violent incidents. The crackdown resulted in the arrest of in just one day. Fraud, deception reports drop SA experienced an overall increase in crime reporting over the past year, but not all offences are on the rise. Reports of fraud, deception and related offences dropped by 36 per cent, while reports of robbery and related offences dropped by 11 per cent. However, SA Police said aggravated robbery offences increased by 17 per cent, with an additional 74 offences recorded over the past year.",

        "description": "The Opposition’s leader last night warned that The Bahamas’ reputation as an international financial and business centre is in danger if the latest FTX claims are not investigated as “a matter of urgency”.",
        "content": "By NEIL HARTNELL Tribune Business Editor nhartnell@tribunemedia.net The Opposition’s leader last night warned that The Bahamas’ reputation as an international financial and business centre is in danger if the latest FTX claims are not investigated as “a matter of urgency”. Michael Pintard, demanding that the Prime Minister launch a “thorough” probe into accusations that the collapsed crypto exchange and its jailed founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, paid a total $675,000 to “entities affiliated with high-ranking Bahamian government officials and their families”, argued that failing to respond could see this nation “squander” multiple economic diversification opportunities. The emergence of these allegations, in a report by Robert Cleary, appointed by the US Department of Justice trustee to examine FTX’s collapse, is especially timed from The Bahamas’ perspective as it coincides with this jurisdiction’s renewed digital assets push through the recent tabling of the revised Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges Bill in the House of Assembly. Mr Pintard told this newspaper that, if not addressed properly by the Government, the claims in Mr Cleary’s report could undermine not only The Bahamas’ digital assets ambitions but traditional financial services and other forms of business if this nation becomes perceived as an irresponsible jurisdiction. Noting that the Opposition’s stance on FTX had been relatively reserved in the immediate aftermath of the crypto exchange’s collapse, so as “to make sure we were not unwittingly contributing to reputational damage for The Bahamas” and to prevent the Government portraying it as such, Mr Pintard said the Davis administration’s initial silence created “a vacuum” that was filled by speculation. Keishla Adderley, the Prime Minister’s acting press secretary, on Friday declined to comment on Mr Cleary’s report on the basis that it contained no specifics, and no identities or names of the “families”, “officials” and “entities” involved were mentioned. However, Mr Pintard argued that it was “in our collective best interest” that the Government not leave another void when it comes to FTX. Renewing earlier calls for a bi-partisan parliamentary select committee to be appointed to investigate FTXs collapse, featuring members from both political parties, he argued that the Davis administration has an obligation to reply. “The Government is duty-bound at the highest level to speak on the record directly to this matter,” Mr Pintard told Tribune Business. “They have absolutely no choice. Failure to do so put this administration and officials in a very bad light, particularly as they dodged questions earlier. “This moment of truth arises once again for them to set the record straight and we hope they do just that to protect us from further reputational damage.... It’s in our collective best interest that the Prime Minister launches an investigation and speaks candidly on the record on these matters.” Voicing concern about the potential economic fall-out, Mr Pintard added: “It’s very important that we do not squander an opportunity to diversify the financial services sector and put ourselves in a position where we are seen globally as a responsible jurisdiction that has the capacity to not only attract but manage a whole range of businesses including the digital asset space. “This is in our interest as a mature financial destination. If persons do not have confidence in us, it will not only impact our potential in the digital asset space but the entire reputation we have in the traditional financial services space. We must move with a sense of urgency to address these new revelations and the accusations that go with them. We don’t want to squander this opportunity.” Mr Cleary’s report, filed with the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, in a section entitled “payments to and contacts with Bahamian government officials”, drew on evidence assembled by Nardello & Co, a global investigations firm that specialises in bribery and corruption-related matters, plus Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm working for FTX’s US chief, John Ray, to reach its conclusions. “Sullivan & Cromwell and Nardello also found that the FTX group made several donations to entities affiliated with Bahamian government officials and their families,” Mr Cleary wrote. “For example, the FTX group sent $500,000 as a purported donation to an entity owned by relatives of a high-ranking Bahamian government official. “In addition, the FTX group donated $175,000 to other entities affiliated with family members of high-ranking Bahamian government officials. Finally, Sullivan & Cromwell and Nardello’s investigation identified other contacts between the FTX group and Bahamian government officials.” No names or identities were disclosed by the FTX examiner. However, there is no doubt that Mr Cleary, Mr Ray and their teams know who the “entities”, families and “officials” are as the report references that these details came from a Nardello report dated May 13, 2023, which is titled: ‘Issues concerning Bahamian insolvency proceedings involving FTX’. Also mentioned as a source for the $675,000 payment information is a Sullivan & Cromwell report dated March 15, 2024, and described as a ‘Review of post-petition investigations for examiner’. The information in these documents and Mr Cleary’s report will also be available to the US Department of Justice. The findings do not distinguish between Cabinet ministers/MPs and top civil servants in employing the term “official”. Nor do they say whether the “government officials” are affiliated with the FNM or PLP. While FTX’s collapse occurred under the Davis administration, the crypto exchange first arrived in The Bahamas - and was licensed - under its Minnis predecessor. Tribune Business research, using prior Supreme Court reports by FTX Digital Markets’ liquidators, shows the crypto exchange’s Bahamian subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2021, and licensed and registered to operate in The Bahamas under the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Act on September 10 that year. That would have occurred under the Minnis administration just six days before the general election. Former prime minister, Dr Hubert Minnis, could not be reached for comment yesterday but previously told this newspaper he could not recall seeing or dealing with any of FTX’s permit applications during his time in office. “They never reached us,” he said. “They never came before any committee I chaired or sat on.”’ Mr Pintard, in a written statement issued last night, urged: “To protect the Bahamas’ reputation as a credible and legitimate place to do business, the Prime Minister must immediately agree to launch a complete and thorough investigation into these allegations of potential public corruption. “Which companies received these monies, and who were the ultimate beneficiaries of the funds? What purposes were the monies paid out for? Did the senior government officials involved declare the conflict of interests? Were these senior government officials in positions that directly or indirectly influence decisions impacting FTX, its competitors or the digital marketplace? “Do the Bahamian court-appointed liquidators have access to this information regarding nearly $700,000 in ‘donations’ to companies affiliated with high-ranking Bahamian officials and their families? Have the Bahamian liquidators put the matter forward to the authorities for further criminal investigation?” Mr Pintard urged the Prime Minister to “bring the same energy to investigating this matter as he has brought to investigations of alleged wrongdoing by Opposition members” in a thinly-veiled reference to the probes into the COVID-19 health travel visa and COVID-19 food programme. “We anticipate that the necessary investigation will examine the activities of all public officials who had spheres of influence over decisions related to FTX, regardless of political affiliation, before and after the change in administration. Let the proverbial chips fall where they may,” Mr Pintard added. “Let’s not forget that although the investigation and subsequent trial of now-convicted felon, Sam Bankman-Fried, uncovered a series of crimes that would also breach the DARE Act of The Bahamas, we have received no explanation for why those apparent breaches of Bahamian law were never thoroughly investigated and pursued. “We must look past partisan politics and work collaboratively across the aisle with industry stakeholders to ensure that our legislative, regulatory and policy framework can build a robust and nimble digital assets industry that attracts only credible entities committed to sound business practices,” the Opposition leader added. “The Prime Minister must ensure that the Bahamas government gets out front on the investigation and not be pressed to move by subsequent revelations from external sources. If the Davis administration shirks from its constitutional duty to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction from grave allegations of apparent misconduct by Bahamian public officials, the Prime Minister will yet again demonstrate to the Bahamian people and the global investment community that he and his Cabinet have neither the interest or the inclination to uphold the rule of law and the necessary standards of conduct in public life.”",

This half-length portrait is more than just an artistic masterpiece; it embodies the allure of an era marked by unparalleled cultural flourishing. Yet, beneath the surface of the Mona Lisa’s elusive smile lies a debate that touches the very essence of the Renaissance, its politics and the role of women in history. The intrigue of the Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda , isn’t solely due to Leonardo’s revolutionary painting techniques. It’s also because the identity of the subject is unconfirmed to this day. More than half a century since it was first painted, the real identity of the Mona Lisa remains one of art’s greatest mysteries, intriguing scholars and enthusiasts alike. The painting has traditionally been associated with Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. But another compelling theory suggests a different sitter: Isabella of Aragon. Isabella of Aragon was born into the illustrious House of Aragon in Naples, in 1470. She was a princess who was deeply entwined in the political and cultural fabric of the Renaissance. Her 1490 marriage to Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, positioned Isabella at the heart of Italian politics. And this role was both complicated and elevated by the ambitions and machinations of Ludovico Sforza (also called Ludovico il Moro), her husband’s uncle and usurper of the Milanese dukedom. The theory that Isabella is the real Mona Lisa is supported by a combination of stylistic analyses, historical connections and reinterpretations of Leonardo’s intent as an artist. In his biography of Leonardo , author Robert Payne points to preliminary studies by the artist that bear a striking resemblances to Isabella around age 20. Payne suggests Leonardo captured Isabella across different life stages , including during widowhood, as depicted in the Mona Lisa. US artist Lillian F. Schwartz’s 1988 study used x-rays to reveal an initial sketch of a woman hidden beneath Leonardo’s painting. This sketch was then painted over with Leonardo’s own likeness. Schwartz believes the woman in the sketch is Isabella, because of its similarity with a cartoon Leonardo made of the princess. She proposes the work was made by integrating specific features of the initial model with Leonardo’s own features. This hypothesis is further supported by art historians Jerzy Kulski and Maike Vogt-Luerssen . According to Vogt-Luerssen’s detailed analysis of the Mona Lisa, the symbols of the Sforza house and the depiction of mourning garb both align with Isabella’s known life circumstances. They suggest the Mona Lisa isn’t a commissioned portrait, but a nuanced representation of a woman’s journey through triumph and tragedy. Similarly, Kulski highlights the portrait’s heraldic designs , which would be atypical for a silk merchant’s wife. He, too, suggests the painting shows Isabella mourning her late husband. The Mona Lisa’s enigmatic expression also captures Isabella’s self-described state post-1500 of being “ alone in misfortune ”. Contrary to representing a wealthy, recently married woman, the portrait exudes the aura of a virtuous widow. Late professor of art history Joanna Woods-Marsden suggested the Mona Lisa transcends traditional portraiture and embodies Leonardo’s ideal, rather than being a straightforward commission. This perspective frames the work as a deeply personal project for Leonardo, possibly signifying a special connection between him and Isabella. Leonardo’s reluctance to part with the work also indicates a deeper, personal investment in it. The theory that Isabella of Aragon could be the true Mona Lisa is a profound reevaluation of the painting’s context, opening up new avenues through which to appreciate the work. It elevates Isabella from a figure overshadowed by the men in her life, to a woman of courage and complexity who deserves recognition in her own right. Through her strategic marriage and political savvy, Isabella played a crucial role in the alliances and conflicts that defined the Italian Renaissance. By possibly choosing her as his subject, Leonardo immortalised her and also made a profound statement on the complexity and agency of women in a male-dominated society. The ongoing debate over Mona Lisa’s identity underscores this work’s significance as a cultural and historical artefact. It also invites us to reflect on the roles of women in the Renaissance and challenge common narratives that minimise them. In this light, it becomes a legacy of the women who shaped the Renaissance.",

        "content": "RORY McIlroy and Shane Lowry are amongst the favourites as the PGA Tour heads to Hamilton for the RBC Canadian Open this week. The PGA Tour will return to familiar territory for the pair from the island of Ireland after a five-year hiatus. Rory McIlroy is a two-time winner of the Canadian Open, winning two of the last three titles, with the last in 2022. There have only been three played since 2019 as the pandemic saw the cancellation of the 2020 and 2021 editions. And the Holywood hotshot took that title a year prior to back-to-back cancellations. He emerged victorious at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Ancaster, Ontario with an impressive final round of 61, finishing at 22-under-par, seven strokes ahead of the runner-up. And that runner-up was none other than the world number three's pal, Shane Lowry . Both are coming off a recent win playing together at the PGA Tour's only team event, The 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans . The pair have engaged in a number of singles shootouts, Offaly star Lowry finished ahead of 35-year-old McIlroy at the 2022 PGA BMW Championship at Wentworth. 2019 Open Champ Lowry finished on -17, two shots ahead of McIlroy and Jon Rahm. And this week's stop in the Maple Leaf country could be an exciting one for Irish golf fans with both in solid form on the tour - especially considering the venue - when Rors won by seven-strokes from Lowry and Simpson, who placed second in 2019. Four-time major winner McIlroy recently won the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow, while Lowry is coming off a sixth place finish at the USPGA Championship . McIlory is 4th in the current FEDEX Cup standing, while Clara ace Lowry is 10th. Both are priced amongst the top-5 favourites with the Northern Irishman a 10/3 favourite to win a third Canadian Open as Lowry sits at what could be a generous 20/1. Canadian Nick Taylor won last year at Oakdale after he holed out a 72-foot putt for eagle to win during a playoff against Tommy Fleetwood. In doing so, he became the first Canadian citizen to win their national open since 1954, and the first born in Canada to win it since 1914. But on it's return to Hamilton Golf and Country Club, which last hosted the Canadian Open in 2019, Ryder Cup pals McIlroy and Lowry will fancy their chances at the event in Ontario. All the action is live on Sky Sports from Thursday.",

        "content": "XDefiant is taking the FPS world by storm and as the popularity of Ubisoft’s Arena Shooter increases, the challenge Ubisoft now faces is to cut cheaters out of the picture. Many people have begun to encounter issues and negative experiences while trying out Ubisoft’s FTP Arena Shooter. Some players have been seen or going a step further, using hacks to ruin games. Members of the game’s community have been turning to Ubisoft’s official channels to report these issues, mostly to XDefiant’s official X account, where their are public for all to see. Though, some have been expecting more from Ubisoft in terms of tackling these issues head-on. On May 27, one user took to to report a cheater in their game – and this is something I have also experienced in games on European servers but not yet screenshotted. They said: “How lame do you have to be to cheat in a game that came out 5 days ago?” Before this, other Reddit users also having flagrant cases of cheating during their matches: “Not even 3 days after launch and we already have cheaters in the game. I was in a match where this one guy on the enemy team got over 80 kills with a vector just lasering everyone across all ranges. Nothing but him on the kill feed.” Some have said that if this issue is not resolved promptly, “the game will .” And though this is only the opinion of a moderate group among XDefiant’s community, if a problem persists for too long, it could quickly escalate into an uncontrollable chain reaction. FPS players are no strangers to similar events, with the likes of Star Wars Battlefront, Battlefield, , Apex, , and many others suffering the same fate. Cheating is a serious issue and one of the top reasons why players stop playing a trending game. The internal seems to work just fine, though its anti-cheat engine, BattleEye, could definitely use some improvements to detect cases of cheating on the go. A clear example of a dynamic anti-cheat engine is , which spots cheaters during gameplay and immediately kicks or bans them depending on the gravity of their foul play. Due to its zero-tolerance policy, some users have filed complaints about unfair bans happening for in the past. While of open lines of communication with the players have proven to be a powerful tool to improve Early Access games, XDefiant is a totally different case. The game is already in its Preseason stage, and a full launch led to a considerable increase in popularity. If Ubisoft want to keep enjoying XDefiant’s success, they should probably follow the example of developers. Hear out the players and keep their anti-cheat system up to date to stop the snowball before it comes crashing down.",

        "content": "Pitso Mosimane's Abha FC were officially relegated on the final day of the Saudi Pro League season after losing to Al-Hazm on Monday night. Abha came into the encounter with their fate in their own hands after late win over Al Khaleej last Thursday, which took them out of the relegation zone. The former Al Ahly tactician made just one change from the win against Al Khaleej, Meshal Al Mutain came in at right-back for Fahad Jumayah. While the first half proved to be quiet affair in terms of chances for the visitors, Abha went ahead two minutes after the break courtesy of a strike from Ahmed Abdu Jaber. The visitors were unable to hold on to that lead for long as Al-Hazm restored parity in the 58th minute, with Muhammed Badamosi getting his name on the score-sheet. Al-Hazm completed the turnaround with ten minutes left on the clock when Mohammed Al-Thani fired past goalkeeper Anton Tataru?anu to seal the win, which was the fourth of the season. As a result, Mosimane's side have officially been relegated as Al Alkhdoud moved to 15th position after defeating fellow relegation rivals Al-Tai, who finish the campaign in 17th position, one place behind Abha. It remains to be seen where Mosimane's future will lie as he only signed a with the Saudi club back in January. You must be to read and post comments",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch that sees its turret spinning out of control while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 13:52 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:11 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 97 View comments Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. The Russian T-90 tank was seen spinning out of control due to a bug dubbed 'spinning turret syndrome' Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s (pictured) before it malfunctioned Another piece of footage captured the moment another T-90 began spinning out of control The machine crashed into a tree which stopped the rotating However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. The impressive T-90 has been hit with an embarrassing bug where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls The T-90 tank is a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world' Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

        "description": "Blake Snell is starting today's game as he awaits the birth of his first child, and manager Melvin keeps options open for Tuesday pitching plan.",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO – Blake Snell will start Monday on the pitcher’s mound, and he may end the day as a father. The 31-year-old left-hander was reinstated from the paternity list on Sunday and will make his scheduled start as his girlfriend, Haeley Mar, is still awaiting the birth of the couple’s first child. Her due date was last Monday, and Snell flew back from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area after his Wednesday start against the Pirates . Snell, the reigning National League Cy Young award winner, has struggled in orange and black since signing a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. He failed to make it past the fifth inning in any of his first three starts in April, and then he went on the injured list with a left groin injury. After dominating the minor leagues during his rehab stint, Snell surrendered four earned runs in 3 1⁄3 innings during his May 22 return against the Pirates. Giants manager Bob Melvin saw reasons to be optimistic after the latest start. “Incremental progress across the board,” Melvin said. “He was pretty good there early on. They made him throw a lot of pitches and it got away once he came out of the game, but I thought his stuff was a lot better.” The longtime manager was cagey when asked about the plan for Tuesday, with a vague “TBD” listed as the San Francisco starter facing former Giants first-round pick Zack Wheeler on the MLB website, before Kyle Harrison is slated to start on Wednesday. Mason Black, who filled that spot in the rotation through much of the last month after making his major league debut May 6, was optioned to Triple-A on Friday to make room for reliever Drew Pomeranz. In Thursday’s win over the Pirates, Black allowed four runs (all earned) in 2 2/3 innings, the third time in his four starts that he gave up at least that many runs. “I think anything is on the table,” Melvin said. “Whether we want to piece it together, whether we go with a regular starter or we call someone from the minor league side.” Brett Wisely will make his third consecutive start at shortstop after getting seven hits in his last three games. The 25-year-old from Jacksonville is batting .438 in 16 at-bats, but perhaps most importantly, has not committed an error. Related Articles “Brett’s been great, and that’s why he’s out there,” Melvin said. “We always talk about how if you get here and you perform, we’re going to find a place for you to play.” He has replaced top prospect Marco Luciano, who is hitting .391 but also committed five errors in the first five games of the Giants’ road trip before being sat for the finale against the New York Mets. Luciano isn’t totally in the doghouse, but he’s firmly behind Wisely. “Marco will get in the game here in this series, probably against lefties, but right now Brett is swinging the bat well and that’s why he’s in there.”",

The 25-year-old from Jacksonville is batting .438 in 16 at-bats, but perhaps most importantly, has not committed an error. “Brett’s been great, and that’s why he’s out there,” Melvin said. “We always talk about how if you get here and you perform, we’re going to find a place for you to play.” He has replaced top prospect Marco Luciano, who is hitting .391 but also committed five errors in the first five games of the Giants’ road trip before being sat for the finale against the New York Mets. Luciano isn’t totally in the doghouse, but he’s firmly behind Wisely. “Marco will get in the game here in this series, probably against lefties, but right now Brett is swinging the bat well and that’s why he’s in there.”",

        "description": "Blake Snell is starting today's game as he awaits the birth of his first child, and manager Melvin keeps options open for Tuesday pitching plan.",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO – Blake Snell will start Monday on the pitcher’s mound, and he may end the day as a father. The 31-year-old left-hander was reinstated from the paternity list on Sunday and will make his scheduled start as his girlfriend, Haeley Mar, is still awaiting the birth of the couple’s first child. Her due date was last Monday, and Snell flew back from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area after his Wednesday start against the Pirates . Snell, the reigning National League Cy Young award winner, has struggled in orange and black since signing a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. He failed to make it past the fifth inning in any of his first three starts in April, and then he went on the injured list with a left groin injury. After dominating the minor leagues during his rehab stint, Snell surrendered four earned runs in 3 1⁄3 innings during his May 22 return against the Pirates. Giants manager Bob Melvin saw reasons to be optimistic after the latest start. “Incremental progress across the board,” Melvin said. “He was pretty good there early on. They made him throw a lot of pitches and it got away once he came out of the game, but I thought his stuff was a lot better.” The longtime manager was cagey when asked about the plan for Tuesday, with a vague “TBD” listed as the San Francisco starter facing former Giants first-round pick Zack Wheeler on the MLB website, before Kyle Harrison is slated to start on Wednesday. Mason Black, who filled that spot in the rotation through much of the last month after making his major league debut May 6, was optioned to Triple-A on Friday to make room for reliever Drew Pomeranz. In Thursday’s win over the Pirates, Black allowed four runs (all earned) in 2 2/3 innings, the third time in his four starts that he gave up at least that many runs. “I think anything is on the table,” Melvin said. “Whether we want to piece it together, whether we go with a regular starter or we call someone from the minor league side.” Brett Wisely will make his third consecutive start at shortstop after getting seven hits in his last three games.

        "description": "The Bahamas Petroleum Retailers Association’s (BPRA) vice-president yesterday revealed the Government may give up “a bit” of its gasoline tax revenues to facilitate a margin increase for dealers.",
        "content": "By NEIL HARTNELL Tribune Business Editor nhartnell@tribunemedia.net The Bahamas Petroleum Retailers Association’s (BPRA) vice-president yesterday revealed the Government may give up “a bit” of its gasoline tax revenues to facilitate a margin increase for dealers. Vasco Bastian told Tribune Business that he is presently “the happiest I’ve ever been” over the 27-month negotiations with the Davis administration after Michael Halkitis, minister of economic affairs, disclosed on Friday that the Government was “tweaking some proposals” in a hope to resolve the situation “within the next couple of weeks”. Describing the potential resolution as a “two-for-one deal”, where the interests of motorists, business and gas station entrepreneurs were protected, the Association vice-president explained that it would result in a “small but significant” margin increase that dealers have been clamouring for as critical to their survival. Mr Bastian, asserting that the industry can now “see some light at the end of the tunnel”, told this newspaper that the proposed resolution is structured so that there is no major increase to prices at the pump while taking gas station operators “back to where we were 13 years ago”. That was when the industry received its last margin increase under then then-Ingraham administration. Unlike virtually all other industries, which are able to increase prices to cover rising operating expenses, the Bahamian petroleum industry operates on price-controlled fixed margins that require government approval before they can be changed. Dealers say that, especially following the post-COVID cost of living crisis, ever-rising expenses have effectively wiped out the 54 cent and 34-cent margins per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold, driving them into losses and placing some in a position where they are threatening to close their operations. The Government, though, has been reluctant to raise the margins for fear it will increase fuel bills for motorists. Mr Bastian, yesterday describing himself as “elated” over the position currently reached with the Government, told Tribune Business he is not fully celebrating just yet until the Association receives official confirmation “in black and white” that all parties are agreed. “We met with minister Halkitis a couple of weeks ago. We met briefly with Simon Wilson [the Government’s financial secretary] a few weeks ago. They indicated the same thing to us,” he said of Mr Halkitis’ Friday remarks that the Government wanted to have the negotiations “out the way” and resolved shortly. “We feel as if we will get an improvement, the Government will make an adjustment on their end and they will pass the revenues on to us.... I’m elated. I’m just waiting for the Government to formally put it in black and white. We’ve been at it for 27 years. This is the happiest I’ve ever been in negotiations with the Government. “It speaks volumes to the Prime Minister’s commitment to small business owners in the petroleum industry. This is what good governments do; they take care of all. He’s making sure that the consumers won’t be impacted significantly, and making sure the revenues he will lose... He loses a bit from his side and gives that to us.” When asked by Tribune Business whether the Government is mulling whether to give up a small portion of its petroleum tax take to facilitate the dealers’ margin increase demand, in a bid to ensure the impact for consumers and gas pump prices is minimised, Mr Bastian replied: “Exactly, exactly. “That’s what good governments do. They look out for the masses and Bahamian entrepreneurs. It’s a two-for-one deal, a two-for-one deal. I couldn’t be happier. I will be even happier when once we get it in black and white. We will definitely survive. We will definitely survive.” When gasoline was priced at $5.48 per gallon, the Association broke it down to show that $1.32 or 24.04 percent - almost one-quarter - of this figure goes to the Government via its ad valorem tax. Dealers and wholesalers, respectively, receive 9.86 percent and 6.21 percent with their 54 cents and 34 cent margins, with VAT adding another 50 cents once the $2.78 landed cost is factored in. Gasoline and diesel-related taxes are thus among the Government’s strongest and most reliable revenue generators, especially given that there will always be demand for these commodities. Reducing the Public Treasury’s earnings from these income streams would also go against its earlier stance, as Mr Halkitis previously said it would have to make up the lost revenue from other taxes and fees. Mr Halkitis, on Friday, said that “without promising anything” the Government and petroleum dealers were inching towards resolution. “We’re moving closer. We’re moving closer. We continue to talk,” he said. “Our main thing, and it has not changed, I looked at the newspaper this morning and fuel prices were $5.91, $5.90 and maybe $5.95” from the three petroleum companies. “Our concern has always been the impact on the driving public and, when we talk about the diesel, we talk about the impact on the bus drivers and the fishermen and that sort of thing,” Mr Halkitis added. However, he acknowledged that the price-controlled fixed margins have placed dealers “in a difficult environment” and the Government remains “sympathetic to their plight”. “Without sort of promising anything, we’re moving closer,” the minister said. “I understand they’re [the dealers] very anxious, they’ve been very patient and continue to endure a difficult environment. We’re not unsympathetic. We’re looking, and hopefully in the coming weeks we will be able to announce some solution or compromise. “We don’t want Bahamians automatically to go out to the pump and there’s a higher price. It’s a balancing act. We understand these are Bahamian entrepreneurs who have invested money, taken their life’s savings, gone into debt and are struggling to make it. We’re not unsympathetic to that. “But, on the other side, is the Bahamian driver. We’re just tweaking some proposals where we can minimise the increase, and want to get that resolved and out of the way within the next couple of weeks.” And Mr Bastian, staying upbeat, said: “We will all be happy at the end of the day. That’s what good governments do. “At the end of this exercise, the Prime Minister and his team will look like heroes all around. The Prime Minister is doing something that’s not been done in 13 years. The margin increase is small but significant to us. We will thank him officially once we get it in black and white and pay a courtesy call on him. “This is good stuff. This is truly a new day for gas station operators in this country once we get it in black and white. It’s been 27 months of negotiations and pleading with the Government. It sends a message to small businesses in this country that you must stay the course and remain committed in negotiations with the Government,” Mr Bastian continued. “I will only celebrate once I get the documents in hand, and then I will really, really celebrate. Just now I’m waiting to get that official letter. It’s any day now. God is good. This will be very significant. It will be a huge boost [to us] as everything has gone up around us - electricity, NIB, Business Licence; all of these things. “It [the proposed margin increase] brings us back to where we were over 13 years ago. We will see some light again. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Last time we got a margin increase was under Hubert Ingraham. Perry Christie did not give us one, Dr Minnis did not give us one. God is good.”",

        "description": "Underwater rivers ferry large volumes of seaweed from shallow seas into the deep, where its carbon is stored naturally",
        "content": "Deep in the ocean lies the world’s largest active carbon reservoir, which plays a pivotal role in buffering our planet’s climate. Of the roughly 10 billion tonnes carbon dioxide we emit each year, about 3 billion tonnes are taken up and stored in the oceans – and largely by plants. When we consider natural carbon storage in the deep oceans, we generally focus on phytoplankton. Trillions of these microscopic plants live in the surface waters all across the oceans. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, transporting carbon to the depths . But there’s a missing piece of the puzzle. Our two new studies show coastal vegetation such as seaweed forests are more important to natural carbon storage than we thought. Around 56 million tonnes of carbon in the form of seaweed is carried into the deep ocean each year. For carbon to be stored for hundreds of years, it has to enter slow cycling pools of carbon in the deep ocean. But most seaweeds only grow in shallow coastal seas. How can they get there? For decades, deep sea explorers have reported surprising findings. Pieces of seaweed and other coastal plants appear where they shouldn’t be. Fragments of seaweed are often caught in deep-sea trawls , or recorded by submarines and underwater robots during surveys of the ocean floor . Seaweed DNA has been detected in deep sea water and sediments in all of the world’s oceans, as deep as 4 kilometres down and up to 5,000 km from the closest seaweed forest . But how can seaweeds travel that distance? Our team discovered part of the answer. Seaweed can be carried by large “ underwater rivers ”, which flow from coastal waters along the seafloor across the continental shelf and into the deep. These currents form when localised cooling causes cold dense coastal water to rapidly sink below warmer offshore surface waters. The dense water slides down the slope of the seafloor, following the topography like a river, and carrying with it large quantities of seaweed to deeper areas. In Western Australia, these flows of seaweed and coastal vegetation towards the deep ocean happen most during colder months, when conditions allow these underwater rivers to form. During these months, storms often hit coastal waters, ripping up seaweed and filling the water with seaweed fragments. These underwater rivers are a well-documented phenomenon in Australia. But are these ocean currents transporting seaweed and their carbon elsewhere? We worked with an international team of scientists to find out. To do so, we tracked seaweed from coastal waters to the deep ocean using advanced ocean models. Our findings were clear. Seaweed forests do, in fact, transfer substantial amounts of carbon to the deep ocean in many parts of the world . This phenomenon is particularly high in the kelp forests of Australia’s Great Southern Reef , which stretches 8,000 km from Kalbarri in Western Australia to Coolangatta in Queensland. The seaweed forests of the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia and Chile are also carbon transport hotspots. While phytoplankton still sink vast amounts of carbon, our discovery suggests the plants of the coastal ocean transfer more carbon than we thought. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass all contribute to these flows of carbon, but seaweed forests are really big contributor. These forests are made up of large brown algae such as kelp and rockweed species, which form extensive hidden forests . Seaweed forests – such as Tasmania’s disappearing giant kelp forests – are the largest and most productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. Globally, these forests cover an area twice the size of India, and fix as much carbon during their growth as the northern forests of Canada – nearly 1 billion tonnes a year. Of this carbon, our research suggests between 10 and 170 million tonnes makes it to the deep ocean every year. Many of us don’t give seaweed much thought. But underwater seaweed forests play a vital role. These forests give shelter and home to huge numbers of fish and other marine species. They improve water quality and boost biodiversity. And now we know they help store carbon for hundreds of years. Like many other ecosystems, underwater forests are at risk. Hotter seas from climate change, coastal development, pollution and overfishing have pushed seaweed forests to die off faster than most other coastal ecosystems. Their fate has worsened in recent decades. The ocean is getting hotter, faster, bringing with it longer lasting and more frequent marine heatwaves . In Tasmania, the heating ocean has brought new species to seaweed forests, which now have subtropical fish species and voracious sea urchins. These urchins are chewing through the state’s kelp forests. In Western Australia, a severe marine heatwave struck in 2011, wiping out kelp forests along 100 km of coastline . These forests have not recovered. When we lose seaweed forests, we lose their natural ability to transfer carbon to the deep ocean. But their loss also threatens the other species who rely on them, and the half a trillion dollars of value they provide to us . We should think of conserving seaweed forests in the same way we do forests on land. Scaling up restoration where forests have been lost is vital to ensure these unsung plants can keep supporting us – and help store carbon.",

        "content": "PERJALANAN tidak selamanya mulus. Ada lubang, batu, dan beraneka ragam masalah yang terkadang mengganjal. Namun jangan khawatir. Tidak ada masalah yang abadi. Setiap masalah pasti berjodoh dengan solusi. Siapakah pembuka jalan keluar dari segenap masalah? Simak yuk salah satu ini. Jawaban pertanyaan di atas ialah siapa lagi kalau bukan Allah SWT. Allah tidak hanya mampu memberi jalan keluar dari setiap masalah. Terhadap segala hal yang terkunci, Dia mampu membukanya melalui pertolongan. Terhadap segala kemusykilan, Dia dapat menyingkapnya lewat petunjuk. Oleh karena itulah, salah satu di antara asmaul husna ialah Al-Fattah. Salah satu asmaul husna ini berasal dari kata Al-Fatih berarti yang membuka. Ini dialih rupa menjadi Al-Fattah untuk tujuan mubalaghah (superlatif) sehingga artinya bertambah menjadi Yang Maha Membuka. Menurut Imam Al-Ghazali dalam Maqhsadul Asna, sekali waktu Allah membuka kekuasaan bagi para nabi-Nya agar bisa mengalahkan musuh-musuh mereka. Sekali waktu yang lain Dia menyingkap hijab (penghalang) dari hati para kekasih-Nya, sehingga mereka mampu menembus kerajaan langit dan mengagumi keindahan kebesaran-Nya. Imam Al-Ghazali juga menyebutkan bahwa berada dalam kekuasaan Allah-lah pembuka urusan ghaib dan pembuka pintu rezeki. Maka dari itu, kepada siapa lagi kita memohon pertolongan agar dibukakan bagi kita jalan keluar dari segala kesulitan? Kepada siapa lagi kita meminta agar dibukakan bagi kita pintu rezeki dan segala kebaikan lain? (OL-14)",

        "content": "The 22-year-old defender joined the Magpies on a free transfer from RB Leipzig in March 2021 but has now left the club on a permanent deal. During his tenure at Newcastle, Bondswell had loan spells at Shrewsbury Town and Newport County, gaining valuable experience in the Football League. Despite these opportunities, he failed to secure a regular first-team spot at Newcastle. Announcing his departure, Bondswell took to social media platform X, posting an emotional farewell message: “My time at Newcastle has come to an end. I’ll be leaving with many great memories and I want to thank everyone who has been a part of that so thank you to the fans for your support, it’s been an honour to be able to wear the black and white shirt in front of you.” Newcastle’s Upcoming Transfer Window Newcastle United are expected to have a busy transfer window as manager Eddie Howe aims to revive the squad following a disappointing season. They are expected to make several changes, with quite a few expected to leave in order for the club to adhere with the Financial Fairplay rules, which would then allow them to invest in incomings. Eddie Howe’s strategic overhaul is geared towards improving Newcastle’s performance next season. The club’s focus will be on balancing the books while enhancing the squad’s quality, ensuring they can compete at a higher level.",

        "description": "FTX’s $256m Bahamian property empire is set to “hit the market within the next 30 days” after five to seven local realtors were selected to handle their disposal.",
        "content": "By NEIL HARTNELL Tribune Business Editor nhartnell@tribunemedia.net FTX’s $256m Bahamian property empire is set to “hit the market within the next 30 days” after five to seven local realtors were selected to handle their disposal. Realtors spoken to by Tribune Business said the high-end international market for Bahamian real estate is more than capable of absorbing the one-time influx of 34 properties purchased by the collapsed crypto exchange, one going so far as to describe their impending listing-for-sale as a “drop in the bucket”. All confirmed that FTX’s Bahamian liquidators, chiefly the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) accounting duo of Kevin Cambridge and Peter Greaves, have recently started issuing confirmations to the Bahamian realtors selected to list, market and sell properties that represent a significant source of recovery for investors and creditors. This newspaper understands that the high-end residential and commercial properties have been split-up between as many as five to seven realtors as the Bahamian liquidators seek to maximise the sales prices for the benefit of creditors and also to fulfill the terms of their agreement with John Ray, FTX’s US chief who heads the 134 entities currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware. Matthew Marco, marketing director and licensed realtor with Bond Bahamas, voiced optimism that the high-end market will have no difficulty dealing with an FTX-led surge in inventory as he confirmed the company is among those selected to sell those properties. “I seriously think it’s a drop in the bucket. Everybody will forget about this in a few years,” he said of the FTX properties. “There’s more than enough people to buy this inventory at full asking price. There’s no discounting at all. We have a handful of listings that will go on the market within two weeks.” Asserting that “it doesn’t take a lot to move the needle here”, Mr Marco cited as an example the 70,000 wealthy individuals and families potentially looking for new homes and jurisdictions as a result of the UK’s upcoming changes to non-domicile tax laws and rules next year. “If 0.1 percent decide they want to move to The Bahamas that’s 70 families,” he explained. “There’s not 70 properties here for them. We’re not Miami, New York or Toronto where you need thousands of people. You only need a handful of people to move the needle. That’s all it takes.” Mario Carey, founder of Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate MCR Group, told this newspaper that disposing of the FTX properties will be more complex than a traditional real estate sale since the Bahamian liquidators are answerable to the Supreme Court and have a fiduciary duty to creditors to achieve the best possibly sales price. “The process has been advanced. They’re moving in that direction where they went out to prime brokers,” Mr Carey said of the liquidators’ selection process that began in mid-February 2024. “I guess the properties will hit the market in the next 30 days. “There are many things that we have to pay attention to. You’re going to get a lot of bottom feeders who think they can come in and get discounts. You will have property owners in some some communities who feel that deals will be cut that will devalue their properties. “I think the market will absorb them without any issues because the demand is still strong. You will find wealthy owners will probably come into the market to protect themselves and protect their flock. If a guy can afford a $20m condo, he will come into the market and buy these assets. They can donate them to their children. It’s going to be an interesting end result. We’ve never seen this before - $270m of inventory hitting the market.” David Morley, Morley Realty’s principal, made a similar prediction. “Two days ago we got an e-mail from the liquidators indicating they have selected us to represent them on one of the commercial properties,” he told Tribune Business. “We did not get everything we bid for. “There was one of the Pineapple House properties, and the acreage at Blake Road and West Bay Street where they were going to build the headquarters. We also bid on Veridian Corporate Centre, and we were selected for Veridian Corporate Centre. Now we have to move forward trying to meet with them [the liquidators]. They want to see our terms of engagement and everything is subject to contract. “It looks like they are moving forward, making decisions. We’ll see marketing of those assets very shortly. I would anticipate that, within two to three weeks, you will see marketing of those assets. There’s still work that has to be done in advance of marketing them.” This, Mr Morley said, included realtors completing listing agreements with FTX’s Bahamian liquidators. “I think it’s going to help,” he added of the inventory influx. “There are people in the market waiting to possibly pounce on those assets, thinking they can pick them up for pennies on the dollar, when the liquidators have to prove to the court they’ve achieved the best possible price. “For the residential stuff and the high-end side it’s going to help the market in adding inventory back to it. On the commercial side, I’m not that ambitious about it. I don’t think there’s as much demand on the commercial side as there clearly is on the residential side. At least we’re one step closer. The wait is almost over. Now we have some work to do.” Another high-end realtor, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed. “They are now appointing the agents for the FTX properties. It’s getting done. They’re getting close. I’m happy they are. It looks like I have a lot of work ahead of me,” he added. The Bahamian liquidators, in launching their request for “expressions of interest” from Bahamian realtors in mid-February, confirmed that a total 34 properties are being readied for sale. Of this number, close to half - 16 - are located in the high-end Albany community in south-western New Providence, featuring a number of three to seven-bedroom condos and one separate residential dwellings. Of the remainder, eight are one-two bed condos located in the GoldWynn development on Goodman’s Bay, while another four units are in the One Cable Beach complex on Cable Beach. The final six properties include the Ocean Terrace gated residential condo building, with 16 units and leisure facilities, on West Bay Street, plus two residences in Old Fort Bay. The balance consist of commercial real estate, including the 4,000 square foot Pineapple House; FTX’s former Bahamian head office at the Veridian Corporate Centre on Western Road; and undeveloped land on West Bay Street and Blake Road. The 16 properties at Albany, 15 of which are condominiums, were bought at price points between $4.75m and $30m. The seven units acquired in the GoldWynn project at Goodman’s Bay were valued between $563,520 and $1.449m. Four units, varying in value from $975,000 to $1.54m, were purchased in the One Cable Beach project. Some $26.34m was spent on acquiring multiple units at the Veridian Corporate Centre, with further outlays of $17.435m, $9m and $1.8m on property at Ocean Terrace, Old Fort Bay and Pineapple House respectively. Under the terms of the Bahamian liquidators’ agreement with Mr Ray, all 34 properties must fetch a price that is “equal to or greater than 80 percent” of their broker-appraised values. The deal stipulates that “the aggregate sale price with respect to each Bahamas property sold pursuant to the sale is equal to or greater than 80 percent of the price stated in a broker price opinion produced by a real estate broker licensed in The Bahamas”.",

        "description": "An airstrike on a tent camp in the Gaza city has killed dozens including children.",
        "content": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel on 24 May is both more and less complicated than it initially appears. To avoid a plausible harm to Palestinians’ rights under the Genocide Convention , the court ordered Israel to curtail its military invasion of Gaza’s southern-most city of Rafah, where 1.4 million Palestinians had been sheltering. Compliance would save countless lives. Yet if Israel ignores the legally binding decision, enforcement efforts will turn to the UN Security Council, where the US veto is an obstacle. The US government is not the only problem. The difficulty of enforcement begins with the court’s own decision. Although much of the media reported an order to “ immediately halt ” Israel’s Rafah offensive, the actual language was more ambiguous. The court ordered Israel to “immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ” (emphasis added). The “conditions of life” language comes from the Genocide Convention. Is the court saying that the Rafah offensive must stop because it could lead to destructive conditions of life, or that it should stop insofar as it leads to those conditions? It can be argued both ways. The Israeli government predictably read it to require halting the Rafah invasion only insofar as it created destructive conditions of life. So did the court’s Romanian judge . Israel said it had not imposed those conditions to date, which is demonstrably false; the court found that the “catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had deteriorated further” since its first order in January. But Israel also vowed that its future military operations in Rafah would not impose such conditions, which respects the language of the court’s order, even if history suggests that Israel’s actions are unlikely to do so. Two days after the court’s ruling, on 26 May, an Israeli airstrike on a tent camp for displaced people in western Rafah killed at least 45 people including 23 women, children, and older people, and wounded 249. Following international condemnation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the following day that the strike was a “mistake” but didn’t address the rules of engagement that had permitted an airstrike in the middle of a densely populated tent camp filled with civilians. Why was the court so ambiguous? We don’t know for sure. It may have been necessary to secure the overwhelmingly positive vote – 13 to 2, with only the Israeli and Ugandan judges opposed. Or it may have reflected the court’s awareness that, when it comes down to it, it is just 15 judges in robes with no coercive capacity beyond their power of persuasion. They may have felt that sticking to the language of the Genocide Convention was more prudent. By contrast, the court was unconditional in ordering Israel to open the Rafah border crossing to Egypt “for unhindered provision at scale of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance” and to “ensure unimpeded access to the Gaza Strip” by any UN investigator into allegations of genocide. So far, with Israeli troops having taken over the Rafah border crossing, humanitarian aid passing through it has stopped . And Israel has not allowed any investigator into Gaza from the UN or the International Criminal Court (ICC). Might the Security Council act to back the court? The US government has a long history of using its veto to block action against Israel, but there have been rare exceptions. In March, for instance, the US abstained to allow the council to demand an “ immediate ,” though temporary, ceasefire in Gaza. But the Biden administration immediately undercut the resolution by claiming, falsely, that it was “ nonbinding ”. It is not out of the question that Joe Biden would allow a Security Council resolution on Rafah. After all, his administration has been pressing the Israeli government not to invade the city – a supposed “ red line ” — and to stop obstructing humanitarian aid. But if it permitted a Security Council resolution, it would likely parallel the court’s ambiguous language, which would allow Israel the same unsatisfactory response. Biden has other leverage at his disposal. He could condition further US arms sales or military aid on the Rafah offensive stopping. To avoid use in Rafah, he did suspend delivery of the massive 2,000-pound bombs that Israel had been using repeatedly to pulverise Gaza neighbourhoods, but the significance of that move was lessened by the announcement that $1 billion of other US arms deliveries would move forward. Yet the Biden administration is already hedging on its stand against an invasion of Rafah. The Israeli government has been describing the invasion as a “ limited operation ,” despite 800,000 Palestinians having fled. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says that Israel has made “ refinements ” to spare civilians that seem in his view to make the military operation so far acceptable. The White House’s response to the 26 May attack was to say that it reportedly had killed “two senior Hamas terrorists,” as if that justified the huge civilian toll, but to urge, yet again, that “Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians”. There was no condemnation. But the US government, important as it is, is not the only source of pressure on Israel. In ignoring the court’s Rafah ruling, Netanyahu puts his — and Israel’s — interests at considerable risk in other ways. The three ICJ Justice rulings since January have all imposed “ provisional measures ” against the possibility of genocide. A ruling on the merits of South Africa’s genocide case will come later, with the key issue being whether the devastation and large-scale loss of life that Israel has imposed on Palestinian civilians in Gaza was done with genocidal intent . The court is more likely to answer that question affirmatively if Israel ignores its preliminary protective rulings. On 20 May, Karim Khan, the prosecutor of the separate ICC, announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crime charges related to the starvation of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. (He also sought arrest warrants for three senior Hamas officials for atrocities on 7 October and the treatment of hostages.) Israeli defiance of the ICJ’s order would make it more likely that the ICC’s pretrial chamber affirms the charges against Netanyahu and Gallant and issues arrest warrants. It could also be used as evidence at trial. Two days after the ICC announcement, on 22 May, Spain, Ireland, and Norway recognised Palestine as a state – the only European governments to have done so other than Sweden. Their timing was clearly related to Israel’s conduct in Gaza. If there is one thing that Netanyahu hates more than Hamas, it is the prospect of a Palestinian state. That is why, until 7 October, he allowed Qatar to fund Hamas, calculating that a strong Hamas would relieve Israel of pressure to negotiate his dreaded two-state solution. Now, he refuses to plan for post-war governance of Gaza, even though the resulting vacuum makes Hamas’s return more likely, because he fears more the emergence of a prototype Palestinian state. If the Israeli government continues to ignore the ICJ ruling, more governments can be expected to recognise Palestine as a state. In short, it is a mistake to discount the court’s ruling as ambiguous and difficult to enforce.

        "content": "Business owners have lamented that the recent interest rate increase by the Central Bank of Nigeria would have negative effects on businesses in the country. Their reactions came on the heels of CBN’s third consecutive increase of the interest rates for loans since February when the Monetary Policy Committee of the apex bank resumed meeting this year. In all, the MPC has increased the interest rate by 750 basis points since February. The committee in February increased the interest rate by 400 basis points which was 22.75 per cent as against the initial 18.75 per cent. The committee had also increased the interest rate by 200 basis points which was 24.75 per cent in March before finally adding 150 basis points, which was 26.75 per cent in May. However, the economists and business owners said that the continued increase would affect several businesses and hinder business owners from accessing loans. Speaking in an interview with Sunday PRIMANEWS, the Chief Executive Officer of Royalty Stores, Adeola Olufunke, expressed concern over the prohibitive interest rates on loans, describing them as a significant barrier to business success. She said, “Right now, the loan is a no-go area because of the interest rate. How can one get a loan and pay 26 per cent and still be able to run the business successfully? It’s just too much,” she lamented. Also, the CEO of LogiTrak Africa, Stephen Fola-Badejo, explained that the interest rate had severely affected businesses, especially startups as the new rate had also increased the borrowing cost. He urged that the Federal Government to put measures in place to mitigate the negative consequences on businesses. He said, “The interest rate has severely affected businesses, especially startups, leading to increased borrowing costs. It leads to increased borrowing cost for consumers, reducing their disposable income and purchasing power, ultimately affecting businesses that rely on consumer spending.” A business owner at Agric in the Ikorodu area of Lagos, Mr Michael Bankole, also said the consistent increase in rate would ultimately lead to unemployment, saying, “Without loans, businesses will not improve, and if that becomes the case, business owners cannot employ. If we can’t employ, it will worsen the level of unemployment in the country.” Speaking on the economic implication of the CBN exchange rate, an economist and Professor of Economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University, Sheriffdeen Tella, said the interest rate increase would prevent many businesses from borrowing. He said, “The interest rates raised indicate what the banks should charge their customers. If the CBN is charging 26 per cent, how many businesses can generate up to that? They will not borrow money because it is too high. Many of them will close down. Also, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Muda Yusuf, expressed concern over the tightening monetary conditions, saying, “We have seen yet a further tightening of monetary conditions in the economy. My prayer was for the MPC to pause the rate hikes.” He emphasised that the previous rate hikes which have been aggressive are hurting output and real sector investments, adding that most economic operators with credit exposures to the banks have not recovered from the hikes. Similarly, a professor of Capital Market at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, explained that the hike in the interest rate would likely have an adverse consequence on the equities market given the relationship between interest rates and equities market returns. According to him, over-reliance on the MPR as a tool to tame the inflation rate appeared to have no meaningful impact due to the significant non-monetary factors driving the inflation in the country, including the high cost of energy, transport as well as insecurity.",

        "content": "Sergio Perez is seemingly hitting the same slump in form as he did after last year’s Miami GP. The Mexican started the 2024 season quite well with podium finishes right behind Max Verstappen. However, his qualifying struggles in Imola and Monaco and further lack of recovery in the races could ring the alarm bells at Red Bull. Yet, the Austrian team is reportedly offering him a contract extension for next year. According to Autosport , the reigning champions feel Perez is the best candidate available right now to partner Verstappen. While there are times when the #11 driver struggles to match the Dutchman’s pace, he has done an incredible job of backing his champion teammate up as a wingman. Regardless, Red Bull have been reluctant to secure Perez as their number two driver for 2025. After his form dropped off the cliff last season, the Milton Keynes outfit did not want to offer the 34-year-old another multi-year deal. Meanwhile, Perez has reportedly been adamant about wanting a minimum two-year deal. This mismatch of expectations has caused the delay in Red Bull’s decision on who will be Verstappen’s teammate for 2025. Now, the team’s advisor Helmut Marko stated that by the Spanish GP , they would give clarity on their driver choice for the vacant seat. However, Perez’s recent performances in Imola and Monaco may make the Austrian team wait further before finalizing their driver lineup. Now, the former Force India driver has been a great teammate for Verstappen. But, his struggles to be at the front of the field with Ferrari and McLaren closing the gap, could become a detriment for Red Bull . Why Sergio Perez needs to step up for his future and Red Bull’s sake Sergio Perez’s poor qualifying and DNF at the Monaco GP did not do any favor to his contract extension case. Meanwhile, as Ferrari and McLaren’s upgrades have enabled them to cut down the gap to Red Bull , they are inching closer to the championship leaders in the standings. For context, the Italian team is only 24 points behind the Bulls, closer than they have been since 2022. Thus, Perez cannot afford to slack off in qualifying like he did in Imola and Monaco. The Mexican driver could easily become a liability for the Milton Keynes outfit if Ferrari and McLaren keep competing like they have in the past three races. The same notion is quite valid for 2025 and beyond too and Red Bull would be aware of it. As a result, they would want to make the right choice for the long term rather than retaining Perez for the same reasons they did in 2022. Apart from Perez, Red Bull will have multiple drivers knocking on their door, if they decide to look for a replacement. As things stand, they are not willing to promote Yuki Tsunoda or Daniel Ricciardo from their sister team, RB. Meanwhile, Carlos Sainz has been hopeful of a top team seat, the Austrian team has reportedly turned his candidacy down.",

        "content": "There’s no shortage of great, if not amazing stocks to buy and hold for years right now on the market. And within that bucket of amazing stocks are several that trade at absurdly cheap levels. Here’s a look at three of those absurdly cheap stocks, and why they belong in your portfolio. ( ) is one of the best-known long-term investments on the market. The energy infrastructure behemoth operates the largest and most complex pipeline systems on the planet. That pipeline network includes both natural gas and crude elements, hauling massive amounts of both across North America. Specifically, Enbridge transports one-third of all North American-produced crude and nearly one-fifth of the natural gas needs of the U.S. Suffice it to say, that makes Enbridge an incredibly defensive stock option. But that’s not all Enbridge does. The company also boasts a growing business and a sizable natural gas utility. Both are defensive, growing, and provide ample revenue for Enbridge. This allows the company to invest in growth and pay a handsome dividend. That dividend currently boasts a yield of 7.4%, making it one of the better-paying options on the market. Enbridge has also given investors generous upticks to that dividend for three decades. Perhaps best of all, despite all that potential Enbridge trades down 13% in the trailing two years. This makes it one of the absurdly cheap stocks to buy and hold for decades. are among the best long-term options on the market. In short, they boast solid results, stellar growth, and a juicy yield making them great options for any investor. It doesn’t happen too often, but one of those big bank stocks is one of the absurdly cheap stocks to consider. Enter ( ). TD is the second largest of the big banks, and arguably one of the best absurdly cheap stocks to buy. TD boasts both a solid domestic segment and a lucrative international segment. Unfortunately, in recent months the bank has come under scrutiny, adding to its stock-price woes. Specifically, TD’s failure to comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and by extension, whatever penalties may get imposed, has put downward pressure on the stock. Any financial penalties imposed would seriously derail TD’s growth plans. But for , it makes the bank one of the absurdly cheap stocks to buy now. Prospective investors should note that TD’s primary growth driver was its U.S. business. If a decision comes down that slows or even halts that effort, TD will look to other means of fueling growth. Like using its capital reserves for share buybacks. This year TD has dipped nearly 10%, while all of its big bank peers are in the black. In fact, given the current stock price, TD trades at a P/E of just 12.9, while its dividend has swelled to 5.3%. One final stock that is absurdly cheap right now is ( ). BCE is one of Canada’s largest telecoms, offering subscription-based services including wireless, wireline, TV, and internet segments. Telecoms are also immensely capital-intensive businesses, which is why the stock has dropped in recent years as interest rates have surged. During that same time, BCE’s dividend, which the telecom has paid out for over a century without fail, has swelled to an insane 8.7%. That includes expected annual increases, the most recent being a 3% uptick this year. Prospective investors need to stay focused on the longer term. BCE’s stock price will recover once interest rates begin to drop. Furthermore, BCE’s cost-cutting efforts will reduce pressure on the company to slash its dividend. In short, prospective investors should consider this absurdly cheap stock right now and enjoy that 8.7% yield while it lasts. Finding the right mix of stocks takes time. More importantly, prospective investors should keep in mind that no stock, even the most defensive investment, is not without some risk. In my opinion, one or all stocks mentioned should be core holdings as part of every . Buy them as absurdly cheap stocks, hold them, and watch them grow.",

        "content": "The Canadian stock market has gained 11.03% since November 2023 due to mild and moderating inflation. Going into the last week of May 2024, the TSX is up 6.5% year to date, led by the energy sector’s +22.11%. Market analysts believe rate cuts will drive dividend expansion. A report by S&P Global Market Intelligence Dividend Forecasting (S&P Global MI DF) in January said that regular base dividend payouts would grow by an average of 6% year over year, with more than 50% coming from heavyweight sectors such as banking and energy. and ( ) are among the top picks for their generous dividend yields. However, most income-focused investors would find the energy stock more appealing for three reasons: lower share price ($10.35 vs. $65.27), higher yield (7.05% vs. 6.5%), and payout frequency (monthly vs. quarterly). Furthermore, Whitecap is up 19.64% year to date compared to +4.46% for BNS. Whitecap’s current dividend yield is exceedingly higher than the 4.7% industry average. But is the generous payout sustainable? Given the 57.9% payout ratio (BNS is 68.9%), it should be. Frequent dividend payments attract more income investors. Besides the steady income streams you can incorporate into your monthly budget, you can reinvest the dividends 12 times a year instead of four for faster principal compounding. With Whitecap Resources, a $17,025.75 investment (1,645 shares) transforms into a $100.03 monthly passive income. Assuming you don’t collect the dividends but reinvest them, your money will more than double to $34,386.50 in 10 years. The total dividend earnings of $17,360.75 represents a 101.97% money growth through the power of compounding. The $6.2 billion oil-weighted growth company operates in northwest Alberta (West division) and central Alberta (East division). Whitecap’s light oil resource base is the foundation for growth, while the portfolio of assets (petroleum and natural gas) delivers predictable cash flows. The low-decline light oil asset base also supports an internally funded business model. Whitecap’s exploration and production activities focus on the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin, competing with several companies of various sizes. Identifying, finding, and developing oil and gas reserves at economical costs and marketability of the oil and gas produced are perennial risks. Other business risks are the demand for oil and gas in North America, commodity prices, and currency exchange rates. Whitecap had an exceptional first quarter (Q1) of 2024, production-wise, owing to the record average production of 108,210 barrels per day (bbls/d) of light oil and liquids and 368,701 thousand cubic feet per day (mcf/d) of natural gas. Management said it was the most active quarter in the company’s history and expects the divisions to outperform in Q2. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, total revenues and net income declined 1.7% and 77.2% year over year to $868.3 million and $59.8 million. Nevertheless, the balance sheet remains strong due to the downside price protection. The total dividend payments of $109 million were 24% higher than in Q1 2023. Management is confident and comfortable about the sustainability of the current monthly dividend despite the constant stress on commodity prices. The commercial operation of the expanded TMX pipeline beginning in May 2024 is a tailwind. Market analysts recommend a buy rating for Whitecap Resources.",

        "content": "Photo: Nicholas Johansen The Kelowna courthouse A woman who was sexually assaulted in her Kelowna home by a stranger will have to come back to court again to deliver her victim impact statement. She was prepared to read out the 17-page document Monday at a sentencing hearing for Joshua Hawco. However, because she didn’t file the victim impact statement in accordance with requirements set out in the Criminal Code of Canada, the sentencing has been delayed. Last November, Hawco was found guilty of sexual assault by a jury in a case dating back to Dec. 24, 2020. He arrived at the woman’s apartment in the early morning hours after contacting her roommate through a social media hook-up site. Hawco had sex with the roommate and later entered the other woman’s room while she was passed out, pried her mouth open and started having oral sex with her before she woke up, frightened and confused. He then briefly left the room, came back with a condom and sexually assaulted her again. He then abruptly left the room, gathered his belongings and left the apartment, but forgot a toque. The woman went to police and Hawco was later charged with sexual assault. Crown counsel in the case argued Monday that Hawco should be sentenced to four years in prison, calling the assault “disgusting” and “very difficult to understand to people who are decent”. He also argued that the accused is dangerous and a risk to reoffend because he continues to deny the sexual assault. The victim, who cannot be named due to a publication ban, spoke out in frustration from the gallery when the case was delayed because of problems with her victim impact statement. She told the judge she could sign and date the document “right now.\" That was overruled by the judge. The woman could be heard crying as Hawco’s lawyer rose to make his case for a sentence of one year in jail and two years probation. He accused the prosecutor of as coming across as an advocate for the victim, and pointed out that his client has no prior criminal record. The Crown said the normal range of sentences for sexual assault is two to six years. The case has been adjourned to Monday, June 3, 2024 to fix a date for continuation. Last month, Hawco applied to have a judge declare a mistrial in his case and have the jury's conviction thrown out entirely. In his application, he pointed to the Crown's failure to completely disclose a statement the victim made to police. Of the 83-page statement, five pages were blacked out. Hawco's defence counsel successfully applied to access the redacted portions of the statement post-conviction in January, and after reading the full statement, the defence argued he would have proceeded differently if he'd had it prior to trial. While Justice Gary Weatherill said Hawco's arguments were “weighty and persuasive,” a judge has limited power to overturn a jury's verdict. He said this can only occur “in exceptional cases and where exceptional circumstances exist.” “Having reviewed the Redacted Portions, and although possibly relevant to the defence, on balance I am not persuaded that they reached the level of materiality that would warrant a mistrial being ordered,” Justice Weatherill said in the ruling. “Further, it must be kept in mind that this was a sexual assault case. [The victim] has already been through one trial and I have no doubt she has no interest in testifying again at a new trial.

        "content": "According to him, he was very sad to see Pochettino leave because he did a great job, and he can only wish him goodluck for the future. Eden added he expects Chelsea to go for De Zerbi soonest, even if he would suggest Fabregas as well. His words, “I was a bit sad, to be fair. I think that he did a great job. I know that people want Chelsea to be in the top four but it’s just a season of transition. He’s a great manager, I wish him good luck and let’s see who is going to be there in the future.” WOW. Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London. Founded in 1905, they play their home games at Stamford Bridge. The club competes in the Premier League, the top division of English football. They won their first major honour, the League championship, in 1955. The club won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners’ Cup, in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. On 7 May 2022, Chelsea confirmed that terms have been agreed for a new ownership group, led by Todd Boehly, Clearlake Capital, Mark Walter and Hansjörg Wyss, to acquire the club. The group was later known as BlueCo. The UK government approved the £4.25bn takeover, ending Abramovich’s 19-year ownership of the club. Bruce Buck, who served as chairman since 2003, was replaced by Boehly, while long-serving club director and de facto sporting director Marina Granovskaia left, as did Petr Čech from the role of technical and performance advisor.

        "content": "The Tennessee Vols are reportedly the \"team to beat\" for a 2025 four-star defensive lineman that the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs are also targeting. 2025 three-star defensive lineman Charles House told On3 this week that Tennessee is leading the way in his recruitment ahead of his commitment announcement later next next month. \"They make me feel very important and Tennessee is the team to beat for me,\" said House. The four-star recruit also told On3 that he has a \"great feeling\" about the Vols and the way he feels when he's on campus in Knoxville is what gives Tennessee the \"edge\" in his recruitment. House, 6-foot-3/300 lbs from Charlotte, NC, is rated by On3 as the No. 23 defensive lineman in the nation and the No. 9 player in the state of North Carolina. The coveted recruit will take an official visit to Alabama on May 31 before taking an official visit to Georgia on June 7. House's official visit to Tennessee is set for June 14. According to On3, House will choose between Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee on June 22. It sounds like Tennessee is sitting in a good spot for House, but the Vols will have to survive his official visits to Alabama and Georgia before they can breathe easy in this recruiting battle.

        "content": "The West London club parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino last week after an underwhelming season at Stamford Bridge, while they also disagreed on how the Premier League club should move going forward. That has led to many names being linked to the manager’s role at Chelsea over the last week but it seems that the Blues’ hierarchy have settled on Maresca. According to , Leicester have given the London outfit permission to speak to their manager as the Premier League giants made an official approach to the Foxes on Monday. The 44-year-old is set to be offered a contract spanning a minimum of five years having guided Leicester City to Championship glory this season. A big attraction for Chelsea will be the fact that Maresca has worked under Pep Guardiola, who many consider the greatest football coach of all time. Enzo Maresca is a big risk for Chelsea Maresca has had a very successful season with Leicester City but Chelsea appointing the 44-year-old as their new coach is a big risk. The Italian is yet to manage at the highest level of the sport and many will feel that the job at the Premier League giants is coming too soon. The London club have gone through a lot of managers since their takeover in 2022 and fans of the club will have very little confidence that they have got this appointment right. Next season should be very interesting for Chelsea as a fairly inexperienced manager will have to find a way to get a young squad to gel together.",

During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the London Palladium, the Geordie duo welcomed viewers back for the semi-finals of the talent competition. This marked the first show the doting dad has filmed since the arrival of his son Wilder on May 14. It didn’t take long before his supportive co-stars congratulated the 48-year-old on becoming a father for the first time on the show. Turning to head judge for some words of wisdom, the music mogul showered him with praise. He gushed: “By the way, can I just say congratulations to you, Ant? Truly, I really am happy for you.” It was at this point that the audience erupted into applause as they cheered his celebration on the show. Ant chuckled: “Thank you, I know you are. And thank you for you lovely gift.” He cheekily added: “Judges, I’m still waiting on yours” as the panel nervously shifted in their seats. Simon attempted to save the conversation by noting: “It was from all of us” as Ant added: “Okay, yeah but it was signed by you, not them” as his co-star Declan chuckled beside him. It comes after the new dad reportedly asked Dec, also 48, to be a godfather to his son. A source told OK!: \"Dec is obviously so excited for Ant and has already been giving him advice - mainly how to deal with sleepless nights. He can't wait to take on the role of godfather and he's promised to take his duties very seriously.\" The insider revealed that Ant, who was previously married to makeup artist Lisa Armstrong, had \"always\" intended to make Dec godfather to any biological children he might have. In a touching tribute to their friendship, Dec's son, Jack even has Anthony as a middle name. Dec, who referred to Ant as the \"best friend a man could have\" in his best man's speech at Ant's 2021 wedding to Anne-Marie, is a father of two with his wife Ali Astall. They have a four-year-old daughter named Isla and a son, Jack, who will be two in July. An insider revealed that Dec's children are delighted to have a new playmate in the McPartlin-Donnelly clan, and the parents are already planning joint summer holidays to their neighbouring holiday homes in Portugal. \"Wilder will practically be like a nephew to Dec, and he and Ant are excited for their boys to grow up together as there's less than two years between Wilder and Dec's son Jack - they want them to become as close as they are,\" the source added. \"Also, Dec's little girl Isla loves babies and is very pleased there is another baby around. They're planning lots of playdates and family holidays they're all hoping to spend most of the summer in Portugal as they always do and are all excited for Wilder's first holiday. Dec has also joked that Ant and Anne-Marie won't need to spend a fortune on clothes, as they can have all of Jack's hand-me-downs!\"",

The sides will meet in Kilkenny’s Nowlan Park on Saturday evening at 7.15pm with tickets going on sale earlier this afternoon. However, the Faithful County has released a statement saying that the fixture is sold out due to an “unprecedented demand” which has placed “immense pressure on the ticketing system.” Offaly Express reports that a Ticketmaster spokesperson confirmed that the game was sold out and that there is “absolutely with the site.” The Offaly GAA statement reads: “Due to the unprecedented demand for tickets for the under-20 All-Ireland match, we wish to inform you that all tickets are sold out. The high demand put immense pressure on the ticketing system, causing issues for supporters. This situation was beyond our control. “Nowlan Park was selected as the match venue several months ago. This Kilkenny City venue is hosting this year’s All-Ireland under-20 hurling final to commemorate the 100th anniversary of James Nowlan’s death. Kilkenny’s home ground and the under-20 cup have both been named in his honour since 2016, making this centenary year particularly significant. “We hope that additional tickets may become available in the coming days. We will keep supporters updated on any new developments. “We sincerely thank all the Faithful for their huge support.”",

The HGV blaze, on the northbound side of the M1 at Junction 4 Donabate in Dublin, started before 4pm this afternoon.

A large amount of waste spread out onto the carriageway, with a teleporter and prime mover also sent out to the scene to aid with cleanup. Dublin Fire Brigade posted on X: \"The M1 is currently closed as we deal with a HGV fire on the motorway. \"We're making good progress but traffic delays are building.\" It later added: \"Firefighting operations are continuing. \"A foam tender and water tanker are now on scene. \"A large amount of waste is on the carriageway. \"We're using a teleporter and prime mover to help clear the scene.\" Another post read: \"Our Manitou teleporter has been used to good effect to remove the burning waste so it can be extinguished and cooled.\" Dramatic pictures posted on the account showed smoke billowing over the motorway, while several vehicles and firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze and move the waste and truck. TII Traffic said the vehicle fire was causing \"heavy traffic\". It added: \"Expect delays and drive carefully.\" Meanwhile, last week the DFB issued an urgent warning ahead of heat hitting Ireland in warmer months. They alerted the public of the fire hazard associated with reflections. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Dublin Fire Brigade warned that reflections from mirrors and glass onto flammable surfaces can cause fires. They warned: \"Just a gentle reminder to remove mirrors, glasses, and vases from window ledges or anywhere they might be exposed to direct sunlight. \"They can cause fires if the sun is reflected onto a flammable surface.\" Where you have a mirror or any other glass object, such as an ornament, that is curved, this allows the glass to act as a lens. When the sunlight hits it, it becomes concentrated and, if the rays are bounced onto something flammable - like curtains or soft furnishings - then a fire can start.",

        "content": "We wrap up the first round of the women’s singles on Day 3 of the French Open. 20 matches are scheduled, and–as always–we here at LastWordOnTennis will share our thoughts on all of them with you. We split the day’s matches between five articles. In addition to this one, the other four feature Elena Rybakina vs Greet Minnen , Qinwen Zheng vs Alize Cornet , Madison Keys vs Renata Zarazua , and Aryna Sabalenka vs Erika Andreeva . Predicting these matches are Jordan Reynolds, Manuel Traquete, and Liam McBride. French Open Day 3 Predictions Jordan: Teenage prodigy Andreeva is capable of making a deep run at the French Open, even at such an early stage of her career. This is a good first round draw for her. Bektas is a feisty competitor but she does not possess anything close to the level of natural talent that Andreeva has. Prediction: Andreeva in 3 Manuel: Andreeva is perhaps the WTA’s most exciting prospect and she got a very kind opening round draw here. The 17-year-old star should be able to make quick work of Bektas and perhaps start a real run here. Prediction: Andreeva in 2 Liam: Andreeva has been somewhat of a feel-good story in the past year. At just seventeen years old she has already broken into the Top 40 and seems destined for a career at the top. She will come up against an opponent who is solid in all areas, although lacks a distinctive weapon. Bektas has been around the block long enough to make this a tough one, Andreeva will push through though. Prediction: Andreeva in 3 Jordan: Stearns has momentum after winning the title in Rabat heading into this event. That spells danger for Bagaric, since Stearns is very dangerous when her powerful game is firing on all cylinders. The American is likely to feed off the adrenaline of her title and not allow herself to have any kind of dip. Prediction: Stearns in 2 Manuel: Both players should be riding high on confidence, with Ciric having an excellent run through qualifying to make the main draw and Stearns winning the title in Rabat last week. The latter is the better player in general and should have a slight edge here. Prediction: Stearns in 3 Liam: It’s Bagaric’s first Grand Slam and the 20-year-old holds a lot of promise. In her first match, she would’ve been wishing for an easier opponent though. The American will be sky-high in confidence after winning the WTA 250 Rabat at a stroll, beating Mayar Sherif 6-2 6-1. Bagaric will be competitive as she possesses an awkward game to play at times, heavy with slices and angles. However, Stearns will overcome this with her consistent depth and dominance on her forehand. Prediction: Stearns in 2 Jordan: There will be many long rallies in this match. Frech will need to play more aggressively than usual to have a chance, since Kasatkina is one of the best movers in the women’s game, especially on clay. The Russian’s consistency and athleticism will be very hard for Frech to get through in the opening round. Prediction: Kasatkina in 2 Manuel: Both players have been playing well in this clay season, but Kasatkina is generally the higher level player. It should be a tight match, but Kasatkina should be able to pull through in the end. Prediction: Kasatkina in 3 Liam: Kasatkina’s counter-punching style suits the clay so well. However, since a runner-up medal in Charleston, she has failed to find her feet this clay court season. Frech is a tricky opponent with an unorthodox but very effective backhand which can throw off many opponents. Frech has also endured a torrid clay court season including a 6-0 6-2 loss to Sloane Stephens. Don’t expect this to be a classic, however it’ll be gritty and fascinating. I am going with Frech to cause an upset. Prediction: Frech in 3 Jordan: Clay-court specialist Podoroska’s best chance of beating Azarenka is definitely on the dirt. But it is still unlikely. Despite Azarenka’s results on the surface declining somewhat in recent years, her overall game is still more formidable than the Argentine on any surface. The sets will probably be competitive though. Prediction: Azarenka in 2 Manuel: Azarenka is very far from her Slam-winning, World #1 days, but she has settled as a solid Top 20 player who can always be a threat at any given event. She is still playing at a very high level and should be able to make quick work of this opening round. Prediction: Azarenka in 2 Liam: You’d be silly to write off Podoroska who has history at Roland Garros having made the semi-final in 2020. However, that was in remarkably different conditions with colder Autumn conditions, meaning a lower bouncing ball traveling slightly slower through the air. In the warm weather forecasted Azarenka’s big-hitting style will thrive. She won’t find it easy but she’ll book a place in the second round. Prediction: Azarenka in 3 This article first appeared on Last Word On Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "The lawsuit alleges that James is using the \"State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers.\"",
        "content": "was hit with another lawsuit this week by an anti-abortion group relating to abortion pill reversal protocol. Last week, the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates, Gianna's House, Inc., and Choose Life of Jamestown, Inc., filed a lawsuit against James, alleging that she is using \"the State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers and a network of affiliated centers from providing the information\" regarding Abortion Pill Reversal. An APR procedure involves a woman who has changed their mind about aborting a pregnancy after taking mifepristone, a drug that is used to end a pregnancy. APR involves taking progesterone to offset the effects of mifepristone. The lawsuit states that a woman identified as Maranda recently welcomed her daughter into the world after an APR. According to the lawsuit, Maranda was taking mifepristone but later changed her mind about her pregnancy and received information from \"New Hope Family Services' website about a method of using FDA-approved progesterone supplements, which physicians may lawfully prescribe under New York law, in an effort to save a developing child by counteracting the hormone-blocking effects of mifepristone.\" \"The Attorney General alleges that New Hope and the other pro-life pregnancy centers are spreading 'false and misleading' information about progesterone treatment. She seeks an injunction and other penalties to censor their attempts to provide this information,\" the lawsuit says. \"This action seeks to enjoin the Attorney General from targeting, chilling, and punishing Plaintiffs' speech about progesterone treatment, and to declare that her actions violate Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to speak freely, to practice their religion, and to due process under the law.\" reached out to James's office and the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates via email for comment. Earlier this month, James was by a coalition of anti-abortion groups that said she sought to block Christian pregnancy centers from promoting so-called abortion pill reversal protocol. The Abortion Pill Rescue Network says that studies of APR have shown it has a 64-68 percent success rate of allowing the pregnancy to continue, but the course of action has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( ). Jor-El Godsey, President of Heartbeat International, one of several anti-abortion groups named as plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement that \"New York State laws protect abortionists and abortion on demand up until birth. Now they are targeting those who assist a woman in exercising her right to continue her own pregnancy.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Messier 78 is a nursery of star formation enveloped in a shroud of interstellar dust located 1,300 light-years away from Earth. Using its infrared camera, Euclid exposed hidden regions of star formation for the first time and mapped complex filaments of gas and dust in unprecedented detail. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Euclid, an ESA mission with NASA ’s support, aims to map the sky and study dark matter and dark energy. Its new images and data reveal significant scientific findings, including free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, enhancing our understanding of the universe. The Euclid mission has released five new images that showcase the space telescope’s ability to explore two large-scale cosmic mysteries: dark matter and dark energy . Dark matter is an invisible substance five times more common in the universe than “regular” matter but with an unknown composition. “Dark energy” is the name given to the unknown source causing the universe to expand faster and faster. The Euclid mission is led by ESA (the European Space Agency) with contributions from NASA , Cosmic Mapping and Precision By 2030, Euclid will create a cosmic map that covers almost a third of the sky, using a field of view that is far wider than NASA’s Hubble and James Webb space telescopes, which are designed to study smaller areas in finer detail. Scientists will then chart the presence of dark matter with higher precision than ever before. They can also use this map to study how dark energy’s strength has changed over time. Galaxy cluster Abell 2764 (top right), imaged by ESA’s Euclid telescope, contains hundreds of galaxies. The area outside the cluster also contains distant galaxies that appear as they did when the universe was only 700 million years old. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License The five new images feature views of varying sizes — from a star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy to clusters of hundreds of galaxies — and were taken shortly after Euclid’s launch in July 2023 as part of its early release observations program. The mission released five images from that program last year as a preview of what Euclid would offer, before scientists had analyzed the data. New Images and Research Availability The new images, related science papers, and data are available on the Euclid website . A pre-recorded program by ESA about these findings is available on ESA TV and YouTube . Mission planners with NASA’s forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will use Euclid’s findings to inform Roman’s complementary dark energy work. Scientists will use Roman, with its better sensitivity and sharpness, to extend the kind of science Euclid enables by studying fainter and more distant galaxies. Euclid’s view of the Dorado group of galaxies shows signs of galaxies interacting and merging. The shells of hazy white and yellow material, as well as curving “tails” extending into space, are evidence of gravitational interaction between the galaxies. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Curved Space and Gravitational Lensing One way Euclid will help scientists study dark matter is by observing how this mysterious phenomenon warps the light from distant galaxies, as seen in one of the new images featuring a cluster of galaxies called Abell 2390. The mass of the galaxy cluster, which includes dark matter, creates curves in space. Light from more distant galaxies traveling over those curves appears to bend or arc, similar to how light looks when passing through the warped glass of an old window. Sometimes the warping is so powerful it can create rings, pronounced arcs, or multiple images of the same galaxy — a phenomenon called strong gravitational lensing . Scientists interested in exploring the effects of dark energy will primarily look for a subtler effect, called weak gravitational lensing, which requires detailed computer analysis to detect and reveals the presence of even smaller clumps of dark matter. By mapping that dark matter and tracing how these clumps evolve over time, scientists will investigate how the outward acceleration of dark energy has changed dark matter’s distribution. More than 50,000 galaxies are visible in this image of Abell 2390, a galaxy cluster 2.7 billion light-years away from Earth. Near the center of the image, some of the galaxies appear smudged and curved, an effect called strong gravitational lensing that can be used to detect dark matter. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Instruments and Observational Capabilities “Because dark energy is a relatively weak effect, we need larger surveys to give us more data and better statistical precision,” said Mike Seiffert, the NASA project scientist for Euclid at the agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “It’s not something where we can zoom in on one galaxy and study it in detail. We need to look at a much bigger area but still be able to detect these subtle effects. To make that happen, we needed a specialized space telescope like Euclid.” The telescope uses two instruments that detect different wavelengths of light: the visible-light imager (VIS) and the near-infrared spectrometer and photometer (NISP). Foreground galaxies emit more light in visible wavelengths (those the human eye can perceive), while background galaxies are typically brighter in infrared wavelengths. “Observing a galaxy cluster with both instruments allows us to see galaxies at a wider range of distances than what we could get using either visible or infrared alone,” said JPL ’s Jason Rhodes, principal investigator for NASA’s Euclid dark energy science team. “And Euclid can make these types of deep, wide, high-resolution images hundreds of times faster than other telescopes.” Euclid’s large field of view captures the entirety of galaxy NGC 6744 and shows astronomers key areas of star formation. Forming stars is the main way by which galaxies grow and evolve, so these investigations are central to understanding why galaxies look the way they do. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi; CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO or ESA Standard License Discoveries Beyond Dark Energy While dark matter and dark energy are central to the Euclid. The mission has a variety of other astronomical applications. Euclid’s large-area sky map can, for instance, be used to discover faint objects and observe changes in cosmic objects, like a star changing in brightness. Euclid’s new science results include the detection of free-floating planets (planets that don’t orbit stars), which are difficult to find because of their faintness. In addition, the data reveals newly discovered brown dwarfs. Thought to form like stars but not quite large enough to begin fusion in their cores, these objects highlight the differences between stars and planets. “The data, images, and scientific papers coming out now mark the very beginning of Euclid’s scientific results, and they show a startlingly wide variety of science beyond the primary objective of the mission,” said Seiffert. “What we’re already seeing from Euclid’s wide view has produced results that study individual planets, features in our home Milky Way galaxy, and the structure of the universe at large scales. It’s both thrilling and a little overwhelming to keep up with all the developments.” Euclid Contributions and Support Three NASA-supported science teams contribute to the Euclid mission. In addition to designing and fabricating the sensor-chip electronics for Euclid’s Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument, JPL led the procurement and delivery of the NISP detectors as well. Those detectors, along with the sensor chip electronics, were tested at NASA’s Detector Characterization Lab at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Euclid NASA Science Center at IPAC (ENSCI), at Caltech in Pasadena, California, will archive the science data and support U.S.-based science investigations. JPL is a division of Caltech.",

        "content": "By NEIL HARTNELL Tribune Business Editor nhartnell@tribunemedia.net A Bahamian developer is aiming to unleash $1bn in new real estate within the next five to six years as it likened this nation’s high-end property market to Long Island’s upscale Hamptons community. Matthew Marco, marketing director and licensed realtor at Bond Bahamas, told Tribune Business it is “very bullish” on the country’s real estate prospects given that he had “never received more responses to an e-mail blast in my 20 years in real estate” than the recent launch of the final unsold 14 lots at Balmoral. Jason Kinsale, Bond Bahamas president, was Balmoral’s original developer through his Aristo Development firm, which is affiliated with the realtor. Mr Marco revealed that they plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in not just completing the Aqualina development at Cable Beach but other upcoming projects at Love Beach and Goodman’s Bay. He disclosed to this newspaper that some $250m will be invested in constructing Amaya, a Love Beach development featuring 40 residences priced between $4m and $12m, which is likely to launch towards the end of 2024 and target residents from high-end New Providence communities such as Lyford Cay and Old Fort Bay who are seeking to downsize. And Mr Marco also confirmed that Mr Kinsale has acquired the Fairview property at Goodman’s Bay - a deal first revealed by Tribune Business last year. The property is currently being “land banked” with its value expected to appreciate further as a result of a GoldWynn penthouses project that is viewed as driving real estate values in the area even higher. “We’re very bullish. We have about $1bn in inventory from our projects over the next five to six years,” he told Tribune Business. “Between Love Beach, Goodman’s Bay and Cable Beach, there’s a lot of good things happening. There’s just no more land left in New Providence. “We wouldn’t be doing this if we didn’t believe in the market and what is happening here. We see The Bahamas booming for the foreseeable future, no question, and are putting our money where our mouth is.... We’re becoming the Hamptons of south Florida. “People want waterfront, canalfront properties which are $100m in south Florida. Here we are one-third of that price. We’re still trading at a discount. The average person does not realise there’s still a lot of upside value here and it’s a nice place to live.” Mr Marco said “in excess of $100m” has been invested in Balmoral’s build-out since the community’s development began in 2008, with some $250m set to be spent on both Amaya and Aqualina. The number of construction jobs these projects will create has yet to be determined. “That will be about 40 residences with three to four bedrooms from $5m to $12m,” he confirmed of Amaya. “That’s going to sell-out in a matter of weeks when we launch it at the end of this year. We’re in design mode right now. That will be targeted at Lyford Cay and Old Fort Bay families looking to downsize, and want the reduced maintenance of a condo, but still want to be out west; they don’t want to be in Cable Beach”. No name or design has been agreed for the Fairview acquisition, Mr Marco said, adding: “Right now we’re land banking it. It’s something that was bought, but the value is only increasing because GoldWynn has done such an amazing job with their project.” As for Balmoral, he explained that the Government’s unveiling of its proposed $290m new hospital at Perpall Tract had acted as “the catalyst” to place the remaining 14 lots at the Sanford Drive gated community on the market. The lots, 11 single family and three multi-family, are carrying gross price points between $223,371 and $392,790. “We held it for a while,” Mr Marco said of the 43-acre community’s final lot inventory. “There was so much demand when we started 15 years ago. There’s going to be a catalyst. The catalyst is the new hospital. We know that when that goes under construction we will see massive interest in Balmoral. “We held tight, and now we’re going to market them. That [the hospital] was a big catalyst. If you have speculators out there looking for investment property there’s nothing better than having senior doctors working at a hospital and looking for a nice place nearby to rent. There’s no better community than Balmoral.” Asked about the market’s response to the marketing launch for the 14 lots, Mr Marco replied: “I’ve never received more responses to an email blast in my 20-year history in real estate. I certainly wasn’t expecting it. I knew I’d get interest but I wasn’t expecting it. We’re even considering building spec homes and renting them out. The inventory is non-existent and people want it.” He argued that Balmoral compared favourably to similarly priced communities such as Sandyport and Charlotteville, and efforts to dispose of the remaining 14 lots will benefit from their location in an established gated community that has an existing homeowners association, amenities and is located close to developments such as Baha Mar, GoldWynn and Cable Beach. Besides residential real estate, Mr Marco said he and Mr Kinsale have also ventured into the commercial market. “Jason and myself, we bought two years ago a 100 year-old home on the corner of Prospect Ridge and Sanford Drive,” he added. “It’s now the Skyline Corporate Centre and we’re getting a lot of interest in that. We launched it for rentals just recently and have been showing it a lot. We’ve been showing it to law firms, banks and for government offices. A couple of ministries have looked at it. There’s a shortage on the island of brand new office space.” Revealing that Skyline Corporate Centre represents a $10m investment, Mr Marco said it features four buildings and 15,000 square feet with a rental price of $75 per square foot. Prospective tenants have looked at the possibility of renting all four.",

        "content": "The Sacramento Police Department closed off downtown streets to traffic Monday morning after a community Memorial Day event was disrupted by about 50 pro-Palestine demonstrators, police said. Police closed off J and 15th streets around 10:53 a.m. along the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium. This turned into rolling road closures in the vicinity as people began marching through the streets, police said. The roadway was fully reopened by 1:30 p.m. There were no arrests made or reported assaults, police said. Mayor Darrell Steinberg was attending the event at Memorial Auditorium when it was disrupted. “Freedom of speech does not mean shouting over others and preventing them from exercising their right to speak,\" the mayor said in a statement shared with KCRA 3. \"This is one of the great challenges and problems in our modern culture. Those who died to protect our freedoms would expect that with freedom comes the responsibility to care for others, to respect the rule of law, to learn how to fight for what we believe in with respect and civility, and to never take for granted the sacrifices made by so many.” The demonstration is beginning to march. Rolling closures will be occurring in the immediate area. Please continue to seek alternative routes. https://t.co/63vrj9Zpzr See our live traffic map for updates.

        "description": "A former student has requested a formal inquiry into the actions of Pinky Green.",
        "content": "By Natalie Akoorie of RNZ Warning: may have disturbing content A Tauranga Boys’ College teacher who resigned citing ill health after he was accused of propositioning a student in 1988 was the subject of multiple complaints, with some dating as far back as the early 1960s. The former student whose complaint ended the teacher’s career now wants an independent inquiry to establish the school’s conduct in the scandal. But the school says a historical abuse cases specialist reviewed the 1988 investigation and described it as “exemplary”. The former board of trustees chairperson said they achieved the best outcome possible in the circumstances. Details of more complaints have come to light in a report by the retired police sergeant who investigated in 1988 and found at least six complaints spanning the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Original complainant Glenn Marshall said the report proved more could have been done to hold English teacher Pinky Green to account. Instead the teacher - who died more than two years ago - resigned with his pension and reputation intact. Marshall accused the prestigious all-boys school in early 2022 of sweeping Green’s conduct under the carpet. The board of trustees issued a public apology for Green’s advances on students during the three decades he taught at the college. After the apology the school was contacted by several other victims, one of whom came forward publicly earlier this year claiming he was sexually abused by Green. Marshall, now 53, said he believed the 1988 investigation by retired sergeant Russell Christie showed the school could have done more. “They didn’t go looking for those other victims to find out exactly what happened. Instead they exited Green as quietly as possible.” What the Christie report found Marshall was 17 and in the 7th form (Year 13) in February 1988 when he was lured by Green to the school library after hours. There - with the blinds drawn and the lights off - Green asked the boy if he would agree to be paid up to $20 per session to perform bondage on the teacher. After Marshall’s mother and another parent complained, the school hired Christie. He interviewed two former college principals who reported a series of complaints from the early 1960s, including that Green took a group of Year 9 students on a picnic after school, prompting complaints from parents. Former principal Garth Sim, who died in 2017, spoke “severely” to Green and banned him from taking students away from school unless accompanied by another staff member or parent. It did not stop Green taking a boy home one lunch time in about 1963 where he propositioned the student, and later admitted caning the boy six times. He was threatened with dismissal, but apologised instead. Former principal Norman Morris told of a 1978 student who wanted to leave school to get away from Green, by then in charge of the library. The boy’s father inferred something had occurred between the boy - a librarian - and Green to provoke the reaction, and said if his son continued at the college Green was not to have any contact with his son. Morris, who died in 2021, believed Green to be a sadist, the report said. Christie also spoke to a Year 13 student who transferred to Ōtūmoetai College in 1988 because of Green, but the statement has not been released. Another former student told Christie a friend complained to him in 1987 that if he wanted promotion in the Tauranga Boys’ College library he’d have to physically beat his teacher, Green. Christie, who died in 2004, listed the names of three other students, which are redacted. Two students he spoke to admitted Green had approached them individually to participate in “experiments”. “Although never stated by anyone I have spoken to, it is quite clear that there are sexual overtones of an unsavoury nature in these approaches by Mr Green to these students and there is an obvious degree of either sadism or masochism, or both, and I believe that urgent action should be taken to resolve Mr Green’s future at an early date,” Christie wrote. He said he had no doubt Green’s conduct was “extremely unprofessional” and in his opinion, in breach of the Education Act 1964. What Tauranga Boys’ College knew The Christie report was unearthed in June last year, but Marshall did not know about it until April. He was never told about the other complaints, or that Christie considered him so affected by the proposition that he appeared “to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown”. “Mr Green is persisting in his attempt to have Glenn Marshall attend or meet him at the library and Marshall has become extremely emotionally upset over this matter, and it is apparent that some immediate steps must be taken to resolve this complaint and remove the obvious pressure from the boys,” Christie wrote. Marshall called for an independent inquiry to discover the full extent of the school’s role in enabling Green’s conduct to continue, and why Green was not sacked in 1988. “The school had several previous serious red flags brought to its attention regarding Green’s conduct, with the 1988 Christie report revealing that the two previous principals were aware of serious misconduct by Green against students dating back to the 1960s,” Marshall said. “Had he been dismissed, all these other students that we now know of what went on, none of those students had to be put through this.” The 1988 board chairperson hits back Former board of trustees chairperson Bill Holland said the board achieved the best outcome it could. “They were different times then. Sacking a teacher was not easy in those days. It’s by no means a straight-forward matter ... He [Green] had the backing of the PPTA.” Green had a lawyer and Holland said the teacher never admitted liability. Holland, a former lawyer himself, said if the school had persisted with a disciplinary process the students involved would have been put through a cross-examination process, and their anonymity would have been lost. “There was by no means certainty as to the outcome.” He and former principal Graham Young met with the parents of four students, including Marshall’s, and Holland said it was agreed to deal with Green in a way that protected the boys. “I thought that what happened to the boys was terrible. I was 100 per cent behind them. The process to try and look after the boys was the best outcome possible managed in consultation with their parents.” What the school says Tauranga Boys’ College principal Andrew Turner disagreed that the Christie report showed the school did not properly handle the 1988 complaint. “The new board initiated an independent review of the 1988 Christie report by a specialist in historical abuse cases which described the 1988 investigation as ‘exemplary’.” Turner said the school believed the process was handled properly in 1988 and because they had already undertaken a review the board would not conduct a further investigation. Asked whether he was disappointed more wasn’t done earlier to protect students from Green, Turner said matters like this were disappointing. “We believe the school did all it could to ensure students were safe once the concern was raised at the time.” Turner, who became the school’s principal in July 2022, said the new board had used the situation to review its policies and processes to ensure students and staff were kept safe.

        "description": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske.",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” THE AGONY OF DEFEAT As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” ___ AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing Jenna Fryer, The Associated Press",

        "content": "A 30-year-old Captain America sign from the original Bosco's stands in the property purchased by store owner John Weddleton in 2014. Weddleton plans to move his business to the new location early next year. (Bill Roth / ADN) As Alaska’s financial outlook headed south in the mid-1980s, so did John Weddleton. Unable to find work as an economist during the recession, he moved from Fairbanks to Anchorage in 1987 to work at Randy Ramuglia’s tiny comics store located in a shoe repair shop until he could find something else in his field. Although the store — Bosco’s — has called multiple locations home along Spenard Road, Weddleton never left. In the succeeding 37 years, Bosco’s has evolved into a vital resource for customers and a hub for activity in the world of comics, cards, collectibles and games. The store, which celebrates its 40th anniversary this month, is an unequivocal Anchorage success story, notable for both its longevity and prosperity. With a store in Dimond Center and a vastly larger Spenard headquarters, Weddleton, who is now the sole owner, employs around 30 people. John Weddleton, owner of Bosco's Comics Cards & Games, photographed at his store in Spenard on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. (Bill Roth / ADN) But despite the tens of thousands of pieces of memorabilia and merchandise that line the walls and aisles at the Spenard store, Weddleton maintains Bosco’s is chiefly in the people business. “Our motto in the store is listen to our customers,” he said. “We get what they want, sell it and repeat. You’ve got to listen your customers and when they start asking for stuff, you better make note.” That approach has served the store well in the realm of games and collectibles, where trends can ignite at the snap of a finger but also burn out just as quickly. When Magic the Gathering and Pokemon started gained popularity, Bosco’s was listening. “Having staff that people can talk to comfortably about what they’re passionate about,” store manager Eric Helmick said. “Being a communal focal point for those people to talk about their different nerd fandoms. We’re here on the frontlines when those people ask about stuff.” With an immensity of individual items packed from wall to wall, the store can be overwhelming to navigate without a roadmap. What started as a comic store quickly adopted sports cards. And as the trends and preferences changed so did the store, adding board games, anime, table top games like Dungeons and Dragons, graphic novels, Manga and more.

(Bill Roth / ADN) But with so many options, there is still a connective tissue that ties together customers of different stripes. “The through line is the passion,” said Bosco’s employee Vonnalet Mykham. “ You might not understand anything about Magic, but you can relate to it in a way that someone can relate to loving comic books.” It was a love for comic books that brought Jordan Whitethorn and Glen Lopez to the store on Wednesday. Bosco’s is a place for them to explore, relate and debate. “There’s something that led everyone here if you’re a comics person, or a sports card person or board gamer or card gamer,” Whitethorn said. ”You get to talking to someone about the thing you like and maybe they give that a chance or you find a third thing you both like.” “It’s such a valuable place for any fandom to have to centralize and start an argument.” It’s a fandom that David Harper is deeply familiar with. Harper has a website SKTCHD as well as a podcast called “Off Panel” devoted to the world of comics. He worked at the store as a teenager and has been a customer for 35 of his 40 years. “It’s home for a lot of people who love very specialized things that they wouldn’t find otherwise,” Harper said. “You come in and you see a whole bunch of people who are excited about the same things as you are. ... It’s an essential part of Anchorage and Anchorage’s collective of nerds.” SOME STORIES ARE TOO BIG FOR JUST WORKS BOSCOS sign in front of Bosco's comic shop Spenard Road on Friday, June 13, 2014. (Bob Hallinen / ADN) Nerd culture has gained broader acceptance in recent years with the popularity of superhero movies and other franchises that have hit the mainstream. But that hasn’t always been the case. The original store had posters in the window, but when Bosco’s changed locations in 1987, Weddleton opted for clear windows and a brighter, more lively environment. But a customer appealed to Weddleton to put the posters back up, saying he didn’t want to be spotted shopping in the store. “This was ‘87, people were embarrassed to be comic readers and now, not at all,” he said. With acceptance has come increasing quality. “ Line of Sight ,” a current exhibition at the Anchorage Museum, features the art of Alaska comic illustrators David Brame, Dimi Macheras and Nathan Shafer. “It’s incredible to think back 40 years that this museum connected with the Smithsonian has this major display on our local comic creators,” Weddleton said. A big part of the store’s success, Weddleton said, is its willingness to engage with its customers. Sometimes that means playing along. “The Death of Superman” in 1992 was a landmark moment in the comics industry and piqued the interest of readers, collectors and even the general public. The store organized a memorial for Superman at Dimond Center with Weddleton performing a eulogy of sorts for the fallen superhero. The event was complete with plants in the audience, who gave impassioned testimonials to his great deeds. “He saved my baby,” Weddleton emoted, repeating a line from an actor in the crowd. The store has also joined outraged customers in protesting the cancellation of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” which had a very popular accompanying comic. They’ve even petitioned the municipality to change the name of Anchorage road Lois Drive to Lois Lane, after Superman’s love interest. “It’s really important,” Weddleton said. “For one, it makes it more fun to do this crazy stuff. I mean, how many businesses can you do something like that?” The store has also engrained itself into Anchorage’s collective consciousness with well-known ads, touting the claim that “not just comics, Bosco’s has it all.” Many of the Bosco’s employees have been with the store for decades, developing connections and institutional knowledge. Helmick started working at the store in 1992 when he was still in college and Mykham has been there since before Bosco’s moved into its current location in 1995. John Weddleton, owner of Bosco's Comics Cards & Games, photographed at his store in Spenard on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. (Bill Roth / ADN) “I’m seeing people that I used to sell comics 20 years ago, they’re coming in with kids,” Helmick said. Weddleton credits his staff for much of the evolution of the store done over the years. “We reinvent ourselves constantly,” Weddleton said. “If they have an idea to do something my answer is, ‘Let me know how it goes. Let me know what you need from me.’ They’re smart. If you don’t try things, then you don’t innovate. You get stale.” Part of that innovation an expanded events room that allows the store to host swap meets and game competitions. “It’s fun for us to host events,” Weddleton said. “Our staff and I are gamers and collectors and so these are our people. And for a lot of our customers it’s a big part of their life to come here, meet with their friends and play this game. To offer that to people is really amazing. It’s so cool.”",

I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. “Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” ___ AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "Prajwal Revanna released a video in which he alleged political conspiracy behind the case (File) After Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, accused in the alleged obscene case, alleged conspiracy against him, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said on Monday that he was free to say anything but is bound to face the law. \"Prajwal Revanna may say whatever he wants, but eventually he will have to face the law once he lands,\" DK Shivakumar told reporters at the KPCC office in Bengaluru on Monday. On asked about Prajwal Revanna's allegation that the alleged case against him was a conspiracy of the Congress party, DK Shivakumar said, \"I don't have much information on Prajwal Revanna's video, but I came across it through the media. No matter what he says, he doesn't have a choice but to present himself before the SIT for investigation. The law will take its course in this case.\" \"Rahul Gandhi has spoken about Prajwal based on media reports, there is nothing wrong with it. Time will answer Prajwal's allegation on Rahul Gandhi,\" he added. Prajwal Revanna, earlier in the day, released a self-made video in which he alleged political conspiracy behind the case and said that he will appear before the SIT on May 31. The Hassan MP also claimed that he \"went into depression\" and \"isolated\" himself as he accused Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders of sparking a discussion on the issue as part of an alleged conspiracy. Prajwal Revanna is facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT) constituted by the Karnataka government over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in his household. Prajwal Revanna's video comes days after his grandfather and JDS patron HD Deve Gowda, issued a stern warning to return to India from abroad and face the law in the obscene video case. \"I have already said that he should be given the harshest punishment under the law if found guilty. I also cannot convince people that I was unaware of Prajwal's activities. I cannot convince them that I have no desire to shield him. I cannot convince them that I am not aware of his movements and that I was not aware of his foreign trip. I believe in answering my conscience. I believe in God, and I know the almighty knows the truth,\" the former PM said in a post on X on May 23. \"I will ensure that there will be no interference in the enquiry against him from me or my family members,\" the former PM added. According to the sources, the Ministry of External Affairs of India has received a letter from the Karnataka government for the cancellation of the diplomatic passport in respect of MP Prajwal Revanna. The request is being processed. Siddaramaiah had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1 and May 23 urging him to take action to cancel the diplomatic passport of the Hassan MP, who is said to have flown to Europe after being accused of sexually exploiting several women. In his letter to the Prime Minister, Siddaramaiah said that it is shameful that Prajwal Revanna fled the country on April 27, 2024, to Germany using his diplomatic passport, shortly after news of his heinous actions emerged and just a few hours before the first FIR was filed against him. Speaking on the Karnataka government's request for cancellation of Prajwal Revanna's diplomatic passport, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) received a request only on May 21 to impound Prajwal Revanna's passport. In an exclusive interview with ANI, S Jaishankar clarified the procedural aspects, saying, \"To impound a passport is governed by an act called the Passport Act. We need a judicial court or a police request to do so. The MEA got this request from Karnataka only on May 21.\" Highlighting the adherence to legal procedures, S Jaishankar emphasised that the external affairs minister acted promptly upon receiving the request. \"We immediately acted on it. On 23rd of May... we have to follow a certain procedure and the procedure is initiated,\" he added. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com However, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said that they did not get any written communication from the MEA in this matter.

        "description": "Bombay High Court rules transit rent as non-taxable, no TDS deduction required for flat owner/tenant. Transit rent, a form of hardship allowance, is not a revenue receipt.",
        "content": "MUMBAI: In a landmark decision, Bombay HC has held that transit rent , which is paid by a developer to a flat owner/tenant on dispossession of the flat, is not a revenue receipt. It cannot be taxed in the hands of the recipient. Thus, the question of deduction of tax at source ( TDS ) by the developer from the amount payable to the flat owner/tenant does not arise, it said. On a writ filed by Sarfaraz S Furniturewalla, the issue before HC was whether there should be a deduction of TDS on the amount payable to him as transit rent by the builder. TOI has earlier covered orders passed by ITAT, which have held that transit rent is a 'capital receipt' and it is not a revenue stream of income. Thus, it is not taxable in the hands of the recipient. HC said transit rent, which is commonly referred to as hardship/rehabilitation/displacement allowance, is paid by the developer or landlord to a flat owner/tenant who suffers hardship due to dispossession of his/her house. Transit rent is not to be considered as a revenue receipt and is not liable to tax. Thus, there will be no question of deduction of tax from the amount paid by the developer. A tax expert attached to a developer company said the HC order provides clarity. It is beneficial not only to flat owners or tenants who receive transit fees but also developers.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. “I think the thing that affected me the most is just being able to sleep well,” Ohtani said through a translator on Monday before the Dodgers’ series opener at the New York Mets was rained out. “Now that I’ve been able to do that, I also came to realize that how I feel off the field mentally shouldn’t affect my abilities, and I have every confidence in my own ability that I could be able to still play without being affected by anything that happens off the field.” In the first season of a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers, Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. His 131 total bases topped the big leagues and he was third in OPS at 1.024 behind the Yankees’ Aaron Judge and Houston’s Kyle Tucker. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts revealed Saturday that Ohtani has been playing with a bruised left hamstring. Ohtani was hurt May 16 — his bobblehead night at Dodger Stadium — when struck by a pickoff attempt from Cincinnati left-hander Brent Suter with a 2-2 count to Freddie Freeman. Ohtani grabbed behind his left leg while bending, fell to his left knee, got up, patted his left leg and winced. Two pitches later he stole second. “It got worse the next day, and started to kind of feel it more and more as I ran more,” Ohtani said through his new translator, Will Ireton. “It’s getting better day by day. It’s definitely — today is a lot better than yesterday.” Ohtani, who turns 30 on July 5, showed signs of the hamstring injury when didn’t run at full speed on a triple at Cincinnati on Saturday. “Right off the bat, I knew it was going to be a pretty easy triple,” he said. “But just looking back in hindsight, just knowing that it was (Elly) De La Cruz, it became a little bit closer than I thought.” “Obviously, the legs — isn’t that great, but I don’t personally think it’s affecting the swing,” Ohtani added. He left a May 11 game at San Diego in the ninth inning because of back tightness and didn’t play the next day. “I feel pretty good with the back. I’ve been working out and making sure that’s in a good place,” he said. An unprecedented two-way player, Ohtani has a .279 average in seven big league seasons with 184 homers, 472 RBIs and 99 stolen bases while going 38-19 with a 3.01 ERA in 86 starts with 608 strikeouts in 481 2/3 innings. He’s not pitching this year after tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow for the second time last Aug. 23 while pitching for the Los Angeles Angels. He had surgery on Sept. 19 and expects to return to the mound next season. “A starting pitcher can tell you that there’s a little bit of nervousness going into a game, a game we start,” Ohtani said. ”So in a sense I do miss that, that kind of atmosphere. But right now I’m really just focused on just progressing every day.” He hasn’t concluded whether his offense has improved because he isn’t pitching. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “It’s hard to say at this point. I have to play through the season to see if I could really say that,” Ohtani explained. Ohtani said he threw at 80 mph from 60 feet last week. He threw at Citi Field in the rain. “Just progressively increasing the distance, and usually anywhere from 60 to 70 pitches,” he said. ”I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "With the inaugural anniversary of President Bola Tinubu’s administration coming up in a few days, IMOLEAYO OYEDEYI examines how far it has gone in fulfilling 25 per cent of its Renewed Hope Agenda to the Nigerian people In a few days, President Bola Tinubu will be celebrating his first anniversary as the 16th President of Nigeria. For many political observers, the inaugural anniversary aptly presents an opportunity to assess how far the much promising Tinubu’s government has gone in inspiring hope for millions of Nigerians since May 2023 when it came into power amid sheer hopelessness that almost sank the country under his predecessor. Worried by the prevailing despondency and misery that plagued the country under the Muhammadu Buhari regime, President Bola Tinubu, upon his assumption of office, vowed to rescue the supposed Africa’s giant from the claws of economic retrogression, deep-seated hardship, and worsening insecurity. Premising its roadmap on key national issues such as security, economy, agriculture, power, oil and gas, transportation, and education, Tinubu’s campaign train, in the build-up to the 2023 election, issued an 80-page policy document, which highlighted an eight-point blueprint for its Renewed Hope Agenda. Tinubu and wife, Oluremi waving In the manifesto published in October 2022, President Tinubu said his objective would foster a new society based on shared prosperity, tolerance, compassion, and the unwavering commitment to treating each citizen with equal respect and due regard. Among his glowing pledges contained in the campaign document, the President, if given the mandate, promised to “build a Nigeria, especially for our youth, where sufficient jobs with decent wages create a better life.” He also said his government would “manufacture, create, and invent more of the goods and services we require. Nigeria shall be known as a nation of creators, not just of consumers.” Under his watch, President Tinubu said Nigeria would “export more and import less, strengthening both the naira and our way of life.” He also promised to continue assisting the country’s ever-toiling farmers through enlightened agricultural policy that would promote productivity and assure decent incomes, so that farmers could support their families and feed the nation. The President said his government would “modernise and expand public infrastructure so that the rest of the economy can grow at an optimal rate, embolden and support our young people and women by harnessing emerging sectors such as the digital economy, entertainment and culture, tourism and others to build the Nigeria of tomorrow, today.” Tinubu waving His campaign promises also include “training and giving economic opportunity to the poorest and most vulnerable among us. We seek a Nigeria where no parent is compelled to send a child to bed hungry, worried whether tomorrow shall bring food.” More importantly on the economic front, Tinubu said his administration would “generate, transmit and distribute sufficient, affordable electricity to give our people the requisite power to enlighten their lives, their homes, and their very dreams.” He also promised to “make basic healthcare, education, and housing accessible and affordable for all and most importantly, establish a bold and assertive policy that will create a strong yet adaptive national security architecture and action to obliterate terror, kidnapping, banditry, and all other forms of violent extremism from the face of our nation.” During his inauguration which came in May, a few months after his victory in the 2023 presidential election, Tinubu also harped on his messianic policy to replace the despair on the faces of many Nigerians with joy and revive their fading hope in the ever-failing governance of the country. While delivering his inaugural speech with striking gallantry at the Eagles Square, Abuja on that sunny Monday afternoon, the President said, “Our administration shall govern on your behalf but never rule over you. We shall consult and dialogue but never dictate. We shall reach out to all but never put down a single person for holding views contrary to our own. We are here to further mend and heal this nation, not tear and injure it.” Given the numerous promises to Nigerians, observers have said it is expedient to examine how far the Tinubu’s administration has gone in delivering the expected 25 per cent of its Renewed Hope Agenda having been in the saddle for nearly 12 months. In their assessments, some of the analysts said the current government has so far fulfilled his ‘hit-the-ground-running’ pledge by implementing tough economic policies and rejigging Nigeria’s security apparatus, which they said, has tamed the rampaging monster of insecurity in the country even though there are still flashes of banditry as 40 people were massacred in Plateau State recently. Others opined that the timing and manner in which the government has initiated and implemented some of its policies had not been very strategic and mass-appealing, culminating in more hardship for Nigerians and severe battery for the economy. Reacting to the criticisms, Vice President Kashim Shettima, however, defended the bold reforms of the Tinubu’s administration, saying the government came in at a critical period when there was a strong need to take some unpalatable and drastic measures in other to rescue the country’s dwindling economic situation from total collapse. Speaking at the first edition of the Asiwaju Scorecard Series organised by the All Progressives Congress Professionals Forum in Abuja on Tuesday, Shettima said the ongoing reforms were becoming seemingly problematic for Nigerians because the Tinubu’s administration was not seeking shortcuts in its determination to revive the country’s ailing economy. He said, “In our quest for economic recovery, we must recognise that we are not here to cut corners. The path we have chosen is necessary. Indeed, His Excellency, President Boal Tinubu, has made the difficult but necessary choices to ensure Nigeria’s long-term stability and prosperity are never in doubt. He has chosen a path that, although demanding, promises to save our nation from economic downfall.” Recall that Tinubu’s administration began its flurry of policies with the pronounced removal of fuel subsidies. Though its predecessor did not make provision for a six-month subsidy payment in the 2023 national budget, many people had argued that President Tinubu ought to have made wide consultations across the board and devised workable strategies to cushion the harsh economic effects of the fuel subsidy removal before pronouncing it during his inaugural speech. The present government also floated the Nigerian currency twice which resulted in severe disruption in the country’s forex market, raising a nationwide outcry. However, the government has since stuck to its guns and resisted all pressures mounted by the CSOs and labour unions to force a reversal of the decision. Even though the CBN in tandem with other agencies of the government like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was able to launch and implement aggressive policies that appreciated the value of the naira in the interim, the country has not been able to fully get over the economic turmoil caused by the fuel subsidy removal and the deregulation of the FX market. Sharing his viewpoint on the 25 per cent scorecard of the current administration, especially in economic development, the Lead Investment Advisor at AfriVest (West Africa) Limited, a Nigerian capital market holding company with specialised subsidiaries focusing on the unique but integrated wealth management needs of clients in West Africa, Omosuyi Temitope, told Saturday PRIMANEWS that though the current administration lagged on major economic indicators that mattered to the average Nigerian, there were still hopes that its policies and reforms would deliver the needed impacts in the long term. “I will look at the performance from two viewpoints for a balanced assessment. On the policy/reforms front, this administration has taken several bold and almost unprecedented steps across both fiscal and monetary policy to address Nigeria’s economic quagmire. We have seen courageous moves on subsidy removal, unification of the foreign exchange market, student loans, national credit schemes, fiscal prudence, and the electricity sector, just to mention a few, although many have not achieved their intended impact due to many setbacks in implementation. “However, policy and reforms are means to an end. The end is to improve Nigerian welfare. This takes me to the second performance index: macroeconomic indicators. This administration has lagged on major economic indicators that matter to the average Nigerian. The inflation rate has reached its highest levels in decades. The exchange rate hit its highest level in history. Economic growth at barely 3% for a developing country like ours is less inclusive. Oil production has not improved massively. Our foreign reserves are still heavily encumbered, not to mention Nigeria’s rising fiscal vulnerability from mounting debt stock and its impact on government liquidity,” the AfriVest analyst explained. He added, “There are a myriad of disturbing challenges that now keep the country on the verge of a social crisis, especially from food and energy insecurity. While the reform measures taken look laudable and have a potent positive sentiment for foreign investors, the actual performance of the economy is critical to the nation’s stability going forward. “For this administration, it is not time to count gains yet if more Nigerians do not have access to or cannot afford adequate food and energy compared to previous years, irrespective of the cause. In short, people’s welfare is the most important scorecard, and that has fared poorly in the last year.” Also speaking with Saturday PRIMANEWS on the President’s first-year scorecard, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises, Dr Muda Yusuf, said, “One of the major commitments and achievements of the present administration was to correct some of the fundamental distortions in the economy, especially distortions in the micro-economic environment, those around fuel pricing and the subsidy issue as well as the unbelievable level of criminality that has pervaded the oil producing areas over the years and some other issues. “One of the major tasks was to rescue the economy from the brink because it was already at the brink as of the time the administration took over. Although the consequences of the macroeconomic weaknesses did not manifest under the previous administration, if we had continued on that trajectory, the consequences could have been more devastating than the cost of current reforms. So, the steps that have been taken to correct the distortions in the foreign exchange market and the petroleum downstream sector are major foundational steps. “This is because you cannot build something on nothing. You need to correct those distortions before you can begin to do some other more visible things. Unfortunately, the reforms have come with a lot of pains that have triggered inflationary pressures, which have affected businesses in many ways. But I believe that these are difficult choices that need to be made. If you don’t have a strong foundation, you cannot have a stable superstructure. So, I think we should acknowledge those steps and efforts that have been made to correct or to manage the outcomes of those corrective reforms.” Yusuf further said, “From the revenue perspective, we have seen a remarkable increase, both to the Federal Government and state governments as well as the local governments. We now have revenue in the federation account at a level that has not been seen in many years. I think this is something we need to acknowledge. Whether these revenues have been spent properly is a different matter. “However, from a fiscal consolidation point of view, some significant levels of improvements have been made. Some of the losses and corruption problems that characterised the Foreign Exchange market have been reduced. Though we are still contending with volatility in the FX market, because the exchange rate has depreciated significantly, it is still a work in progress.” He noted, “We have also seen some other measures such as the electricity sector reform. The decentralisation of the power sector is something we need to also acknowledge because it implies opening up the space for private investors and both the state governments and local governments. In the long run, I expect this to attract a lot of capital in terms of investment, both domestic and foreign, into the power sector.” Going forward, the economist said there was still a lot of work to be done by the current administration to moderate the level of inflation because the impact of the high inflationary pressure on peoples’ welfare had been enormous. He said, “We need to see some measures taken to bring down the cost of living. We also need to see a lot more in the area of reviewing the strategy for tackling insecurity, because this is also a very big problem. Of course, we have seen some progress with regards to road infrastructure, structural issues affecting productivity in the economy, and some investments.” Commenting on the inaugural anniversary of the Renewed Hope government, a Senior Special Assistant to the President on Public Engagement, Fredrick Nwabufo, in a recent statement, said there were still some notable wins recorded by the administration in nearly one year. He said, “The intangibles of leadership are as potent and profound as the corporeal manifestations of governance. People must not only see the brick-and-mortar elements of leadership; they must also feel and sense leadership in its quantum of compassion, healing, solace, and capacity to inspire unity, as well as foster peace and progress. “The ongoing epochal Lagos-Calabar Coastal Road, with its attendant immense economic and social benefits to many states within and outside that corridor; the Sokoto-Badagry Road project, and the completed Port Harcourt to Aba stretch of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri narrow-gauge rail, among other key developments across the nation, assert the all-encompassing and genuine intentionality of President Tinubu’s administration to nation building. “Within the first year, the President also approved the upgrade of key health infrastructure and equipment across all six geo-political zones, in line with his administration’s vision of overhauling the health and social welfare sector for enhanced service delivery to all Nigerians.” He added, “The take-off of the first phase of the Consumer Credit Scheme, which is essentially a mitochondrion enabling citizens to improve their quality of life by accessing goods and services upfront, paying responsibly over time, and by the same token bolstering local industry and stimulating job creation, is another social cohesion sealant – with all classes of working Nigerians as beneficiaries.” However, the second year of the ‘Emilokan’ government begins on June 1 and only time will tell how far it will go in turning the country’s waning fortunes around.",

        "content": "The MLA representing the Cumberland House community says Saskatchewan’s premier should experience for himself a ride on Highway 123. After rains and spring conditions washed out the highway and made it largely impassable, Cumberland House officials last week declared a state of emergency for the village as well as the nearby Cree Nation. The highway serves as the lone road into the northern Saskatchewan community. Cumberland MLA Doyle Vermette on Monday criticized the provincial government for its lack of any tangible service towards fixing the problem. Vermette challenged Premier Scott Moe to drive Highway 123 himself, to experience just once what area residents are having to deal with in their day-to-day lives. “I have an invitation for the premier: Let’s meet where the pavement ends and I’ll let you drive and see it for yourself,” Vermette said. “I don’t think this government realizes how bad our road is.” Janelle Thomas, who started a petition on Change.org calling for improved highway infrastructure, said those using the road face “nearly impossible travel conditions.” “Transport vehicles carrying gasoline, food, and other necessities are getting stuck because of freight weight,” Thomas wrote. “Ambulances cannot make it through the muddy roads, putting our sick and elderly residents at risk of further illness or even death.” Moe last week said the Cumberland House community will be a “priority for conversations” with the provincial highways department. “We’ll work with the community on any immediate challenges that they have and also work with the community on what the investment looks like for that road in the future, and I would say it needs to be more, not less,” Moe said. Cumberland House is located approximately 450 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. The village and the First Nation each have a population of between 700 and 800 people. Opposition NDP Leader Carla Beck on Monday said people in Saskatchewan shouldn’t have to struggle to have access to medicine, food and fuel. “Cumberland House is in a state of emergency and the local leaders I’ve heard from rightly feel the government is not doing everything in its power to help,” Beck said. Cumberland House Mayor Ferlin McKay last week said the “deplorable and deteriorating conditions” of the highway “puts the health and well-being of our community members in jeopardy.” Cumberland Cree Nation Chief Rene Chaboyer said government action is urgently needed to address “the dire situation” on Highway 123. “We need a safe and reliable access for emergency services, food supplies, and vital resources,” Chaboyer added. Beck said a short-term fix should include the government deploying road builders and other resources — including airlifts, if needed — to ensure safe and reliable traffic, goods and supplies for the community. Beyond that, a long-term fix is necessary, she added. According to the NDP on Monday, highways critic Trent Wotherspoon and Vermette wrote a letter to Highways Minister Lori Carr on May 6, urging the government to take appropriate action and Carr responded on May 23 that government officials were “optimistic” that “conditions will improve significantly.” The next day, a state of emergency was declared.

        "content": ": A video of Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi's Power Minister, Atishi Marlena, announcing the 'termination' of the free electricity subsidy scheme in New Delhi is going viral on social media. In the video, the minister can be heard saying that tomorrow onwards, the subsidy scheme will not be applied to \"new electricity bills, starting tomorrow.\" The video is being shared to claim that the statement was made recently, amid the ongoing 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Those sharing the video are asking people to vote carefully. : This video has been clipped from a press conference held on 14 April 2023, and is not related to the 2024 general elections. In 2023, Atishi spoke about the electricity subsidy being stopped in Delhi, due to a tiff between the state's AAP government and the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi VK Saxena. Team WebQoof had published a fact-check on the same clipped video in 2023, when it was being shared with misleading context. We ran a reverse image search using Google, which led us to a X (formerly Twitter) by news agency ANI, carrying updates from an AAP press conference. The thread carried the same visuals, and was shared on 14 April 2023. | From today, the subsidized electricity given to the people of Delhi will be stopped. This means from tomorrow, the subsidized bills will not be given. This subsidy is stopped because AAP govt has taken the decision to continue subsidy for the coming year, but that file... We also found news reports related to the press conference by India Today and Mint, also published in April 2023. n the conference, Atishi called out LG Saxena's office for holding up files related to the subsidy scheme. She said that funds for the scheme could not be released without clearance from the LG's end, and that she was unable to set an appointment with him. After this press conference, the LG's office dismissed her statements, claiming they were misleading and false. Later that day, the free electricity subsidy scheme was extended for the year 2023-24, with LG Saxena's approval. : The video dates back to April 2023 and is not related to the ongoing general elections.",

        "content": "We wrap up the first round of the women’s singles on Day 3 of the French Open. 20 matches are scheduled, and–as always–we here at LastWordOnTennis will share our thoughts on all of them with you. We split the day’s matches between five articles. In addition to this one, the other four feature Victoria Azarenka vs Nadia Podoroska , Qinwen Zheng vs Alize Cornet , Elena Rybakina vs Greet Minnen , and Aryna Sabalenka vs Erika Andreeva . Predicting these matches are Jordan Reynolds, Manuel Traquete, and Yesh Ginsburg. French Open Day 3 Predictions Jordan: Yuan beat Sherif last month in Rouen. However, the Egyptian was playing one of her first matches since returning from injury. Sherif’s level is much higher now. She reached the final in Morocco heading this event. Her best level on clay is better than Yuan’s, who is more comfortable on hard courts. The Egyptian is the favorite to get her revenge here. Prediction: Sherif in 2 Manuel: Yuan might be higher ranked, but she struggles a lot on clay, as shown by her getting here on the back of four consecutive losses. Sherif, on the other hand, is comfortable on this surface and fresh off a final in Rabat. She should be able to advance here. Prediction: Sherif in 2 Yesh: Sherif is a much better player, especially on clay. Don’t let their recent meeting fool you. As long as the Egyptian is healthy, she should win easily. Prediction: Sherif in 2 Jordan: Italian veteran Errani showed she still has some good tennis left in her by coming through the qualifying as the No. 1 seed. Can her gritty style have further success in the main draw? It is not impossible, with Schmiedlova also not possessing a big weapon in her game. But the Slovakian’s extra energy as a younger player might mean that Errani’s efforts to reach this point might prove crucial in the end. Prediction: Schmiedlova in 3 Manuel: Errani is a former finalist at this tournament, but this year she actually had to go through qualifying to even reach the main draw. She is still someone who really knows how to play on this surface and might well be able to at least win a match here. Prediction: Errani in 3 Yesh: Errani is a once-great player who still has flashes of greatness , but as the years go one they’re fewer and further between. Does she have one last bit of magic in her? Against a not-so-in-form opponent, I think there’s a chance. Prediction: Errani in 3 Jordan: Navarro is capable of making a major breakthrough at the French Open, with her game best suited to clay. The quickly improving American is not a great draw for Sonmez. Navarro’s heavy forehand and consistency should see her sail into the next round. Prediction: Navarro in 2 Manuel: Navarro has played a lot on clay this year and showed a very good level on some occasions. Facing a player coming from qualifying, the World #24 should be able to advance to the second round here. Prediction: Navarro in 2 Yesh: Emma Navarro is a potential rising star, ready to take the college tennis mantle with Danielle Collins’ imminent retirement. And she’s charging towards the Top 10. She might never win a Major, but she’ll go deep in plenty of events. Prediction: Navarro in 2 Jordan: Keys is one of the most in-form players on clay, winning the title in Strasbourg heading into the second Grand Slam of the year. In fact, only Iga Swiatek has beaten her on the dirt so far this season. All signs point to the American winning again against Zarazua, who is a capable player but is not good enough to stop Keys at her current level. Prediction: Keys in 2 Manuel: Keys is fresh off a fantastic title run in Strasbourg, where she didn’t drop a single set, and on paper she got a very kind draw here, facing someone outside the Top 100. Assuming she still has a lot left in the tank after last week, she should be able to breeze through this opening round. Prediction: Keys in 2 Yesh: It’s been a long time since Zarazua stunned Serena Williams at this event. Almost a decade later, against another elite American, I expect the result to be much different.

Earlier this month, Ozzy expressed that he would \"jump at the chance\" to play a final Black Sabbath show with Bill on the episode of The Madhouse Chronicles. While Bill hasn't responded to the frontman's request, Tony opened up about the potential during an appearance on SiriusXM’s Trunk Nation with Eddie Trunk. He admitted he would be , saying it \"would be nice to do a one-off.\" The guitarist said that we would not be able to commit to extended tours due to his age, so a one-off farewell performance could be the best option. \"I have to look at it realistically at my age. I can’t go out and do a two-year tour like we were doing before,\" the said. \"And to put something together like the original Sabbath or this or that or the other, you’ve gotta do it a long time because of the cost of everything.” \"That’d be a nice thing to actually do, but whether it happens will be another thing,\" he added. \"But we’ll see. I mean, who knows?\" He said that while he thought everybody would think they would be reuniting for money, that \"wouldn’t be\" the case in this scenario. Ozzy announced his retirement from touring last year, but he has previously expressed regret for not having a proper farewell show for his fans. His wife Sharon Osbourne also previously shared that there were plans for two farewell shows before the singer fully retires from doing live shows, saying that Ozzy’s voice remains in good shape even with . Bill dropped out of their planned reunion in 2012 citing an \"unreasonable contract.\" He has yet to respond to his bandmate's plea for a reunion.
