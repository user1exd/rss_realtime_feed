        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. Storms earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. For more information on recent tornado reports, see The Associated Press .

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA:",

        "content": ": At least six people have died in West Bengal after Cyclone Remal made landfall in the Sundarbans delta between Sagar Island of South 24 Parganas and Khepupara in Bangladesh on Sunday night and brought heavy rains that destroyed properties and crops in the plains of the eastern state. Most of the deaths were due to electrocution. Two among them, Phorey Singh and his young son Tarun, were from Memari in Burdwan East. They came in contact with a live wire while removing an uprooted banana tree after the cyclone and died. At Panihati in North 24 Parganas, Gopal Burman (47) lost his life after he touched an electric wire that was illegally routed from a pole to a shop but got snapped and was lying on the road. At Maheshtala in South 24 Parganas, a woman, Tapasi Das (53), was electrocuted after she stepped onto a live wire lying in a waterlogged road. Meanwhile another woman, Renuka Mondal (80), died at Mousuni Island in South 24 Parganas after a tree fell on her house. At Entally in central Kolkata, a man, Mohammad Sajid (51), died after a concrete chunk got dislodged from the balcony of a house and fell on him. In Kolkata, a nightlong downpour left many roads from North to South either waterlogged or blocked by uprooted trees. This led to cancellation of the Lok Sabha election campaign rallies of many ruling and Opposition party leaders for the second day, ahead of the final phase of polls on June 1. The rain is likely to continue Tuesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to lead a roadshow in Kolkata North parliamentary constituency in support of BJP candidate Tapas Roy after addressing a rally in Barasat in North 24 Parganas. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee posted on X: “West Bengal is a riverine state, on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. So we have to face various natural disasters every year. This time also, massive damage has occurred and is taking place in our state due to the impact of Cyclone Remale.” She said: “But human life comes above everything. Fortunately and certainly due to the steps of the state administration, the loss of life this time is relatively less. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased. Financial assistance will be reached to their loved ones immediately.” The CM said: “The administration will now look into the distribution of compensation for the damage to crops and houses as per the law and we will consider these issues more seriously once the model code of conduct ends. Our administration was prepared this time at all levels for disaster management despite the business of election arrangement.” She added: “From the chief secretary to the entire secretariat of my state to the district administration to the block administration -- all unitedly stand by the people and will continue to do so in disaster management in future. Our municipalities panchayats also have the credit of moving two lakh people to 1,400 camps in safe places. For this, I express my sincere thanks to all in the state and local administration. I firmly believe that with the cooperation of all we shall overcome this storm too. I know you are worried over this disaster. We are worried also. But don't be afraid, don't worry. We will do everything necessary to deal with the situation.”",

        "description": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain.",
        "content": "Soaring plains temperatures have driven millions to overcrowded hill stations in Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh, causing massive traffic jams and environmental strain. Usually, the hill stations of North India remain pleasant from March to the end of May. However, these months have alternated between severe cold and scorching heat this year. In 2024, the spring season was essentially lost between winter and summer. The number of tourists and locals in Kashmir has far exceeded its capacity. The increasing number of concrete buildings to accommodate them and the huge crowd of vehicles have disrupted nature, resulting in variable weather conditions. Kashmir, which has always been a top choice for tourists, is now disappointing them due to uncertain weather conditions. March and April, which mark the beginning of spring, had unexpected snowfall, rain, and severe cold until the third week of April. Suddenly, it became scorching hot with temperatures 5-7 degrees above normal. April was the coldest month in the last 20 years, and now May is the hottest month in the last 35 years. In recent years, whenever temperatures in the plains have soared and there has been no respite from the scorching sun, millions of tourists have flocked to the hill stations of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. This has led to massive traffic jams and tourist footfall far beyond the capacity of these ecologically sensitive areas. Experts say this can irreversibly damage the fragile ecosystem of these areas. The same is happening with Kashmir, where famous hill stations like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonmarg, and many other places are overcrowded. The rapid construction of hotels, huts, and resorts is leading to the felling of green trees for new developments. As a result, the scorching heat in Kashmir has made life miserable. The Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department said there will be no respite from the heatwave in Jammu and Kashmir for at least the next 15 days. He further stated that the region is facing variable weather, with sudden heat and heavy rains, and these conditions will increase. He noted that humans will have to adapt to this variability, which is largely due to large-scale urbanization. Mukhtar Ahmed, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said that the temperature in Jammu and Kashmir has been dry for the last few weeks, and the heat is continuously increasing. Even in the hilly areas, the mercury has risen to 30 degrees Celsius. In the hilly areas of Jammu, temperatures are around 35 degrees, and in the plains of Jammu, they have reached 43 degrees. The heat is expected to continue in the coming days. He added, \"Of course, the uncontrolled temperature of the Earth is increasing globally, and this is true for Jammu and Kashmir as well. Rapid urbanization is contributing to higher daytime temperatures. Our infrastructure, urbanization, massive transportation, and increased factory activities all impact the temperature. Infrastructure development at tourist spots, and increased tourism in recent years, also contribute to rising temperatures.\" The number of tourists in Kashmir has increased by 200 percent in the last five years. COVID-19 restrictions have changed people's mindsets, making them more willing to spend money on domestic travel. They are prioritizing domestic travel over international travel. Air travel to Kashmir is more expensive than to Delhi-Dubai, yet people choose Kashmir. Tourists now spend large amounts on domestic travel, a trend not seen earlier, and they visit Kashmir even in the off-season. Last year, Jammu and Kashmir received the highest number of tourists since independence, with 21.1 million tourists, including pilgrims. There was a 700 percent increase in foreign tourists in the valley. In 2024, more than 1.1 million tourists have reached Kashmir so far, excluding pilgrims to Mata Vaishno Devi. Eight more flights are operating compared to last year, with an average of 18,000 tourists arriving in Kashmir daily, and more than 5,000 arriving by road. According to available data, Kashmir has 100 percent occupancy until July. The sharp rise in tourism is not limited to Kashmir alone. Tourist places in North India like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Shimla, Manali, Mussoorie, Nainital, and Dalhousie are also packed with tourists. The increasing rush from the plains to the mountains has further aggravated environmental problems, such as damage to the fragile hill ecosystem, plastic pollution, air pollution, unpredictable traffic jams, and the construction of new concrete buildings to host tourists. Many in the tourism industry are concerned about these changes and want Kashmir to become a sustainable tourist destination for future generations. They warn that if the current trend continues unchecked, it will destroy the glory of Kashmir. Manzoor Pakhtoon, General Secretary of the Kashmir Houseboat Association, said, \"Kashmir is a famous place in summers. It is hot during the day, but not unbearably so. Our virgin destinations are crowded with tourists. We should take care of them. Whether it is the government or the common man, we should see how we can make it a sustainable place and save our wetlands and glaciers.\" Pakhtoon added, \"When it comes to the environment, it is not just about tourism. We also live here and need to take good care of our forests and mountains. A pressure group should be formed to protect the environment and our future. New destinations should be built with an eco-friendly approach, not as concrete jungles. This is just the beginning. If we take care today, maybe things can improve.\" Nowadays, tourists visiting Kashmir already feel the change in its climate and say they did not expect such heat in hill stations like Kashmir. Many compare it with their previous visits and note significant changes. They report heavy traffic jams and widespread pollution as reasons for the change. A tourist, Sharda Jain from Gwalior, said, \"We came to Kashmir for the cold and thought the weather would be pleasant, but we encountered scorching heat. Global warming and a lot of tourist traffic could be reasons.\" A tourist from Mumbai, Ashok, said, \"Globalization is also having a significant impact. Many hotels are being built, affecting the environment. Nature is getting destroyed. It is everyone's responsibility, whether common people or the government, to work for a better future.\" Ashok's daughter, Aayushi, added, \"I visited Kashmir in 2006. The Kashmir I saw then is not the same as today. There is much more population, pollution, and crowding. The weather was cold then, but now it is hot.\" A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that sudden floods, cloudbursts, and intense rains will become more likely in mountainous regions. The report states that rising temperatures and melting glaciers will seriously impact plant and animal species already struggling with heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, and floods. It further states that climate change will cause temperatures to rise in all regions in the coming decades, especially in South Asia. Heatwaves will increase, the hot season will become longer, and the cold season shorter. Mukhtar Ahmad, Director of the Kashmir Meteorology Department, said, \"This temperature increase is what we call variable climate. It is going to increase over time. For every 1-degree increase in temperature, the moisture-holding capacity of the air increases by around 7 percent. This will result in sudden heavy rains and prolonged dry weather. We must be prepared for this variability.\" A climate scientist from Kashmir University said that the current temperatures align with predictions made about climate change impacts. What India is experiencing is due to the warming of the Earth. He warned that the worst is yet to come, saying, \"As the Earth gets hotter, we will see more extreme heat conditions. This year, we have seen hotter weather than ever before. The kind of heat we saw in April-May was expected in June-July.\" Climate experts say that the ever-increasing influx of tourists to the mountains of North India has made the current situation very difficult. A long-term strategy is urgently needed to mitigate the impending disasters of climate change and over-tourism.",

        "description": "Walton was a dominant force in college, leading UCLA to two national championships, a two-time NBA champion and a Hall of Famer. He died Monday after a long battle with cancer, the NBA announced.",
        "content": "Two-time NBA champion and NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton has passed away following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced on Monday. Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke - a former NBA player and now a coach. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. \"One of my guards said, 'Let's try something else,\" Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden's response during that timeout: \"Why? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. \"It's very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA's program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. \"As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It's hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.\" The first overall pick of the 1974 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, the 6-foot-11 Walton played 10 seasons in the NBA, winning championships with the Blazers (1977) and the Boston Celtics (1986). He averaged a double-double over his career, totaling 6,215 points (13.3 per game), 4,923 rebounds (10.5 per game), 1,034 blocks (2.2 per game) and 1,590 assists. A two-time All-Star, he led the NBA in rebounding and blocks in 1977 and was the league's Sixth Man of the Year in 1986. After his NBA career, Walton turned to broadcasting where he entertained generations of basketball fans. in 2002 as a lead analyst for NBA games before shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. Walton was an Emmy winner. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a \"Deadhead.\" And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the \"Conference of Champions\" and loved it all the way to the end. \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" ---",

        "content": "An appraiser working with a bank fled with 2.17 kg of gold ornaments worth `1.44 crore that was mortgaged by customers. The incident came to light when the bank audited its branch at Rajupet of Mangapet mandal in Mulugu district earlier this week. Sub-inspector Ravi Kumar identified the accused as Sammeta Prashanth of Palaigudem of the mandal and a native of Narsampet in Warangal district. During their audit, bank officials found that there was a mismatch between the gold on record and in the vaults. The officials took the issue to the notice of branch manager Kiran Kumar who in turn tried to contact appraiser Prashanth. That is when they learnt that Prashanth along with his family had left the village without informing anyone. The bank officials then lodged a complaint with the police. After registering a case, police found during their investigation that Prashanth had opened a gold shop in Rajupet and had also borrowed money from several persons from the surrounding villages. Police have formed special teams to search and arrest Prashanth. Regional deputy general manager Srinivas Rao of the bank who visited the Rajupet branch to enquire about the theft assured that those who had mortgaged their jewellery need not worry. The bank would return an equal amount of gold or money at market value as preferred by the customers, he said.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — The mother of a young southern Utah boy who nearly drowned last week provided another update over the weekend on her son’s condition and the decisions her family will have to make moving forward. Kallie Wright posted to Facebook on Sunday that the days since her son, Levi, was pulled unresponsive from a swift-moving creek have been a “rollercoaster” experience. “We are taking it day by day,” she said in the most recent post. On the evening of May 21, Levi was playing on his toy tractor when he fell into a creek in Beaver County. Emergency crews found the child in the water roughly a mile downstream. Levi, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright , is currently receiving care at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. Days after the accident, Levi briefly woke up , bringing hope for a recovery. Yet, his mother noted in a follow-up social media post that the child wasn’t fully coherent or talking in that moment, only that he opened his eyes for a short period of time and “wiggled with purpose.” On Friday, an MRI brought more difficult news for the family. Still, Kallie wrote that they were trying to get as many neurologists as possible to view her son’s brain scan. In her most recent post on Sunday, the mother noted that the term “brain injury” is broad, with different ranges and severities, and that recovery varies depending on the specific injury. “We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us and getting as many professional eyes on this as possible,” Kallie Wright wrote. She added: “We still just need the prayers. We will need them for years to come as I fear we haven’t even reached the hardest part of this.”",

        "content": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021. One person was killed in the violence, and two others suffered life-threatening injuries due to the use of a gun. The harshest sentence was nearly 30 years in prison, and the lowest sentence was closer to four years. The verdict and sentences were read by the court at the Schiphol judicial complex in Haarlemmermeer on Monday. Seven of the robberies took place in Noord-Holland, and the other was in Dreumel, Gelderland. The most severe sentence was given to 31-year-old Glenn V. from Noord-Scharwoude. Prosecutors had called for a life sentence against him, but the court said that was \"not appropriate\" in his case. The court took into consideration that he was not out to kill people, and that he is still relatively young. V., who has a long criminal record, received the maximum prison sentence allowable short of a life sentence. After his imprisonment, he will be placed under supervision due to the risk of recurrence. Just as the Public Prosecution Service did, the court holds him responsible for the violence committed with firearms. According to the court, he shot 72-year-old Sjaak Groot during a robbery in Berkhou. He was also convicted of shooting two victims in the neck and chest during robberies in Avenhorn and Noord-Scharwoude. His co-defendants include Rotterdam resident Ruviëni M., 39, who was handed a 27-year prison sentence. Deniz R., a 28-year-old from Obdam, was ordered to serve 25 years in prison. Mark V., 31 and from Opmeer, was handed 20 years in prison. M. and R. were given sentences slightly lower than what prosecutors demanded, partly because the court did not believe the evidence they were involved in the shootings was strong enough. Mark V. had a permanent role as the crew's driver. The court spoke of a sustained and structured collaboration between the four men, who were also guilty of participation in a criminal organization. The four, previously described by the Public Prosecution Service as a core group, were involved in almost all robberies. Two men who each participated in one home robbery, former Alkmaar resident Dut M. (30) and Martijn G. (28) from Heerhugowaard, received prison sentences of 6.5 years and three years and nine months respectively. The Public Prosecution Service had also demanded that M. spend time in mandatory psychiatric treatment at a TBS facility, but the court did not see justification in imposing the measure. All suspects except M. were present at the verdict reading, in which the court paid separate attention to the enormous impact the robberies had. Many victims still suffer from physical and psychological complaints, and suffer from nightmares and flashbacks. Some have even moved away. With the exception of G., the men have denied or remained silent about involvement in the crimes.",

        "content": "No spectators will be allowed in the stands at FC Utrecht's next home football match in the Eredivisie. Mayor Sharon Dijksma decided to impose the measure in response to rioting by the team's supporters on Sunday when the FC Utrecht was lost out on the chance to play in European football next season. \"I am aware that this is unique, but given the situation last Sunday, this is an appropriate measure. Also, I will not hesitate to disallow an audience at other matches if this situation repeats itself,\" Dijksma wrote on Monday in a letter to the City Council. According to the mayor, FC Utrecht understands the reason for the decision. Additionally, nets must be hung on the sides of the away section in the FC Utrecht stadium. These should prevent them from throwing fireworks and other items back and forth. Dijksma is considering measures against a café near the stadium where a group of rioters are said to have gathered. Just outside the stadium is a slate plateau. Those stones will be removed because the rioters took them from the street to throw as weapons. The municipality wants to recover the costs. FC Utrecht lost to Go Ahead Eagles on Sunday, and therefore did not qualify for the preliminary round of the Conference League. There was unrest in the stadium during the match, and riots broke out outside afterwards. According to the mayor, Utrecht supporters threw a variety of objects at riot police, like \"large rocks, manhole covers, gutters, bicycles, fireworks and all the material that was available on the street.\" Two people from the Utrecht region have been arrested. One officer ended up in a hospital after losing consciousness, according to Dijksma. The mayor says she met with officers on Sunday. \"The pressure on our officers has been enormous for weeks and the sum of the physical and verbal violence they constantly have to deal with is taking a very heavy toll on them.\" Dijksma has therefore appealed for calm. \"It is really essential to find calmer waters together, because this situation is no longer sustainable. We can no longer sustain this together.\" It is not yet known when FC Utrecht will play its first home match and who the opponent will be. The first round of the Eredivisie will take place on August 9, 10 and 11, with the second round a week later.",

        "content": "The Financial Market Authority (AFM) received over 20 percent more reports and questions about fraud and scams in the first quarter of this year. The regulator has also noticed that scammers find new ways to take people's money. The AFM now wants to use a website to better educate the Dutch about how fraudsters and scammers work. The AFM receives reports via the Financial Markets Complaint Desk. This often involves investment fraud, where people are tricked into investing money. Fraudsters also place fake advertisements that look like Dutch celebrities are giving investment advice. According to the AFM, the hotline has also recently received signals about new scamming methods. These include fraudsters posing as AFM employees and scamming their victims again. Due to the increasing number of reports, the supervisory authority has set up the website . There, Dutch people can learn more about the different types of fraud and how they can protect themselves against them. They can also check whether a company they are contacting is known to the AFM.",

        "description": "The family-friendly pizza restaurant has had its first major refurbishment since opening in 1994, adding a new ice cream and churro bar.",
        "content": "I introduced the third generation of the family to Di Maggio’s East Kilbride when we took the kids for dinner at the revamped restaurant. I’m old enough to remember being taken here by my parents when the pizza and pasta restaurant opened here in 1994. The first Di Maggio’s restaurant was established when Mario Gizzi went into partnership with his uncle Giuseppe “Joe” Conetta, opening in 1984 in the West End. Themed around American baseball legend Joe Di Maggio, there was an American Italian menu of pizza, pasta, burgers and ribs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. It was during the 1990s that Joe’s son, Tony, joined his cousin in the family business. They went on to launch Cafe Andaluz, Amarone and turned Glasgow’s oldest Italian restaurant, La Ariosto, into the Barolo Grill. The group now has 19 restaurants of various hues and plans for expansion. What's the Story? The East Kilbride restaurant has had a major reimagining, kitted out with a churro bar and gelateria, Churissimo. Tony Conetta said: “We’ve been serving the community of East Kilbride for more than 30 years and this is a huge moment in our history in the town. A tremendous amount of love and care has gone into the refurbishment, and we’re sure the introduction of EK’s first authentic churro bar will go down a treat. “We love being a part of East Kilbride, we’ve welcomed thousands of families through our doors, and we look forward to thousands more. It’s also about playing a part in bringing new people to the town, and we hope the new-look Di Maggio’s East Kilbride and Churissimo will achieve that for the next 30 years.” On the Menu Churros and ice cream If you grew up in and around Glasgow then you are probably familiar with Di Maggio’s Glaswegian approximation of a New York pizza. What’s new here is the steady supply of freshly made churros - there’s bite sized portions for the kits, churros dusted with sugar and cinnamon for the adults or filled with white chocolate, Nutella or salted caramel. Advertisement Advertisement Dips include Belgian chocolate or biscoff bueno flavour. There’s 12 ice cream flavours like chocolate fudge brownie, strawberry cheesecake or raspberry ripple. It’s a modern take on the classic Italian cafe with some Iberian sweet treats on top, a nod to the group’s success with Spanish tapas at Cafe Andaluz. Atmosphere There’s space for 220 customers here, it’s a big dining room but there’s plenty of space between tables which helps when wee ones are going back and forth to the compact soft play area tucked away in the corner. The renovation has created a smart space with plenty of tables and booths to suit different sizes of parties, some allusions to art deco and vintage prints on the wall. We went early on a Thursday night and the place was busy with other families and couples meeting up after work. Verdict Our seven-year-old, an expert on pizza Margherita was impressed with his cheese-laden main course which disappeared quickly. It was really a prelude to the main event and he gave a 10/10 review for the chocolate fudge brownie ice cream topped with mini marshmallows and churros bites with Nutella dipping sauce that we shared. Our toddler chewed on chunks of garlic bread and ate individual bits of macaroni cheese before trying a couple of spoonfuls of ice cream. Battered fish goujons, grilled chicken with mashed potato and spaghetti with tomato sauce are popular on the kids menu. Advertisement Advertisement After starters of bruschetta and mozzarella cubes, I had pepperoni pizza that reminded me of takeaways from here in my student days. It’s comfort food that arrives promptly, a quality that’s treasured when dining out with the whole family. My wife had pizza diavola with melted mozzarella, red chilli and smoked paprika chicken fillets. I hadn’t been back since I moved away from East Kilbride 20 years ago, not for any reason other than there were more convenient options when I lived in Dublin, Edinburgh, Dennistoun and Partick. The revamped restaurant has the added attraction of the dessert bar and has been kitted out to continue to cater to the next generation of EK families. It will continue to be a local favourite.",

        "content": "The Sensex crossed 76,000 mark for the first time and Nifty-50 also went past 23,100 mark in tandem led by rally in frontline stocks but in the last hour of trading benchmark indices fell sharply on profit taking. BSE’s benchmark index had hit the 75,000 mark last month on April 9. After climbing to 76,009 intra-day, the Sensex closed at 75,390.5 down by 19.89 points or 0.03 per cent. The Nifty-50 index too made a new all time high of 23,110.8 but closed lower at 22,932.45 down by 24.65 points or 0.11 per cent. Foreign portfolio investors were net sellers of equities worth Rs.541.22 crore while domestic institutions were net buyers by Rs.922.60 crore. “The bulls are facing stiff resistance at 23,000 levels as investors start booking profit at higher levels to avoid any knee jerk reaction in the market ahead of the election result. Better earnings growth, the expectation of a revival in private capex, and a moderation in FIIs selling intensity are the key positive triggers in the market,” said Vinod Nair, head-Research, Geojit Financial Services. Broader market closed mixed as the BSE Mid-cap index gained 0.63 per cent while the BSE Small-cap index closed flat losing 0.09 per cent. Volatility index NSE’s India VIX climbed 6.82 per cent to 23.19 and made a high of 26.20 intra-day which seem to have led to caution among the market participants. BSE’s IT (0.48 per cent), bank (0.63 per cent) and realty (0.76 per cent) sector indices gained while metal (-0.39 per cent) and power (0.49 per cent) were losers while all other sectoral indices closed flat. Stronger rupee at 83.13 per US dollar and Brent crude oil futures also in $81-82 per barrel range are providing strength to the Indian market as the selling by the foreign portfolio investors have moderated. Further Indian Meteoro-logical Department’s May 27 update on Monsoon rains said, “Quantitative-ly, the southwest monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be above normal rainfall.” Market is likely to cheer IMD update despite election outcome related short term volatility that is likely to prevail till June 4 this year.",

        "content": "During the peak of the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, the health-care system's capacity was stretched and hospitals across Canada relied on each other to share resources and provide care. Experts from London Health Sciences Center (LHSC), Ivey Business School and King's University College developed a simulation model to help hospital leaders make decisions on resources and capacity , ensuring LHSC was ready to accept patient transfers from outside the hospital's catchment area, including Toronto and Manitoba. To enable the most efficient use of resources during a crucial time, LHSC leaders needed a solution. \"The tool allowed us to maintain optimal care for all LHSC units by making decisions grounded in real-time data ,\" said Tim Rice, senior director at LHSC's Victoria Hospital. The pandemic required collaboration across the health-care system to ensure hospital capacities were balanced while maintaining the ability to care for non-COVID patients. In addition to strategies like having field hospitals at the ready, patient transfers between hospitals were critical to managing the pandemic response. Hospital leadership partnered with researchers from Ivey Business School and King's University College, building on previous collaborations, to create the model. They developed a Monte Carlo simulation tool designed to predict whether the hospital would be over capacity when responding to COVID-19 related impacts, such as changes in hospital admission rates , managing the impact of outbreaks and balancing the pandemic response with planned hospital activity. The work was published in the open-access journal BMC Public Health . The tool, created in Excel so any hospital could use it, helped forecast the usage of critical care and medicine unit beds over a one-week period. It was based on data from the previous week, including admission rate and average length of stay for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The spreadsheet-based simulation tool also factored in assumptions about future arrivals of patients from outside the region to predict capacity needs and whether additional beds dedicated for COVID-19 patients would be required. \"By inputting this data into the model, the impact to overall hospital bed capacity was better understood and provided LHSC leaders the information they needed to make objective decisions, including the resources required to meet the ongoing demands of the pandemic,\" Rice said. When Manitoba hospitals required support from LHSC, at a time when the hospital was already supporting both the London region and fielding requests from Toronto, the team was prepared and confident to make key decisions on how many patients LHSC had the capacity to accept from other hospitals and how to most effectively use hospital resources. \"The tool serves as a future resource for emergency preparedness and new iterations of the model are in development to help with ongoing capacity planning,\" Rice said. \"It is our hope that the legacy of this partnership will live on in the future work it supports.\" More information: Mehmet A.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal plans to retire after the 2024 season, but he said he may play the French Open again after losing in the first round Sunday.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “If it’s the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honor. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.”",

On Friday, the sheriff's office said the loose primate was on Mallard Street in Walterboro, South Carolina. They said the owner was attempting to capture it and had called in for assistance on Friday. \"Animal Control and the Sheriff's Office have received numerous tips as to Bradley's location, but because of the attention this situation has caused on social media and news channels, people who are trying to get a look at Bradley are sadly hampering the owner's efforts to catch him,\" said CCAS Director, Laura Clark. \"Professionals have been hired to help bring him home and our animal control team is assisting with attempts as well to return him to the safety of his habitat.\" On Monday, Colleton County Animal Services announced that Bradley the monkey had been found safe.",

        "description": "Authorities continue to ask for help in gathering any information about what may have happened to Carla Beth Anderson, who disappeared in 1987",
        "content": "WADENA, Minn. — On the night of Friday the 13th in November 1987, deer hunters were gearing up for the opening weekend, a fire burned in a swamp on the edge of town, an unremarkable brown car was stolen and the employee of the month at the local Hardee's vanished without a trace. Those events are either coincidental, or the keys to solving a three-decadee mystery that has yielded many theories and tips, but no answers. Despite countless leads, sightings, psychic visions and rumors, Carla Beth Anderson, who became the subject of an intensive search in the Wadena, Minnesota area, has never been found. Local authorities, though several generations have now held the case in their hands, continue to say the case is at the forefront of their minds. Carla is a white female who was just 23 at the time of her disappearance. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a half inch scar above her right eye. She was petite, just under 5 foot tall and just 80 pounds. Last seen, she was wearing a brown and orange Hardee’s jacket, a white Pepsi and Mountain Dew sweatshirt with three bears on it, blue jeans and pink sneakers. Carla was mildly mentally disabled. Carla was well liked by her Hardee’s manager at the time, Wayne Wolden, who went on to become the mayor of Wadena. \"She was a fantastic employee. Wonderful personality, lighthearted, smiling a lot,\" Wolden said in a previous interview. \"I used to call her 'spud' because she was like a little potato ... She was probably 4-foot-10 inches tall, maybe, on a good day, on heels.\" He added that she was kind and hard working. She was known to volunteer to come work at her job on days she wasn’t assigned to work. She had an innocence about her that makes this case even more disheartening. The sweet memories of the girl remain as current investigators continue to search for her. Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job, her own home and a boyfriend. Anderson lived at Greenwood Apartments in Wadena, just a couple blocks from her place of work, so she was able to walk to work easily. She was expected to have her photo taken the following Monday for the Employee of the Month display. It was one of many things that would go unfulfilled with her disappearance. Looking back at that Friday, Nov. 13, Anderson just found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at Taco John's that evening to celebrate the honor. After dinner, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments. Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR. Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift on Saturday, Nov. 14, which was uncharacteristic of her, as she was known as an exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing were her keys and her light jacket, with the Hardee’s logo on it. Her purse remained on the table. The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in. On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window, according to the investigator at the time, Lane Waldahl. Waldahl has his suspicions about who started the fire that night, but no evidence. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however. That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case but many believe this to be too much of a coincidence. “They’ve got to be related, but we just can’t prove or disprove it, yet,” Wadena Chief of Police Naomi Plautz said. “The one thing that has always stuck with me, that vehicle has never been located,” Wadena County Sheriff Michael Carr Jr. said. “If you were to find that vehicle, you would probably find her.” Carr remembers Carla going missing while he was a sophomore in high school. \"Still in the back of my mind there is a connection between that car and Carla,\" Waldahl said. They searched for the car across the region and combed other states. Wadena Sgt. Brandon Pearson reflected on all the stolen vehicles that they deal with now. Eventually they are found. But decades later, this one has not been found. Waldahl suspects it's in a lake or buried in a gravel pit. Police searches, intense media coverage, state and federal investigations — nothing revealed what happened to Anderson. The police followed every tip. Four three ring binders are filled with the tips, the hunches and the interviews. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also has a copy of all the details. A search committee went out looking to find Carla about five days after she went missing. A WCCO helicopter was used to search from the air. The Civil Air Patrol lent their eyes from the skies. It was deer hunting weekend when Carla disappeared, and hunters were alerted to be on the lookout for the girl. Carr said authorities acted fast as the ground was bare at the time of her disappearance. They knew snow would soon arrive and cover up any disturbed ground. Within days of their searches, it did snow, Carr said. Waldahl said the combined efforts of local, regional, state and federal law enforcement agencies was impressive and he feels they left no stone unturned. Years later he recalls speaking again with BCA and FBI profilers interested in taking a fresh look at the cold case. That again turned up no solid evidence to follow. Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He apparently had a solid alibi putting him elsewhere that night. All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. They were given a polygraph test and passed. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but little evidence is available as to her fate. A psychic who said she knew where Carla was came to town but brought up another dead end. Anderson was placed on playing cards in 2008 among a list of the top 52 cold cases in the state. The card decks have been distributed to all 515 Minnesota police departments and sheriff offices, plus 75 county jail and annex facilities. In addition, over 10,000 decks have been supplied to Minnesota state prison inmates. While the cards have been effective in some of those cold cases, no solid tips in Carla's case have come from that effort. In the days after the disappearance, volunteers including the Wadena Pioneer Journal newspaper staff worked to create 5,000 posters with Carla Beth Anderson on them, pleading with people to call if they had seen her. The posters were plastered all over north and central Minnesota. They even made it to the Metrodome as the local Verndale Pirates football team were playing at the Prep Bowl. Much has changed over the last three decades The former Hardee's is a Burger King, the Taco John's location is a parking lot, and all the police working at the time of Anderson's disappearance have moved on, retired or died. Anderson’s parents died months apart in 2008: Verne Wells on Feb. 9, and Roberta Wells on June 3. What hasn't changed is a concerted effort to solve this bizarre case. “Anytime we get a lead or tip, we look into it,” Plautz said. There’s been about a half dozen tips in Plautz’ 23 years working in Wadena. They continue to search and most of all are looking for honesty from those involved. “We’re still diligently working on it, she has not been forgotten,” Sgt. Pearson said. At this time, they are running down a tip which they believe may be valuable in finding Carla. “We’re still very much in investigation mode.” The police department puts out a reminder of the disappearance every November hoping someone will talk. They know that someone knows. “The reminders ... it just gets people talking,” Plautz said. “If someone is just too afraid to say something, maybe the next year they’ll get enough courage to say something.” “The guilty conscience weighs heavily on people as the years go on,” Pearson said. “We’re hoping to appeal to that, to anyone who knows something,” Plautz said. Plautz promises anonymity for those looking to share information. Police say Carla has extended family in the Brainerd area that would very much like to see this resolved. Anyone that knew Carla would like to see her found. The community of Wadena has been hanging on to hope. “It’s one of Minnesota’s most predominant cold cases just because of how she vanished and was never heard of again,” Pearson said. Plautz shared one difference with this cold case is that Anderson was such an innocent girl. “The most innocent among us, and to not be able to come up with the answers that everybody wants ...” Pearson said, talking about the difficult case. Carla was that picture of innocence. Her child-like 23-year-old face is one the community cannot forget. Waldahl, who had just been named investigator about two months before this all began, regrets that he was unable to solve the case while Carla’s parents were still alive. He continued the search until his retirement in 2002. Beyond that, he keeps an interest in the case and still gets people asking him if he followed this lead or that. \"It's never gone away. It's always there,\" Waldahl said. \"I hope someone finds her before I go.\" Details about Anderson's case are posted to various missing person sites including: The Wadena Police Department is the investigating agency. If you know any additional information or can provide tips regarding Anderson contact the Wadena Police Department at 218-631-7700. The BCA can be contacted at 1-877-996-6222, email bca.coldcase@state.mn.us, or submit information via the tip form (can be done anonymously).",

        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week’s election is turning his support to the man, , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a . That MK party, named after the ANC’s old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans’ support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn’t blunted Zuma’s influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the for Africa’s most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa’s presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma’s credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week’s Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn’t allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma’s new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping His party’s branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC’s irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK’s last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,” said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: Farai Mutsaka, The Associated Press",

        "content": "TEHRAN, May 27: Iran’s acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country’s new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week’s helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran’s new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi’s time in office, noting that Iran’s crude oil production- a key source of hard currency for the country – climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the U.S.’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen’s Houthi rebels as Israel’s war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Analysts have suggested that Mokhber could be one of those to register. Meanwhile, on Monday marked the first day for Iran’s newly elected parliament, following a March election that saw the country’s lowest turnout since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Of those elected to the 290-seat body, hard-liners hold over 230 seats, according to an Associated Press survey. Iran’s parliament plays a secondary role in governing the country, though it can intensify pressure on a presidential administration when deciding on the annual budget and other important bills. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, has the final say in all important state matters. (AP)",

        "content": "The Bombay High Court on Monday asked CIDCO to stall its move to remove the hoarding concerned and instead suggested they come up with a policy or regime for hoardings located within their jurisdiction or area. The court was hearing a plea by advertisement agencies challenging the notices issued by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to remove alleged illegal hoardings in Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (NAINA). A vacation bench of Justices NR Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan also remarked that civic authorities said nothing to the advertising firms until the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse incident. Firms including Devangi Outdoor Advertising and Harmesh Dilip Tanna, proprietor of Gargee Graphics, had approached the High Court stating that CIDCO did not have the jurisdiction to send such notices. The petitioners claimed they had erected the hoardings legally after obtaining necessary permissions from authorities. Advertisement Despite this, they said they have received notices for removal of hoardings within 24 hours or face action under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP). As per petitioners, the authorities have warned them that if hoardings were not removed, they would dismantle them and recover costs from the owner. The notices by CIDCO come in wake of the collapse of a hoarding on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13, which killed 17 people. CIDCO purportedly issued notices to several hoarding owners after the unfortunate incident. Advocate for the petitioner firms, Mohsin Khan, argued that the notices were issued without a show-cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. Khan also claimed that authorities failed to verify the structural stability of the hoardings before issuing the notice, hence the action amounted to being arbitrary and ex-facie illegal. However, CIDCO’s lawyer submitted that the authority had issued notices to several owners of hoardings after discovering they had been installed without requisite permissions. The lawyer claimed that the same exercise was crucial as it was within the Navi Mumbai airport region. The corporation also claimed that the hoardings erected since 2018–19 had applied for permission in 2023, including those by the petitioners. Advertisement The bench sought to know if the authority had conducted any structural audit of all hoardings within its domain, and whether the authority was planning to bring a regime or policy in place for illegal hoardings within its area. These hoardings are not brought back to CIDCO, the bench said, and until the Ghatkopar incident, nobody said anything. In these circumstances, the bench asked if the corporation should at least not study whether the hoardings pose any danger, instead of bringing them down? “Have a reasonable policy view, otherwise case by case people will come. If you decide to demolish everything, that is also different. We are placing this on May 30. Till next date, if it is not pulled down, we are asking you to hold it,” the bench said.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "CARGOTEC CORPORATION, STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE, 27 MAY 2024 AT 9:30 PM EEST Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for Hiab business area and information on planned management for standalone Hiab Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for its Hiab business area and information on planned management for Cargotec as a standalone Hiab company ahead of the capital markets day, which will be held on 28 May 2024 starting at 2:30 pm (EEST). As announced earlier, Cargotec is carrying out a structure change where there would be three separate businesses emerging from the current Cargotec group. Kalmar is planned to be demerged to form a separate listed company as from 1 July 2024, and Cargotec is looking for a solution for MacGregor during 2024. If the planned actions are completed, current Cargotec would comprise of Hiab as a standalone business. Cargotec announced in conjunction with its January–March 2024 interim report that due to the high certainty of standalone listing of its business area Kalmar by means of a partial demerger, the combined financial targets set in November 2022 for Kalmar and Hiab are no longer valid. Therefore, separate long term targets have been set for Hiab and Kalmar. Kalmar’s new long term targets were published on 22 May 2024 when the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority approved the prospectus concerning the proposed partial demerger of Cargotec and listing of Kalmar’s class B shares. Cargotec’s Board of Directors has set the following financial targets for Hiab to measure success by 2028: Annual sales growth over seven percent over the cycle Comparable operating profit 18 percent (1 Return on capital employed over 25 percent (2 1) as business area of Cargotec 2) as business area of Cargotec, defined as (Operating profit / Operative capital employed) In addition to the Hiab-specific long term targets, Cargotec’s climate target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all three emission scopes by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline remains valid. The target is validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In its planned standalone future after the solution for MacGregor has been found, Cargotec (future Hiab) is planning to publish a new climate target and applying its validation from SBTi. Cargotec also aims for a growing dividend of 30–50 percent of EPS and to keep gearing below 50 percent. “Hiab has a strong track record of profitable growth. We aim to reach even higher with our new strategy, which our new targets demonstrate. We continue to shape the essential industries we serve with our innovative lifting and delivery solutions and increase customer’s productivity, safety and sustainability. Setting our own financial targets is also a major milestone on our journey to become a standalone company,” says Scott Phillips, President Hiab. If the planned demerger of Kalmar is completed and a solution to MacGregor is found so that MacGregor would not thereafter be part of the Cargotec group, Cargotec’s Board of Directors is planning to propose to Cargotec’s General Meeting of shareholders that the company’s name would be changed from Cargotec to Hiab. Should such actions be carried out as planned in the leadership of the current President and CEO of Cargotec, Casimir Lindholm has announced his intention to step down as President and CEO at such point. The Board of Directors would then appoint the President of the Hiab business Scott Phillips as the President and CEO of the renamed company being the current Cargotec. Cargotec currently estimates that these changes to transform into standalone Hiab could take place during 2025. Current Cargotec CFO Mikko Puolakka would continue as CFO of standalone Hiab. More detailed information on the new financial targets will be provided at the Capital Markets Day which can be followed online at https://cargotec.videosync.fi/hiab-cmd-2024 , starting at 2:30 pm (EEST) on 28 May 2024. Questions can be submitted during the presentations. The presentation material will be available at Cargotec’s website www.cargotec.com/cmd24 .

        "description": "On social media platforms like TikTok, rumors are circulating that are causing fear around hormone therapies, such as the birth control pill, leading many women to reject these types of treatments",
        "content": "Eva Millet Experts are increasingly detecting women who reject hormonal contraceptives out of fear of alleged side effects. Misinformation on social media reinforces the notion that hormones are not natural and, in fact, harmful. This new phobia is also present among women who, during menopause, refuse hormone replacement therapy. The day a patient of Isabel Silva told her that she didn't want to take the contraceptive pill “because she was afraid that, by taking it, she would like 'less manly men'”, this gynecologist knew it was time to do something. “When I asked her what she meant by 'less manly men', she said she didn't know, but that she had heard it on TikTok...”, she recalls. It wasn't the first time that, in her practice, this social network was used as a source of information to reject hormonal contraception: such misinformation is becoming increasingly common on social media. This specialist explains how, through the internet, a discourse of fear and distrust has been built around hormonal contraceptives. This discourse has resonated among younger women, who seek information through social media. From the fear of “less manly men” to the appearance of body hair, weight gain, loss of libido, or the fear of infertility, misinformation about hormonal contraception spreads freely. “We live in a world where influencers have a lot of power and little information, and indeed, people without any kind of training make all kinds of assertions. It is a phenomenon that we have been observing among our colleagues,” notes the doctor, who works in the Sexual and Reproductive Health Unit in Villena, Alicante. Silva is also the vice president of the Spanish Contraception Society, which organized its annual congress last March. It was the seventeenth one, but the first to have a session dedicated to 'Hormonophobia': the fear of hormones. A phenomenon that, as the speakers concluded, is on the rise. “There are many influencers without qualifications, giving false information, offering profitable courses or products. The scientific societies are the target,” said Dr. Marian Obiol Saiz, a speaker on the panel. According to another participant, Dr. María Ángeles Gómez Martínez: “It's easier to scare than to remove the fear; the internet can be a cause of much misinformation. This rejection of hormonal contraceptives is part of the concept of 'salutism', coined by R. Crawford, which refers to the pursuit of 'naturalness'.” And the idea that hormones are “not natural” accompanies these false myths circulating on the internet. Misinformation that, experts warn, represents an obstacle to effective and safe contraception. In order to avoid using contraceptives such as the pill, the patch, or the hormonal ring, Dr. Silva says, “Some resort to things that make no sense. Remedies that, they tell us, they saw on some social network... And then they end up pregnant and don't want that pregnancy. That is a personal drama and a failure for us.” Other young women turn to methods such as the copper IUD (intrauterine device), which not all can use at these ages. Others, Silva adds, use condoms: “Which, when used properly, is very effective, but we always talk about double protection, which is a shared responsibility.” Whatever the case, before using a hormonal contraceptive like the pill. This rejection, Silva adds, also has social repercussions: “Because the contraceptive pill, by separating sexuality from reproduction, was extremely important for women's equality: a milestone in the history of medicine and health.” In such an important matter as sexual and reproductive health, this specialist insists that: “It is essential to get well informed, by going to specific units or to your gynecologist.” Her appeal makes sense, considering that, according to data from the Spanish Contraception Society, 44.7% of young women do not visit a healthcare professional for these types of consultations. With good information, adds Dr. Silva, not only are those myths that are currently associated with the pill and hormones in general debunked, but information about their beneficial effects (“which are many”) is also provided, starting with the significant fact that it prevents unwanted pregnancy. In the face of doubts, she insists: “You should always seek information from a professional source, not a friend who will give you information from a social network. Perhaps we are a bit to blame for not being more present on social media, but it's just that we can't keep up,” reflects the gynecologist. But these myths not only exist among the younger ones: misinformation also occurs during the menopause stage, where hormones (or rather, their sharp drop) play a leading role. Menopause is a biological process in which the ovary stops releasing eggs and a lower amount of estrogen and progesterone is produced, leading to various consequences: from classic hot flashes to insomnia, through memory loss and even depression. Although menopause impacts the quality of life of millions of women, the option of hormone replacement therapy raises many concerns. In line with this, the internet is abuzz with influencers advising to seek 'natural' solutions to alleviate symptoms of something that they insist is 'natural'. The message is to buy a fan and endure before (heaven forbid!) ingesting hormones to offset its drastic loss. “Hormonophobia may not be detected as much in the menopause setting, but it also emerges,” explains Dr. Clotilde Vázquez Martínez, director of the Endocrinology and Nutrition Service at the Jiménez Díaz Foundation in Madrid. This specialist has also heard the phrase in her consultations: “I don't want anything that is not natural,” which she attributes to the boom of this 'naturalistic' trend, which is almost like a religion, linked to natural childbirth without epidural, with pain, believing that there will be more attachment if a woman suffers during childbirth, and that I find hard to understand, truly, because you see women shattered.\" In recent years, professionals have been observing a 'naturalistic' trend that rejects any type of hormonal treatment for menstrual pain and menopausal symptoms This fervor for 'the natural,' she explains, is also present in menopause, where, in addition, hormone replacement therapy has had a very bad reputation, as it was associated with breast cancer by some (“very poorly done,” says Vázquez), but highly publicized studies. All this generated a great deal of distrust that, the doctor explains, persists in Spain: unlike other European countries, here the percentage of women who resort to hormone replacement therapy does not even reach 20%. Therefore, when in 2021 Vázquez published his popular science book With Hormones and Wildly (Vergara), he dedicated many pages to counteracting this mistrust: “Which, he explains, is due to there being a lot of misinformation and two biased studies that have done a lot of harm. But I have read the fine print of all these studies and I assure you that hormone therapy neither prevents nor increases the risk of breast cancer.” In fact, he points out: “After the age of 50, women primarily die from heart attacks: and that risk does increase significantly due to the estrogen deficit that occurs in menopause.” What is neither natural nor healthy, according to this specialist, is to stop producing these key hormones so quickly. “Because beyond the acute discomforts that menopause causes you, what actually happens is that in the long term it conditions the rest of your life, which today has almost doubled.” Vázquez always explains in consultation that the ovary has a life span “between 13-15 and 50 years”; a period that, until not long ago, was the life expectancy of a woman. “So the problem used to be excessive fertility, but now it turns out that there are many years in which a woman will live with an organ that, since it no longer needs to procreate, no longer synthesizes those hormones.” In short, there is a mismatch between biology and vital needs. And she says that estrogen is essential to fill this gap and provide a good quality of life: “Women have estrogen receptors throughout the body. If we only had them in the breasts and ovaries, I would say, 'since you don't need to procreate anymore, you don't need more,' but the fact is that we have estrogen receptors in the brain, blood vessels, bones, skin, hair, collagen, eyes, liver, heart... throughout the body!” Therefore, the endocrinologist says: “Being without this hormone has systemic repercussions of all kinds: emotionally, in the brain —lack of concentration, memory loss, are symptoms that many women mention during this period—, at a vascular level...”. “The natural thing -she summarizes- is to continue having estrogen. Of course, not in the quantities needed to ovulate, but enough to keep the tissues in which that hormone plays a role healthy.” “We are walking hormones,” adds Dr. Silva. “People don't realize it, but that's how it is: we have insulin that regulates glucose, we have a thyroid hormone that regulates our thyroid, and when someone has a thyroid hormone deficiency, no one questions giving a hormone to regulate it. However, when we have a deficiency, as in menopause, some people question compensating for it... What needs to be considered is that with hormonal treatment, whether for contraception or for menopause, we, as professionals, are regulating it.” In the field of menopause, another ubiquitous message on social media is that it can be managed by changing lifestyle: intense exercise, diet, and vitamin supplements before resorting to hormone replacement therapy. Dr. Vázquez recognizes this trend, but is very clear that “it's the other way around: hormonal treatment must be accompanied by a lifestyle change. It would be - for example - like saying: ‘I have diabetes’ and being told: ‘What you have to do is not eat or eat very little and spend all day exercising, but don't use insulin’... It doesn't make sense!”. Clotilde Vázquez reiterates that: “We are hormone beings,” and as long as we are alive, we have to have hormones. “For this reason, when an organ ends its function prematurely, as in the case of the ovary, it is not unnatural to replace this function, quite the opposite.” She gives the example of presbyopia: “Which is also something 'natural,' but if you don't wear glasses, then life becomes complicated for you...”. Just as cataracts and many phenomena that occur over time are also “natural”: “But if you don't take care of them, with the number of years we have left to live, your quality of life is greatly diminished,” Vázquez points out. The endocrinologist concludes that what is natural is to live in health, and to live in health we need hormones. Anything that is not health is unnatural.",

        "content": "Who says a burger needs meat? Bengaluru-based food blogger Vijayalakshmi Vikram says plant-based patties can be just as juicy, flavourful, and satisfying as their classic counterparts. “In addition, they’re healthier and great for the environment. It’s a win-win,” she said, as she whipped up some vegan burger patties with Bangalore Times for International Burger Day. When making vegan burgers, mushrooms and beans, are an excellent alternative, she tells us. “Honestly, there are plant-based alternatives for almost anything these days, so as a vegan I never feel like I'm missing out on anything in life.” “Being vegan for over seven years is more than just a diet for me, it's a lifestyle choice built on kindness to animals and a commitment to living compassionately.” BLACK BEAN AND MUSHROOM BURGER WITH THE MAGIC OF PEANUTS RECIPE INGREDIENTS: For the patty (makes six): 400 gms button mushroom 3 large potatoes 100 gms panko bread crumbs 100 gms tofu 1 full cup cooked black bean or kidney beans 3 tbsp chilli flakes, 1 tbsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp each of onion and garlic powder, salt to taste For the spicy burger spread: 2 red capsicum 1 tbsp garlic powder 400 gms of peanut curds (hung) Salt to taste 1 tbsp chilli flakes Veggies for the burger: Lettuce Siced onions Cucumber Tomato Jalapenos METHOD Prep work for patty: Wash and clean 350-400 gms of button mushrooms.

        "content": "In “No Pain,” the third episode of season two, Armand (Assad Zaman) shares the story of the Theatre des Vampires as Louis (Jacob Anderson) expresses reluctance to join—something that doesn’t stop Claudia (Delainey Hayles) from eagerly wanting to be a part of it. This week we bite into the history of and Lestat’s (Sam Reid) role in its founding, as well as , dark gifts, and more immortal romance. Levan Akin directs “No Pain” from a script by Heather Bellson in Anne Rice’s Immortal Universe of vampire lore, airing Sundays on AMC and AMC+. Taking a break from the isolating room at Louis and Armand’s penthouse, Molloy (Eric Bogosian) gets a real meal at a posh sushi restaurant in Dubai. There he’s accosted by a man who goes by Raglan James (Justin Kirk), who represents another mysterious party tracking vampires that knows more than Molloy is being told by Louis and Armand. Book fans definitely geeked out a bit here at the character’s introduction and little foreshadowing lines from James thoughout (if you know you know). Molloy thinks he’s not exposed, but after James advises him to be open to communication, he ends up getting hacked by the mysterious figure anyway when he gets back into the penthouse. Talk about a poor firewall, friend! Daniel is immediately sent files of more vampire information that he ever imagined in relation to his interview subjects and himself. Molloy tries to play it cool and hide James’ helpful info dump via chat box, as Armand arrives before Louis to share an on-the-record history lesson about the Paris Coven’s origins. The soft-spoken Armand is very old, despite his perpetually angelic-looking appearance: in 1556, the Roman Coven he was a part of sent him to Paris to head up its enclave, which lived in squalor deep in the shadows underground. They were run by sects driven through ancient religious laws and gods to keep them in eternal damnation mode under Satan. It got old very quickly for Armand; by the 18th century, when Lestat began to run amok in the city above, flaunting his alluring menace on the unsuspecting living, it drove most of the Paris Coven crazy to see such heretical behavior. But it intrigued Armand. In order to exert dominance as the Paris Coven’s , Armand reveals himself to the fledgling Lestat and informs him he’s his new master as he exists in their domain and must follow vampire law. So of course Lestat blows him off, with the swish of his cape and his blond bouncy hair, because he does not want to be an obedient, poor, peasant vampire. The rejection only makes the brat Frenchman more hot to Armand, who’s never faced a challenge. Naturally, the coven wants severe punishment for Lestat as they see him break so many more rules including taking a mortal lover. That’s the breaks for letting Lestat run his showman lifestyle—and Armand uses his ancient powers to literally drop his ass and drag him into cooperating with a show of power that switches Lestat’s view on Armand. The boy wants power and he immediately plans to get it, so he shows up to the coven’s hovel with Christ on a cross (literally) to dismantle the old ways, which is what Armand wanted but knew he couldn’t get away with. He pisses on their rules and old god worship, because to Lestat they’re not there to stop them from being gods themselves. The coven breaks loose into the night; some end up taking to the sun to escape meaningless existence, while others jump into power. Knowing they need to be reeled in, because careless killing endangers all of them, Lestat encourages Armand to begin the coven anew through the Theatre des Vampires, a show where they perform their true identity and take their prey while the living laugh at the fiction they think they’re seeing. Lestat’s reformation leads to a new age of the vampire, giving Armand the freedom he sought, and he tells Lestat he loves him while Lestat being Lestat only covets Armand’s dark gifts. As soon as he learns them from the , Lestat abandons him and the coven but leaves them the means to continue without him. Lestat’s ghosting and lover melodrama is something Louis is aware of and helps provide insight on when he sits with Armand and Molloy. It would take Armand 150 years to tell someone else he loved them, and you can deduce it’s Louis—oh, the piping hot tea! Molloy resumes Claudia’s Paris diaries, as she campaigns to join the coven that Louis wants no part of except to see her happy (and also he’s sweet on its ). She takes on the tasks of cleaning the theater house as she learns more about the coven, particularly Santiago. The acting troupe’s lead inspires her with his performances and dark gift of making people accept death before killing, and with her Daddy Lestat’s ambitious streak, she wants that power too. So Santiago takes her under his wing because he was also orphaned by a terrible maker, but of course he doesn’t know hers was Lestat—just some rando vamp named “Bruce.” Lestat’s presence is also felt in Louis’ motivations; like his former lover, there’s an independent streak that prevents him from having any interest in the coven, and that makes him attractive to Armand. The Paris Coven resents that even though all Louis does is enjoy Parisian culture and take up photography, with sporadic human meals, Armand begins to join him on his late-night wandering throughout the city. They fall in love over discourse about good vs. evil and enjoying music at jazz clubs—even with the occasional mental projection of Lestat showing up in Louis’ mind. Last season’s “Come to Me” song reappears in a fun scene as a diss track with Lestat on piano singing to Louis, “You little whore, you only want him because you’re feeling blue,” which disrupts the romantic evening—and Armand reveals he knows his maker is Lestat. Foolishly, Louis tells Armand everything and the reprimands him over breaking so many rules he needs to enforce punishments for. Honestly, the expectation that Lestat would even teach Louis any rules is ridiculous, so when he says Lestat told him “shit” the frustration is understandable. Thankfully, Armand is stupidly sprung on Louis too, so he doesn’t kill him or Claudia immediately as was probably expected. Louis, of course, does not tell Claudia that his new boyfriend knows the truth; he continues to build a fake story around their history with “Bruce” and bond with her over their shared Lestat trauma. It really mirrors the complex PTSD that survivors of emotional and physical abuse can carry on from loved ones—even after making it out of the situation, it can haunt you, and in Louis’ case this presents as that manifestation of Lestat always following him. In anger, Louis kills a random person imagining them as Lestat and carelessly leaves the body behind. Within the coven, Santiago points out that his own maker was killed for less. Tensions begin to rise as the coven wants Louis dealt with, even as they embrace Claudia. As they begin to induct her into the coven by reciting the rules every vampire should follow (not knowing she’s broken a few of them), Armand takes Louis through the sewers to finally kill him. Louis is ready for it and asks for Armand to take care of Claudia, but the reveals her being in such a young body will break her in time. Louis doesn’t accept that and begs for the coven to give her a chance, but Armand insists he’s seen it before; over the centuries, vampires in children’s bodies are not able to evolve past their physical limitations. Louis defends her, insisting she’s strong and it wouldn’t break her—perhaps blinded by her love for her. Seeing the damage Lestat has caused, Armand asks if Lestat broke him and Louis says no, but he carries him. The trauma bonding brings them together as do the life and death stakes here. The tension is too much and they kiss, starting a tryst and avoiding all the punishment talk for now. airs Sundays on AMC and AMC+.",

Transcript Oscar Pulido: Welcome to The Bid, where we break down what's happening in the markets and explore the forces changing the economy and finance. I'm Oscar Pulido. The world remains a buzz over artificial intelligence, but rapid advancement and adoption of the technology is poised to drive a significant increase in power, demand, and this demand could redefine energy consumption as we know it today, we ask the critical question. Is the energy sector equipped for the AI power revolution? Today I'm joined by Will Sue from BlackRock's Fundamental Equities team. Will is one of BlackRock's leading voices on all things energy. He'll walk us through the sector's pivotal role in the build out and future of AI, as well as dig into the potential investment opportunities and challenges Will, thank you for joining us on The Bid. Will Su: Thank you, Oscar. Great to be here. Oscar Pulido: So, Will, we've talked about artificial intelligence on the podcast a lot, and it seems like there's no limits to the growth of this technology except the fact that it consumes a lot of energy and maybe that's the constraint. Tell us a little bit about why AI consumes so much power. Will Su: The simple answer to that extremely complicated question is that information processing is energy, and we are processing more information today than we've ever thought of, even from just a few years ago. At its most fundamental level, computations are just moving electrons around a semiconductor chip, but when you multiply that very small electric current by trillions of calculations, the energy demand adds up very, very quickly. I think Rob Goldstein mentioned this the concept of AI is not really anything new. The MIT AI lab was started in the late 1950s, we did have a breakthrough moment in 2017 when a team of researchers wrote a paper about the transformer, which then became the architecture for today's large language models or LLMs. Now, these models are being trained on trillions of parameters and tokens that make them high quality, high capacity, and able to contextualize the questions that they're being asked. And just to give you an idea of how big the computational power we're talking about is here. ChatGPT4 was trained on about 70,000 Zetta flops of compute power. That's 70 trillion trillion operations per second. Mind bending numbers. And as that number grows over time, that's why we're seeing this recent interest in meeting the power demand of AI. Oscar Pulido: Did you say Zetta flops? 'Cause I'm going to need a glossary. I think as we talk more about artificial intelligence, it feels like the terminology is new to a lot of people. And when you talk about power and the quantity, help us understand like, how much are we talking about on a global scale? Will Su: So as anyone who tried to model this out can tell you it's very hard to have a lot of confidence for 10, 20 years down the road when you're looking at something with such exponential growth. That being said, we did build our own model because as they say, all models are wrong, but some are useful. In building this model, it's helped us understand what the key variables are and maybe how the shape of that future power demand might look like. And the punchline is, we think there could be up to 1000 terrawatt hours of incremental electricity demand for AI by 2030, and that would be about 3% of global electricity. And keep in mind that the internet today already consumes 2 to 3% of global electricity for things like data centers, networking transmissions and increasingly for blockchains. In aggregate you could see total internet demand, including AI, make up 6 to 7% of global electricity demand by 2030. Oscar Pulido: And how is the world going to manage that power demand because it's incremental on top of what is already the demand for power, right? Will Su: Right. I think we can first dig a little bit into what is driving that AI demand. There's really three roughly equal buckets in our 2030 outlook. One is for training. So that's the power that it takes to train these very large models. And again, just to give you an idea of the scale in 2022 Chat GPT-3 came out. It was trained on 175 billion parameters and 300 billion tokens. And the amount of energy it took to train could power about 90,000 US homes for a year. Now you fast forward to 2023 when Chat GPT-4 came out, that model was reportedly trained on 1.8 trillion parameters and 13 trillion tokens. And the energy it took to train that could power 2.5 million U.S. homes for a year, and these models are getting bigger by the day. And the good news there is with each generation of semiconductors, each generation becomes about 50% more power efficient. So, it takes half the amount of power for one calculation. It's not enough to offset just how quickly the models are getting bigger, and then remember, more players are entering this game, globally, not just in the US but also in Europe and Asia. So, you add it all together and training really represents the bulk of the power growth that we see for AI in the coming few years. The second bucket for demand is something called querying. So that's when consumers, businesses, and other computers start to ask questions to these trained large language models. And in our model, we think you could see up to 30 billion AI queries per day by 2030. For comparison today, we make about 10 billion internet searches per day. But you have to remember that not all queries are created equally, right? A text-based query takes about the same amount of power as an internet search, but an AI generated photo takes up to 30 times more power, and a 60 second AI generated video takes up to 7,000 times more power than a text query. And video is big, it's 57% of all internet traffic today. So how the consumer adapts to AI video is really one of the key variables that'll determine just how much energy we're going to require to power AI. And then the third bucket is really for data center operations, mainly for cooling, because when you're doing trillions of calculations per second, these chips run really hot. So yes, 1000 terrawatt hours by 2030. That is a big number. I think it's a challenging task to meet that demand, but not an impossible one. Oscar Pulido: And maybe you can expand there because you shared a lot of numbers. you said the word trillions a couple times. the percentage increases that you've cited, particularly when you talked about how we use artificial intelligence to query, was quite large. So, what role do renewables play in this energy demand? I'm thinking about things like wind solar, are they the major component or are there other, sources of energy that we're going to rely on? Will Su: So, renewables are by far the fastest growing source of power generation. In the last 20 years. They've gone from almost nothing to 13% of global power generation. And they will continue to grow at a very fast pace. Without a doubt, renewables are going to play a big part, in powering AI, but also in powering this overall theme of electrification of our energy systems. Now renewables have one really big drawback when it comes to powering AI, which is intermittency. Right? Let's zoom into the Ercot grid in Texas, which is the largest wind market and the second largest solar market in the U.S. So, it has a lot of renewables, and if you just zoom in on a typical day, the solar power tends to peak out between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM when the sun's shining. And the wind peaks when the wind speeds are the highest, which is usually from midnight to 7:00 AM when you wake up. Peak demand really happens in the hours of 8:00 PM to midnight. That's when people are at home relaxing, watching TV, streaming, checking their social media. And you'll see that during that period, natural gas demand really increases to meet that gap that can't be met by wind and solar. And this is probably a good time to talk about nuclear, which people don't think of a lot, but it's actually today the largest source of carbon free power generation. It makes up about 9% of global power. But I think as governments around the world start to realize how much electricity growth there's going to be, there's starting to be a change in thinking. And in countries like South Korea, Japan, Italy, and here in the U.S. you're seeing regulators extending previously planned shutdowns of nuclear plans, and even in some cases, allowing them to restart after they've already been shut. So definitely don't count nuclear out in this low carbon way to power AI going forward. Oscar Pulido: So, it sounds like the, the demand is so significant that it is causing even some sources of energy that in the past that felt like, were becoming less of a priority to reenter the focus. Ultimately what you've said is there's a lot of different sources of energy that are going to help, power the AI demand. You mentioned nuclear gas, but also renewables. And if I could focus you on the US for just a second, artificial intelligence is not just the US topic, but it is the part of the world where the build out is really gaining a lot of momentum and therefore, how is the U.S. thinking about the power supply for artificial intelligence? Will Su: we really should talk about one of the biggest unsung triumphs in the energy transition so far, which is the U.S. Power grid has decarbonized itself by a third. Over the last 20 years, and about 60% of that came in the form of cheap and abundant natural gas as a result of the shale revolution that allowed us to substitute out much more polluting coal. You saw a coal share in the last 20 years drop from 50% to 16%. Natural gas went up from 19% of U.S. Power generation to 42. The other 60, the other 40% came from renewables. So, renewables, again, grew from almost nothing 20 years ago to 14% of the US power grid today. So, there's already a really strong track record of partnerships between natural gas and renewables to combine and help us decarbonize. Now, when you think about AI, and you think about data centers. The U.S. has about one third of the total data center capacity in the world, and I'm very confident that share will grow over time because we have the leading technology companies that are leading this AI revolution. And then we are also blessed with abundant resources, both traditional and renewable. If you look at a map of where these data centers are located in the U.S., you'll see that they're mostly in these big clusters that are located close to population centers. So almost half of all data centers in the U.S. are in Virginia. They're almost all in this six square mile tiny area called Data Center Alley near Arlington. There's other big clusters like Hillsborough, near Portland, Oregon. there's also growing clusters around Ohio, and you'll see a problem if you juxtapose that map onto one where the renewable resources are best in this country. The source of greatest solar radiation is in the southwest U.S., so that's places like Southern California, Nevada, New Mexico, and where the wind speeds are the highest are down the middle of the U.S. In the windy corridor that goes from the Dakotas down to Northern Texas. And they don't really overlap with where the data centers are located today and where the most growth is likely to happen in the coming years. And then to make matters worse, this country's really falling behind in making long distance transmission investments. We're making one eighth the mileage of new transmission lines than we did 10 years ago. That's a result of a number of regulatory and economic challenges with interstate infrastructure, and this is where natural gas is going to come in. It's a proven, mature technology. It's much cleaner than coal. It plugs easily into different grids, so it shapes my view that I think at least half, if not more of the incremental power for AI in the U.S. will come from natural gas and the balance will mostly be met by new renewable developments. Oscar Pulido: Data Center Alley doesn't sound as glamorous as like Silicon Valley, but it seems like it's also very important. Let's come back to your role as an investor. You spend your day thinking about companies to invest in, and if you follow the markets over the last couple years, it's been all about technology. But we're having a discussion about the energy space, and so presumably that means there's investment opportunities in the energy sector. Where are those? Will Su: Absolutely. So, as a value minded income investor, I have thought for a long time that energy is an undervalued sector because the market under appreciates both the volume and the duration for which the world needs oil and gas for the decades to come. And I think this recent focus on how do we power AI just shines yet another spotlight on how power hungry our world really is. And over time, I think that will help this sector rerate higher. Now, aside from that, I think the energy sector actually might be one of the most underappreciated beneficiaries for all the technological gangs that'll come with better generative AI. Some of the world's largest supercomputers are actually owned by large energy companies. Why? Because they perform a number of very computationally intensive tasks. Things like asset optimization, algorithmic trading, four D seismic imaging for new resource discoveries. And I'll give you one specific example, which is the industry is using more and more of what's called a digital twin. So, this is like a virtual replica of a real-world asset, something like a refinery or an offshore platform. It's just got so much data inside of it that you can do a lot of really interesting and exciting things. Things like predictive maintenance, fixing things before they break, things like stress, testing them for severe weather events or identifying methane leaks and reducing emissions that way. So, I think there's more than one way to win with energy when it comes to the theme of AI that's greatly underappreciated by the market today. I think the other sector that deserves some airtime here is utilities. So, utilities are a yield driven high dividend paying sector that's been somewhat out of favor in the last few years in a rising rate environment. But as the U.S. Grid goes from not having much growth for the last 20 years to needing to grow one to 2% per year going forward, there's a big opportunity for these utilities. It'll come after an initial period of heavy investments now, which utilities will win depends very strongly on what regulatory regime and what geography they operate in. Oscar Pulido: And it's interesting just to hear you talk about energy and utilities. I'm reminded we spoke to your colleague Carrie King, who reminded us that while it has been a very tech-driven market, in the last couple of years, there are opportunities that are starting to appear. And you're zooming in on the energy and utility sector as a function of artificial intelligence and power demand. But for an investor who is looking at this space, what should they be considering as they think about investing? Will Su: The energy sector contributes about 10% of the S&P 500's net income, but it makes up less than 4% of the index by market cap. And I think that valuation disconnect is driven by this persistent, and in my view, misplaced fear that this sector has no long-term growth. Because I think as we sit here talking about breakthrough technologies like generative AI, it is important for us to remember that there's many different poles for incremental energy demand in this world, and all or nothing approach to energy just isn't going to work. We have to find ways to help the traditional energy sources become cleaner and more responsibly sourced. At the same time, we scale up our renewables portfolio together, and only together will they be able to power the world forward in a pragmatic energy transition. Oscar Pulido: Right, the world is evolving, where the demand for energy will come from is changing. With the number of statistics that you've been able to cite about the energy sector and artificial intelligence, where does this passion come from? How did you get interested in this space? Will Su: Oscar, I'm having flashbacks to 16 years ago when I started my career at a large investment bank in the equity research department, and my recruiter said, you can either join the internet team or the energy team. And I had no hesitation. I said, energy, it's supply-demand driven. It's quantitative. The world needs this stuff. And you fast forward to today, and I think the internet index has outperformed energy by about 1,100%. But if you gave me a time machine to go back, I will make the same choice over again. This job has taken me to really exciting places all over the world. Offshore Norway, the Permian Basin in Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, or deep into the Amazon jungle in Guyana. That's a country that's going to go from the second poorest in South America to having the same GDP per capita as Brazil in less than a decade because of their resource development. So, it's been a really thrilling ride so far, and I look forward to more of what's to come. Oscar Pulido: We're glad you made that decision 16 years ago and that you would make it again, if you went back in time.

        "description": "President Biden recently raised taxes on American consumers and businesses and may have hastened the end of the dollar’s world reserve currency status.",
        "content": "President Biden recently raised taxes on American consumers and businesses and may have hastened the end of the dollar’s world reserve currency status. President Biden did this by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports. Specifically, President Biden raised tariffs on products including Chinese-produced steel and aluminum and many components imported from China for use in manufacturing electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs on Chinese-made semiconductors are rising from 25 to 50 percent while tariffs on Chinese-made electronic vehicles are rising from 25 percent to an astounding 100 percent. Of course, the costs of these tariffs will be borne by Americans wishing to purchase electric cars and American electric car manufacturers that use material imported from China. These new tariffs thus undercut Biden’s goal of getting more Americans to drive electric cars. The tariffs on Chinese goods give China even greater Inventive to challenge the dollar’s world reserve currency status. The same week Biden imposed these tariffs, China President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced they were strengthening their alliance in order to better challenge US military and economic hegemony. This is a reaction to US foreign policy of the post-Cold War era which has reversed the Richard Nixon-Henry Kissinger strategy of pursuing good relations with China. A part of the announcement recognized use of the Chinese yuan and Russian ruble for over 90 percent of the trade between the two countries. This is only the latest challenge to the dollar’s world reserve currency status. China’s share of the global economy has more than doubled in the last twenty years from 8.9 percent to 18.5 percent while the US share of the global economy has fallen from 20.1 percent to 15.5 percent. China’s rise is one reason why the US currency held by foreign central banks has dropped from over 70 percent in the early 2000s to under 60 percent today. Last year, China and Saudi Arabia agreed to expand their use of their own currencies in trade between the two countries. This is the first time the Saudis have agreed to use a currency other than the dollar for the oil trade since Henry Kissinger negotiated a deal where the Saudis would trade exclusively in dollars in return for US support for the Saudi regime. The “petrodollar” is a major reason why the dollar retained the world reserve currency status after President Nixon severed the last link between the dollar and gold.

It would also reduce other countries’ interest in purchasing US debt instruments. This would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt, creating more price inflation and leading to a major economic crisis. This will not just end the US military and financial empire abroad. It will also end the welfare state at home. Since both major presidential candidates and most Congress members are not serious about making the changes in foreign, domestic, and monetary policy necessary to avoid the crisis, America will likely face hard times in the near future. However, the end result may be a return to limited, constitutional government and a political class that realizes that Ronald Regan was correct when he told me that no nation has ever abandoned gold and remained great.

        "description": "Chinese regime is making efforts to strengthen relationships with Tokyo and Seoul as the two major trade partners move closer to Washington",
        "content": "China, Japan, and South Korea have agreed to increase cooperation, after leaders of the three Asian neighbors held their first summit in more than four years in Seoul. Speaking at a joint conference following the meeting, Mr. Yoon expressed his hope of swiftly resuming free trade agreement negotiations between the three countries, which have been suspended since 2019. Mr. Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral leaders’ meeting. In 2008, leaders of the three economies, which account for about a quarter of the world’s gross domestic product, agreed to convene a meeting annually. However, the meetings stalled after the last one in December 2019 in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the complex ties between the three countries. As for China’s side, Mr. Li said the regime wants to cooperate with South Korea and Japan in economic and technological areas, especially on supply chains and cutting-edge areas such as artificial intelligence. The summit was also overshadowed by the nuclear threat from North Korea. Just hours ahead of the three-way meetings, the regime led by Kim Jong Un notified Japan of its plan to fire a rocket to send a second military spy satellite into orbit. Against this backdrop, analysts signaled low expectations for any significant improvement in the relationship among the three Asian neighbors, despite Bejing’s efforts to bring Seoul and Tokyo closer. “China is seeking to mend diplomatic ties with South Korea and Japan, and the summit provides a good opportunity. However, the eventual results of the engagements will be heavily influenced by China’s overarching strategy,” Chen Ping-Kuei, an expert in international relationships at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, told The Epoch Times. Mr. Chen said he maintains a “pessimistic outlook” regarding the potential outcomes of the CCP’s diplomatic efforts, given that the Chinese premier still complained about the two countries’ expanding partnership with Washington while calling for cooperation. Meanwhile, there is little indication that Mr. Yoon and Mr. Kishida responded to Mr. Li’s calls, according to Chen Shih-min (not related to Chen Ping-Kuei), an international security expert at the National Taiwan University in Taipei. He believes it’s unsurprising that Japan and South Korea agreed to explore economic cooperation with China because all three countries are grappling with economic challenges. However, when it comes to crucial matters such as security and supply chains, both Tokyo and Seoul are expected to bolster their ties with Washington. “For Japan and South Korea, they will continue to prioritize and focus on enhancing their cooperation with the United States, and this trajectory, I believe, remains unchanged,” Mr. Chen Shih-min told The Epoch Times. Mr. Kishida also raised “serious concerns” about the situations in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and the South China Sea, according to a readout issued by Mr. Kishida’s office. Regarding Taiwan, Mr. Kishida told Mr. Li that Japan is “closely monitoring relevant developments, including military activities.”",

        "description": "The former former heavyweight champion was on flight from Miami to Los Angeles when the incident happened.",
        "content": "Mike Tyson is doing well after suffering a brief medical emergency mid-flight on Sunday. In a statement, per the 57-year-old boxer's rep, Tyson's medical incident stemmed from an ulcer flare up. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" the rep tells ET. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Tyson's rep clarified information that he flight was delayed due to his emergency. \"However, it’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the rep added. \"This two hour delay was due to air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" According to In Touch , who was the first to report the news, the former heavyweight champion became ill on a flight from Miami, Florida to Los Angeles, California. Approximately 30 minutes before landing, the outlet reports that passengers got a message asking if there were medical professionals onboard the plane. After arriving at LAX, paramedics helped the decorated athlete. Tyson is scheduled to get back in the ring in July for a heavyweight flight against social media star-turned boxer, Jake Paul. The event is scheduled to be held July 20 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Earlier this month, ET spoke to Tyson during a press conference who said he doesn't see Paul as a \"formidable opponent.\" When asked if he considers the 27-year-old a threat, Tyson didn't hold back. \"Anybody [is a] threat [when] there's two men in the ring, everybody's a threat,\" Tyson said. Tyson -- who will mark his return to the ring after 19 years -- also revealed what he told Paul ahead of the match. \"I don't think so, but we'll see,\" he stated when asked if he thinks Paul will pose a challenge. \"I gave him his warning: Fight like your life depends on it because it does. [But] I'm not concerned about anything. If I was concerned, I wouldn't be here talking to you.\" Tyson hasn't boxed publicly since his 2020 exhibition against fellow legend Roy Jones Jr. ended in a draw. The Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson heavyweight bout will be streamed globally by Netflix from an exhibition boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas on July 20.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Story continues below advertisement Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candour that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Story continues below advertisement Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Story continues below advertisement “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "Daley Blind is far from a household name, but at 34 years old he has been a driving force in Girona's first Champions League qualification. Alex Caparros/Getty Images On the penultimate weekend of the season, Deportivo Alaves played Getafe on Saturday night while everyone else played on Sunday. Why? Because they could. In the final two rounds, LaLiga schedules all the games that have anything riding on them at the same time on the same day, an act of competitive integrity designed to ensure that no one with objectives to fulfil or their life on the line has an unfair advantage or disadvantage. Only those with nothing to play for are put on different days. In week 37, that meant Alaves, and that meant a lot. In fact, them playing there, Mendizorroza packed but unnoticed by the rest, was almost the perfect portrait of the perfect season. Perfect?! Yep, pretty much. Irrelevance might not sound very exciting, but this is massive. Midtable mediocrity? That's not mediocre at all, not here. And the fact that few have talked about Alaves? Well, that's a good thing: a reflection of a lack of drama, just a job very well done. That they could get here safe with weeks to spare is a success. The lack of the epic kind of storylines that occupy everyone -- from managerial changes to desperate fights for survival, from wild swings in form to last-minute flukes, jeopardy or glory in every game -- gave Alaves a kind of anonymity. Justice, though, says that it is time to say their name. El Glorioso, their fans call them. - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.) They're not alone, either, so here's ESPN's guide to the unsung stars of the season -- some of whom you might not have heard much of, and no one could really blame you for that. It's time to give something back to those getting on with just being very good, a little love to LaLiga's best, pound for pound. THE CLUB: Alaves Alaves have Hagi, but not that one (Gheorghe). They have Simeone, but not that one (Diego) either. Instead, these are Ianis and Giuliano, the sons of illustrious footballers. And in Simeone's case, he spent much of the season injured, coming back just in time to help Alaves beat Atletico Madrid, which prompted their coach and his dad, Diego, to admiringly say: \"On the pitch, he has no mother or father.\" Alaves have the lowest budget in the whole league, their salary limit set at â¬31.28m, which is 10 times smaller than Atletico's. And 24 times smaller than Real Madrid's. More to the point, it is less than half the size of Granada's and Almeria's, both of whom went down. Alaves didn't, and it was clear pretty early that they weren't going to. The late loan signing of Samu Omorodion helped, but this was all of them, the work done by Luis GarcÃ­a and his players hugely impressive. Alaves are top in only one stat this season: penalties conceded. They're third in own goals and handballs committed. Not exactly beneficiaries of luck, then. But they do get a lot of crosses in -- only two teams have more -- and they have competed weekend after weekend. Except that they, more than anyone else, have repeatedly been dumped in the Monday and Friday slots no one wants. Until, as the end was close, they played on Saturday. Because they could, which was a lot more than many others could say. At the start of the season, Luis Garcia warned his players that unlike last year, when they came up from the second division, they were going to lose a lot of games, a new reality they would have to get used to and know how to manage. They did so superbly. And they won a lot of games too. Alaves have been fun, entertaining and free-wheeling all season long. Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty ImagesTHE COACH: Jagoba Arrasate, Osasuna There's also Luis Garcia, obviously, but, well ... that's covered by Alaves' team award. There's Ruben Baraja, the Valencia manager, who has surprised everyone and who put it neatly: \"Don't forget where we came from last year, how hard it was. This time we have achieved our objectives [survival] ahead of time. We would all like Valencia to be in a privileged position; I could want a Ferrari, but if I have to drive a Skoda.\" Javier Aguirre, the coach if not the character, possibly deserves a little more attention too ... and then there's Jagoba Arrasate. When he announced that he was stepping down as Osasuna manager, Arrasate said that he wanted to go at the right moment: he didn't want things to \"end badly\" -- \"I couldn't forgive myself,\" he insisted. As it turned out, this is a pretty flat end to the season, but that's at least in part because of how he has altered expectations in Pamplona. \"We haven't been able to continue what we did last year,\" he confessed, which said much. Yet Osasuna, who he took over in the second division, took to a Copa del Rey final and a European place, have secured their primera status very early for a fifth season in a row, despite having the fifth-smallest budget in Spain, and he departs with them in a good place, a job well done. Arrasate also departs having dignified football, one of the most genuine, least presumptuous men in the game. As a coach sometimes you suffer, but sometimes it's worthwhile. \"That beer just after a game [you win], when you say 'wow, how good was that?' is the best moment of the week,\" Arrasate says. Maybe at the end of week 38, the last game of the season and his final match after six superb years at Osasuna, he can have another. After all, Jagoba, you've earned it. Arrasate leaves Osasuna on great terms, having taken the minnows far on a shoestring budget. Irina R. Hipolito/Europa Press via Getty ImagesTHE SIGNING: Daley Blind, Girona OK, so Daley Blind isn't unknown, exactly. In fact, one of the measures of just how extraordinary this season has been for Girona is that for much of it they chased a league title when, if you go through their squad, their players had 37 relegations between them and only 14 league titles. And it's a bit of a push to truly include a lot of those titles: three for Eric GarcÃ­a, two at Manchester City when he played zero and six games, and one at Barcelona after which they decided they didn't want him anymore; one for Pablo Torre at Barcelona; one for Cristhian Stuani at Danubio some 20 years ago; one for Artem Dovbyk at Midtjylland; one for Savinho at Atletico Mineiro when he played only four games. As for Blind, he alone was responsible for more than half of them: seven at Ajax and one at Bayern. He had also played at Manchester United of course, and got over a hundred caps for the Netherlands. So, unknown? Nah, but largely overlooked this year? Yep. Blind came aged 34, having departed United five years earlier, seemingly coming toward the end, and wasn't wanted by Bayern anymore. As Girona flew, few really talked about him. There is a parallel here, by the way, to Girona midfielder IvÃ¡n MartÃ­n, who is a candidate for inclusion in this season's best unsung players. Instead, the focus fell on Aleix and Savinho and Dovbyk. Portu had his moment. Stuani has his status, a true superstar. Yan Couto flew. Eric Garcia had that redemptive narrative arc. But without Blind, it doesn't happen. Only four players in the entire league had more touches. And all that for free. THE PLAYERS There are plenty who deserve their moment. Diego Rico (on loan at Getafe from Real Sociedad), say. And Mika MÃ¡rmol at Las Palmas. Or Nemanja Maksimovic, playing all over the place at Getafe. Ante Budimir (Osasuna), certainly -- although it's hard to make a case for top scorers, quite honestly, even quiet ones like him. Or Gorka Guruzeta, and not so much for the goals as his role as the Basque Benzema, making better players of the other forwards at Athletic Club. But here are our three suggestions. LIVE ON ESPN+ (SELECTED GAMES) The beautiful game lives here. Stream top leagues, tournaments and teams. Sign up for ESPN+ SUNDAY, MAY 26 (all times ET) â¢ Getafe vs. Mallorca (7:50 a.m.) â¢ Leeds vs. Southampton (9:55 a.m.) â¢ Las Palmas vs. Alaves (10:05 a.m.) â¢ Celta Vigo vs. Valencia (10:05 a.m.) â¢ Sevilla vs. Barcelona (2:30 p.m.) MONDAY, MAY 27 (all times ET) â¢ Fortuna Dusseldorf vs. Bochum (2 p.m.) Ferland Mendy, Real Madrid No one has heard Ferland Mendy talk, and almost no one has heard anyone talk about him either. Even on the day of his unveiling, he spoke for barely 15 seconds. It takes some doing to be a Real Madrid player and be this anonymous, to go so unnoticed. Here, the gaze is so intense, the coverage so voluminous, that everyone gets talked about. Everyone gets their moment in the sun. Or, alternatively, kicked when they are down (which is a key point). Not Mendy. An example: one major newspaper in Spain has a search engine where you can look up articles by player names. When it comes to the French full-back, there is one piece about him in the past two years. He, it sometimes seems, is the meh in a megateam, the guy who's just not that good. But no one who is not that good plays for Real Madrid. Still less for this long, let alone constantly winning things. Not long ago, talking to Goal, Antonio RÃ1⁄4diger was asked to build his perfect player: this guy's speed, this guy's skill, this guy's technique, this guy's intelligence. When it came to strength, he said Mendy. If the answer was telling, the response to it was even more telling. \"Really?!\" his interviewer said, as if it was madness that anyone should even mention Mendy, let alone praise him. \"That guy is strong like ox, man,\" Rudiger insisted. Strong, silent and successful, too. And if that was a rare mention, if no one's talking about him, that's because he's not giving them reason to, which is also a good thing -- because as a defender that means errors as well. At Madrid, sure, being a left back tends to mean more and people tend to want more too: this is the place that had Roberto Carlos and Marcelo, that brought back flying Fran GarcÃ­a and is after Alphonso Davies. But there's Mendy still, appreciated by those who matter. \"Ferland is the best defensive defender in the world,\" Carlo Ancelotti said. play1:29How Real Madrid's mentality won them LaLiga Sebastian Salazar and Luis Garcia break down the reasons behind Real Madrid's dominance in winning their 36th LaLiga title. Ayoze PÃ©rez, Real Betis Isco has been man of the match so many times this season it sometimes seems like he's the only one playing. Real Betis teammate HÃ©ctor BellerÃ­n joked that he wins the awards even when he doesn't play, and, while he has been truly brilliant, a joy to watch, while he deserves the attention he has had, while he was worthy of many of the 18 MVPs he has taken and his redemption is one of the great stories of the season, there was something in that remark. Isco's dominance has served to obscure what others have done. Beyond the brilliant glow of the man they call \"Magic,\" there is talent, too. Just ask Isco himself, in fact: he's loving playing these days, and he's particularly loving playing with Ayoze Perez. The feeling is mutual. Watching these two in recent weeks, football is just better and so much fun. Watch Ayoze up close: keep an eye on the touch, the little darting runs, the positioning, and there's a technical quality and intelligence that sets him apart. There's also an ambition and a seriousness about his career: a commitment that is striking even in this hyper-professionalised world, a refusal to settle for what others accept, an analytical mind and that flash of anger when things don't come off. Which is less often now because above all, there's a decisiveness too -- and just when it mattered most. \"Fundamental,\" Manuel Pellegrini calls him. Ayoze has had to deal with a groin injury, but Betis' resurgence, heading toward a European place again, has had Ayoze as a central player. He has 11 goals and two assists this season and has scored five in his past five games. One of his celebrations has him drinking a nice cup of tea too, which will do for us. Pepelu, ValenciaPepelu is a playful, creative talent who has been one of Valencia's rare bright spots this season. Manuel Queimadelos/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images \"I don't feel like a traitor,\" Pepelu said in the summer. He had just joined Valencia from city rivals Levante, the club where he had spent his entire career, where he said he always dreamed of playing and where he had said he would continue even after they were relegated. Where, in fairness, he had continued, playing a season in segunda . He had come for â¬5.1m too, which is a lot of money for Valencia, the club that just doesn't spend money anymore. And there was attention and anger, all right -- even if Pepelu said he felt better because the transfer had been \"done the right way\" in a deal that was \"good for all three parties.\" So under the radar might not be the obvious description. Only, he has been. Jose Luis Garcia Vaya -- \"Pepelu\" to his pals -- came from the second division after all. And although he crossed the city, this is not a rivalry that dominates the media. The noise soon died down, and then came the actual season, which has been fantastic. But it has been quietly, undemonstratively so. It has come at a team that has not fought for survival this time, attention drawn to it, and that has never been much more than an outside bet for Europe either. That is underwhelming for a club like Valencia (in historic terms) but a success for a club like Valencia (as they are now), a lot of it down to him. Yet there has been no flash, just football. Ask them at Mestalla, and they know his level. Ask in Madrid or Barcelona or Seville or Bilbao, and it might be a push for many to know him at all. Sometimes the stats say it, so here are some stats: no outfield player in LaLiga has started more games (all bar one) or played more minutes (3,215) than Pepelu. He has played just short of 1,854 passes and had 2,432 interventions, which is more than Koke, Jude Bellingham, Frenkie de Jong, MartÃ­n Zubimendi, Mikel Merino or Dani Parejo. No one has made more recoveries than him. Only two have won more tackles. Only five have made more interceptions, and only six have created more chances. He has scored six goals, Valencia's second-top scorer. In a team built on academy kids -- whose extraordinary success story in saving them last season and their identification with the club now has brought deserved attention -- Pepelu has been the veteran, at 25 for goodness' sake, the man making sense of it all. \"A silent leader,\" Ruben Baraja said, when too few others have said anything at all.

        "content": "Monday's game between the Mets and the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers was postponed due to impending rain in New York. The game will be made up as part of a straight doubleheader at Citi Field on Tuesday, starting at 4:10 p.m. ET. The Mets had been scheduled to start Tylor Megill (0-2, 3.00 ERA) on Monday against fellow right-hander Gavin Stone (4-2, 3.60). The Dodgers announced they will send right-hander Tyler Glasnow (6-3, 3.09 ERA) to the mound in the first game of the doubleheader, while Stone pitches in the second game. The Mets (22-30) ended a five-game skid with a 4-3 win Sunday against the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers (33-22) are on a season-long five-game losing streak.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by International School of Advanced Studies (SISSA) Is artificial intelligence an unprecedented opportunity, or will it rob everyone of jobs and creativity? As we debate on social media (and perhaps use ChatGPT almost daily), generative AIs have also entered the arena of university communication. These tools—based on large language models that were optimized for interactive communication—can indeed support, expand, and innovate university communication offerings. Justus Henke has analyzed the situation of German realities about six months after the launch of ChatGPT 3. \"The research was conducted about a year ago when enthusiasm was high, but it was still early for people to understand the potential of the medium,\" he explains. This initial early monitoring showed that usage was already widespread at that point. Henke distributed a questionnaire to all press/communication offices of the country's universities, receiving 101 responses, about a third of the total. Practically all those who responded declared that they make some use of generative AIs. Translations, text corrections and text generation are the main uses recorded by Henke. The other functions suggested in the questionnaire—image creation, slide production, or document analysis—are instead marginal. \"What we observe in this initial work is that as far as communication is concerned, artificial intelligence is adopted by universities mainly to increase process efficiency, for example, to speed them up, doing more things in less time,\" explains Henke. What also emerges, especially in some open answers, is a certain caution and growing awareness towards ethical aspects. An example is data protection. \"For instance, one wonders whether it is wise, or right, to feed these intelligences—owned by private companies—with university data. The issue of privacy is also important,\" says the researcher. In this sense, \"more and more universities in Germany are releasing their own instances of generative AI chatbots, on dedicated servers,\" precisely to try to maintain control over these delicate aspects. \"There is not only a technological shift underway but also a cultural one,\" adds Henke. \"Usually the early adopters tend to be younger and fresher in the profession, more open to change.\" The problem highlighted, however, is that there is no policy that works for everyone. Many are also worried by the possibility that these technologies could replace jobs. \"You need the social aspect of technology adoption to be taken seriously,\" Henke says. Henke, who is now working on a new survey to assess the situation a year after the first, believes he will observe further evolution of the situation: \"I know that the use of generative AI tools is bound to increase,\" he says. \"Last year people were experimenting, but in the comments, they also explained that sometimes they were not satisfied with the results. It was probably a matter of competence. They didn't know, for example, how to make an effective prompt for their goals. \"Probably today this aspect will have improved. We have to now turn our head and focus on a more strategic and integrated AI approach,\" especially in light of the continuous updates and advancements of these tools (ChatGPT-4o was launched recently, sparking new controversies regarding security, even among the staff of Open AI, the company that owns Chat GPT). Henke believes it is important that universities learn to use these new instruments without calling into question the work they have done so far and the future goals they have already planned. \"Communication is about building relationships and trust. In particular, one of the main purposes of science communication (of which university communication is a particular case) serves to build trust and relationships between the public and scientific research. \"If you compromise these relationships using 'automated' press releases or mainly use bots to talk to the public, the latter will end up losing interest or worse, start having doubts about the institution itself. \"It's important that humans remain part of the process. Artificial intelligence should enhance communication, not replace it,\" says Henke. The findings are published in the Journal of Science Communication .

        "description": "Find out how to customize your Google Chrome homepage, startup page, and new tab page. Set a default homepage, change startup pages, activate the home button, and customize the new tab page with wallpapers and shortcuts.",
        "content": "A browser homepage is the website that appears when you open your browser and when you click the home button. Most browsers, including the popular Google Chrome, allow users to set up separate home pages. In Google Chrome 's default settings, there is no homepage. Instead, the browser opens a startup page, and you won’t see a home button next to the omnibox unless you adjust the settings. However, you can change the startup page in Chrome and set a default homepage. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Google Chrome has the same user interface on both Windows and Mac. Both Mac and Windows users can follow the same steps to change the startup page in Google Chrome: 1. Launch Google Chrome on the desktop 2. Click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 3. Select Settings from the drop-down menu. A new tab displaying the settings menu in Google Chrome will open. 4. Select On Startup from the left sidebar. 5. Choose the third option which says: “Open a specific page or set of pages” 6. Select add a new page. 7. Enter the URL for the desired startup page, then click “Add”. 8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more startup pages. This will help you to successfully change the pages that Google Chrome opens every time. When you close and reopen Chrome, each page you listed will open in a separate tab. Unlike the desktop version, the Android version of Google Chrome treats the homepage and the startup page as the same. Changing the homepage setting changes the website you visit by tapping the home button, and it changes the page that opens every time you launch the app. Here’s how to set it: 1. “Open Google Chrome” and tap the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 2. \"Select Settings\" from the drop-down menu. 3. Scroll down to \"Advanced settings\", then select \"Homepage\". 4. If the homepage button is turned off, tap it to turn it on. 5. Select \"Chrome's homepage\" or enter a custom web address. Select \"Enter custom web address\". This may be filled in with another web address. Either way, select the second option. 6. \"Type or paste the desired web address\" into the field. Your new custom homepage will load when you start the Chrome app or tap the home button.",

        "content": "EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Thursday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

The 52-year-old Pole, Mariusz Majewski, was detained by Congolese forces in February and later faced a military court in the restive nation, accused of spying. The allegations against him said that he had “approached the front line with Mobondo militiamen,” moved along the front line without authorization and “took photos of sensitive and strategic places and secretly observed military activities.” The Mobondo is a militia group that has been involved in intercommunal violence in southwestern Congo since 2022. Majewski was convicted last week and sentenced to life in prison. No details were released as to where he is held. Duda’s aide, Wojciech Kolarski, did not say what the outcome of the conversation between the two presidents was but stressed that the state had the obligation to take care of its citizens who find themselves in such dramatic situations overseas. Majewski’s family says he is in poor health and insists that he is just a traveler. Last week, Poland’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel Wronski said without elaborating that Majewski “is not a spy, he is a member of a travelers club” and was just following his “passion in life.” Wronski said it was due to a chain of coincidental circumstances and events that he found himself in Congo and his “behavior was the result of a lack of knowledge of local customs.” Polish authorities are aware of the “very difficult political situation in Congo” and a recent coup attempt there but expressed hope that Majewski will not be implicated in a situation he has no connection to. Poland does not have a diplomatic mission in Congo. Earlier this month, the and arrested the perpetrators, including some foreigners. Several those arrested. The Associated Press",

The latest is featured in WWE 2K24, which leads to a video on this website called ‘Remember.’ The video features flashes of several images, including a shack, a person, a bird, flies, before a message that reads: “Remember who you are.” The images continue from there, with a door opening, the person pointing to the side and at the camera, as well as art and various symbols. The person then removes their shroud but their face isn’t seen. According to one Twitter user, the number in the site’s URL (11_19) is the same that was featured on Bray Wyatt’s hat during a Firefly Funhouse episode with Alexa Bliss.

        "description": "‘Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,’ Israeli PM Netanyahu said on Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged on Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its tally. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” a US National Security Council spokesman said on Monday. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the spokesman said. 04:23 GEN-Z VS GENOCIDE: HOPE FOR HUMANITY? Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state”. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. “A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces following the shooting, a high-level source told Egypt’s state-linked Al-Qahera news on Monday. Preliminary investigations showed that Egyptian security staff had reacted to an exchange of gunfire “between Israeli forces and members of the Palestinian resistance, which led to shooting in several directions”, the source said, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people – about half of Gaza’s population – displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and that it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State on Monday. The exercise aims to capture would-be voters who have yet to register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. Naija News gathered that the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends. Despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe, on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials, and equipment meant for CVR, it proceeded as scheduled. In response to the call, Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, expressed dissatisfaction, stating that it is unjust to accuse the electoral body in this manner. The CVR exercise, monitored in Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha local governments, indicated that PVC collection was also progressing alongside the continuous voter registration exercise. At the registration site in Ikpoba-Okha, Rhoda Gumus, the INEC National Commissioner overseeing Edo, Delta, and Cross River, expressed contentment with the ongoing exercise and urged registrants to wait patiently as their registrations were processed. Gumus said, “ We have been to Oredo, and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin, and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people, and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable . “ The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha, affirmed that INEC was adequately prepared for the exercise, emphasizing that the flood disaster, which damaged some of the commission’s equipment, would not hinder the operation. Onuoha said, “ We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems, but it has been resolved, and the exercise is going on smoothly, and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful .”",

It is understood that the Brazilian is set to leave Spurs over the next few months, and Milan, who are in the market for a right-back, have been now. The North London club are planning to continue with Pedro Porro as their first-choice right-back, which would leave Emerson with a lack of consistent first-team game time.

        "content": "The Nigeria Police, Lagos State Command, has confirmed the arrest of an online blogger, identified as Stanley Okoruwa for allegedly defaming a businessman, Emeka Okonkwo, popularly known as “E-Money”. The suspect, who was paraded before newsmen on Monday, confessed to the crime and claimed to have used the offending video to boost his followership online. Okoruwa in the said video accused the businessman of having illicit affairs with the wife of the late Nollywood star, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope. He also accused the businessman of being responsible for the death of the late Nollywood star, who died in a boat accident. The spokesperson of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, told newsmen that the suspect would be prosecuted for cyberbullying and defamation of character. ALSO READ: Junior Pope’s wife: E-money confirms arrest of ‘man who defamed him’ He said that the suspect was arrested in Uromi, Delta State, following a petition from the businessman. Hundeyin said, “He is going to be prosecuted because the things he engaged in were criminal in nature. He has allegedly defamed E-Money and he is going to be prosecuted. “We are not prosecuting the suspect because of the personality involved, but because he has allegedly committed a crime, the personality goes through the normal channel by reporting the case to the police and we investigated and arrested the suspect.” Hundeyin warned social media users against content that is injurious to other people’s personalities, stressing that action may be taken against them if reports of their content were found offensive by anyone. The suspect, while speaking with newsmen, said “I did a video about E-Money. I said a lot of things that are not true in that video, that is why the police arrested me.” He added, “I said something regarding a video I saw online about a woman – saying that Sir E-Money is responsible for the things that happened to Nollywood Actor, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope’s case. “I said something like that, I also said that Sir E-Money was also having an affair with Junior Pope’s wife. I have never in my life met E-Money. Everything I made in that video was not true.” Continuing, he said, ” I made the video out of trying to boost my page traffic level, I never knew it would go viral the way it went. I don’t have a bad intention to spoil Sir E-Money’s name. I was just making the video, I didn’t know it would go such wide.” “I know the contents of the video were wrong of me to have made. I don’t know the video will escalate to that extent,” the suspect added. Stanley stated, ” I saw that the video was already going viral, I thought pulling it down will not make sense. I decided to leave it. I have not reached out to E-Money to apologise, because I don’t have his contact to do so. “I was already planning to make an apology video, that was when I was arrested by the police. I have been praying to have this opportunity to apologize to him. I am very sorry Sir E-Money, I don’t mean to tarnish his image, I didn’t mean to spoil his name online.”",

        "content": "World leaders were swift to condemn Israeli strikes on a tent camp in Rafah late Sunday, which killed at least 45 people and injured dozens, according to Gaza health authorities — focusing further scrutiny on Israel’s controversial offensive in the south. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons” and called for “an immediate cease-fire.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified” by the news from Rafah. “There is no safe place in Gaza,” he said. “These attacks must stop immediately.” Borrell said the attack underscored the “dilemma” facing the international community over how to enforce Friday’s ruling from the International Court of Justice, which ordered an immediate halt to Israel’s offensive in Rafah. Israel dismissed the order and said its military operations would continue. In an address to parliament Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Rafah strike a “tragic accident” but vowed to gain “absolute victory” in Gaza. GET CAUGHT UP Summarized stories to quickly stay informed “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” a White House National Security Council Spokesperson said in a statement Monday afternoon, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Qatar expressed concern that the bombardment would “complicate ongoing mediation efforts and thwart reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent cease-fire,” as well as the release of Israeli hostages. Israel’s military confirmed it carried out an airstrike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night based on “precise intelligence.” The strike killed two senior Hamas officials, it added, including Yassin Rabia, the commander of the group’s operations in the West Bank. A Hamas official confirmed to The Post that two of members of the group had been killed. The IDF said in a statement Monday there were “many measures taken before the attack to minimize harm to non-involved people, including using precision weaponry. Based on these measures, no harm was expected to non-involved civilians.” The incident was being investigated by an “independent body responsible for examining unusual incidents in combat,” the IDF added. The United Nations’ Middle East envoy, Tor Wennesland, called on Israel to carry out a “thorough and transparent” investigation. Video posted by local journalists in the immediate aftermath late Sunday showed charred bodies being pulled from the flaming wreckage of the densely packed encampment in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood. An Israeli strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians killed dozens in Rafah on May 26. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post) Muhammad Al-Mughair, a civil defense official in Gaza, told The Post that the makeshift camp was inside Block 2371, which he said was an Israeli-designated humanitarian safe zone for displaced Palestinians. Residents in the block were not ordered to evacuate ahead of the strikes, and there was confusion on the ground as to whether Israel had designated it a humanitarian zone. Gazans told The Post that Arabic-language pamphlets previously dropped by the Israel Defense Forces over Gaza about safe zones — a key source of information for people there — were imprecisely phrased. Al-Mughair said it was his understanding that the block was included. Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 The area was not pictured in a map of humanitarian zones provided by the IDF online and in recent announcements. In its statement, the IDF said “the attack did not take place in the humanitarian area in Al Mawasi, where the IDF called for evacuations.” At least 800,00 Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s military campaign in Rafah in recent weeks, and many have fled to Mawasi. But new arrivals have told The Post the area is desolate and devoid of even the most basic services. Of the 45 people killed in the Rafah strike, about half were women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry reported. “We are horrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe,” Doctors Without Borders wrote on X. The medical organization said more than 15 of the dead and dozens of the injured were brought to a trauma stabilization center that it supports. “The images of charred bodies, including children ... are unbearable,” read a statement from the foreign office in Germany, which has been one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe. “The civilian population in Gaza must urgently be better protected.” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of pushing forward with “military action that has been asked to stop” after Rafah strikes. (Video: Reuters) Egypt’s armed forces said it was investigating a shooting incident at the Rafah border area Monday that killed a member of its security forces. The IDF confirmed a “shooting incident at the Egyptian border” Monday, which it said it was also investigating. “A dialogue is underway with the Egyptians,” the IDF added. A former Egyptian official told the Post that details of the incident could be outlined by a joint committee as early as Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The IDF said that eight rockets were launched from Rafah toward central Israel on Sunday and that its Iron Dome defense system intercepted a number of them. Hamas’s military arm, the al-Qassam Brigades, said it had launched projectiles toward Tel Aviv, stating that the move was in response to “massacres perpetrated on civilians.” Far-right Israeli settlers have stepped up attacks on aid trucks passing through the West Bank, using a web of publicly accessible WhatsApp groups to track the trucks and coordinate attacks, The Post reported. It comes as humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza resumed Sunday via Israel’s Kerem Shalom border crossing. A U.S. congressional delegation visited Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi on Monday, according to the government’s State Information Service. The cross-party delegation was led by Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). “The members noted Egypt’s great contribution as a pillar of regional stability,” the statement said and “they expressed their appreciation for the Egyptian efforts to establish peace and security in the region, highlighting the key Egyptian role in promoting efforts aimed at achieving a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.” The IDF said it expanded its operations into eastern Jabalya over the past few days. It said in a Monday statement that its troops in northern Gaza killed militants in close-quarters combat, located large amounts of weaponry, and dismantled an explosives manufacturing facility and tunnel shafts. The Israel Air Force also struck a launch site in Jabalya, the IDF said, from which attacks had been launched toward the Israeli city of Ashkelon during the war. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 36,000 since the war began , according to the Gaza Health Ministry on Monday. At least 36,050 people have been killed and 81,026 injured in Gaza since the war started, the ministry said, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 282 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operations in Gaza.

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police recreated the mayor-KSRTC driver feud according to the complaint about the KSRTC bus driver not allowing the Mayor’s car to pass through. The complaint also alleged that the driver showed obscene gestures at the family members. The trip was recreated four days ago to confirm the allegations against driver Yadhu. On the 25th, the police travelled from Plamoodu to PMG by driving a bus, followed by a car at the same time. The cantonment assistant commissioner confirmed receiving strong evidence to support the mayor's complaint. The police found that the person in the back seat of the car could see the driver making obscene gestures. The Cantonment Police had registered a case against Yadhu for insulting women. The Assistant Commissioner stated that it is customary to record mahazar in such cases. Apart from the mayor, her husband Sachin Dev MLA, Arya's brother and sister-in-law were also in the car. Their car, which was returning after the wedding reception, was not given space by the KSRTC bus. The mayor’s car then blocked the bus in front of the Palayam shopping complex and she alleged the driver of reckless driving and also making obscene gestures. Passengers stated that Sachin Dev boarded the bus during an argument with the bus driver. The conductor's trip sheet also says that Sachin boarded the bus. However, Sachin told the police that he did not board the bus and did not disrupt the service.",

        "content": "Stock image (Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live) Police are appealing for information following criminal damage to a number of buildings in the Cookstown area. Graffiti has been noted in several areas of the Co Tyrone town, including James Street, Burn Road and Loy Street, and is being investigated as a racially-motivated hate crime. The graffiti depicts nazi symbols and uses aggressive racist language. Local policing Inspector Ross said: \"I want to assure the public that we take all reports of hate crime extremely seriously. There is no place in our society for such behaviour. Enquiries are ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to call 101, quoting reference number 1255 of 27/05/24.” Read more: Man 'covered in blood' arrested on suspicion of attempted murder READ MORE: Teenager left unconscious after group attack in park SDLP Mid Ulster candidate Cllr Denise Johnston has condemned the appearance of racist graffiti in Cookstown, some of it outside a local school. Cllr Denise Johnston said: “This graffiti is absolutely disgusting. It has no place here and it doesn’t represent people in Cookstown. I’ve been here this morning talking to people, everyone is shocked and horrified at the naked and aggressive hate that has been put on display. “I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this to come forward to police. The recent raise in hate incidents is a serious problem and it underscores how urgently we need new legislation to deal with people who think that they can attack others in our community and get away with it. I will be writing to the Justice Minister seeking an urgent update on her promised hate crime law. “We have been in touch with the council to make sure this graffiti is removed as soon as possible.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Gov Kefas inaugurates committee to investigate Taraba television station Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Gov Kefas inaugurates committee to investigate Taraba television station Published on May 27, 2024 By Great Ozozoyin A committee tasked with the responsibility of investigating the activities of the Taraba Television Station has been inaugurated by the state government. This development followed Governor Agbu Kefas’ recent suspension of the general manager of the station. Inaugurating the committee mandated to carry out the investigation, the Taraba State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Yakubu Maikasuwa, urged its members to adhere strictly to the stated terms of reference. He also charged them to distance themselves from witch-hunting any person, urging them to be just and fair in their assignment. The committee’s terms of reference include investigating the station’s revenue inflows from advertisements and other revenue streams. The members of the committee were also urged to assess the sustainability strategies used to ensure debt reduction and savings at the station. Apart from examining the reasons behind why the station has been off the air for quite a while, the committee members are also to investigate the alleged insubordination and lack of adherence to the directive to use part of the monthly overhead to reduce debt. Overall, they have also been directed to recommend whether the station should pursue full or partial commercialisation for self-sustainability. Headed by Justice Hamidu Audu, the five-man committee, through its secretary, Liberty Andrew, has called for the submission of memoranda from the public, staff of the station and other professional unions.

        "content": "PARIS Hilton has shown off her growing babies while on a family vacation in Hawai'i. The reality star and socialite was joined by her rarely seen brother, Barron, and his own wife and kids. Paris and Barron reunited for a relaxing vacation at the Grand Wailea resort in Maui . The 43-year-old shared a series of photos and videos from her trip to her Instagram. Paris smiled as she relaxed on a pink bed, in pink loungewear, while cuddling with her kids . She shares two children with husband Carter Reum - a son named Phoenix and a daughter London . She is also step-mom to Carter's older daughter, Evie, from his previous relationship with Laura Bellizzi. Joining them on the trip, and appearing in a family photo, was brother Barron, his wife, Tessa, and their kids. \"Reliving my childhood and carrying on our family vacation tradition at the @GrandWailea with my beautiful family,\" Paris captioned the collection. In the comments section, fans lauded the hotel heiress and her children. \"Most beautiful family,\" one person commented, as another echoed, \"I cannot handle the cuteness.\" \"Being a mom is by far your greatest look,\" a third noted. While a fourth gushed, \"London is SO CUTE!!!! I don’t have enough available brain cells to process.\" As one person complimented, \"I am so happy for Paris because she got everything she ever wished for.\" Paris better enjoy her vacations while she can, because she will soon be getting back to work on a new reality show. Being a mom is by far your greatest look.\" And she'll do so with Nicole Richie , 42, more than 20 years after their first paired outing. The iconic duo previously worked together from 2003 to 2007 on The Simple Life . Paris teased her reality return on Instagram, posting a video of a classic television broadcasting static noise. Suddenly, Paris and Nicole's voices could be heard singing, and then yelling their personal theme song, Sanasa. \"New Era. Same Besties,\" she captioned. \"Coming soon to Peacock.\" Earlier this month, Paris and Nicole teased something was in the works when they posted a collage of different milestone events throughout their friendship, including early 2000s selfies and childhood snaps. \"From Day 1: Sill and Bill,\" they captioned their posts, referring to the nicknames they gave one another on The Simple Life. Once the news was official , fans online went wild. \"A pop culture renaissance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" one person exclaimed. \"The OGs of reality show!!\" another declared. \"The real celebrities we love!! Yaaaas!! Can’t wait queens. \"So f**king excited!,\" a third added. \"I have no words but Slivin. That’s Hot!\" Paris and Nicole became household names, and punchlines, nearly two decades ago, as their reality show, The Simple Life followed the two high-end celebs experiencing life outside their bubble by working low-paying jobs . The first season aired in 2003, and documented Paris and Nicole's one-month stay in Arkansas with a farm family. A year later, the besties headed out in a pink pickup truck where they participated in many different jobs, including fishing and working as maids, for Season 2. During Season 3, the iconic duo worked several different internships across the United States , and in Season 4, they took on the role of being wives in a family. In the final season, Paris and Nicole worked at a summer camp as counselors.",

        "content": "Tom King ( James Chase ) reached another shocking low in Monday’s (May 27) episode of Emmerdale as he prepared to poison Piper the dog. Tom is currently on his own in the village due to Belle ( Eden Taylor-Draper ) spending time in a mental health unit. This development happened last week, when Belle spoke to a nurse and said she knows her mental health is struggling, and is worried about what may happen next. We know that Belle’s difficulties with her mental health are being exacerbated as a result of Tom’s abusive behaviour. During Tom’s latest plan of making it seem as though Belle was the one with anger problems, he wound her up so much, Belle pushed him to the floor in front of Rhona (Zoe Henry), Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Vanessa ( Michelle Hardwick ). To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Discovering Belle’s decision to spend time away from the Dales left Tom terrified. He had no choice but to say goodbye to Belle, fully aware she would be surrounded by people who want to help her and that she could say anything. In tonight’s episode of the ITV soap, Tom spent time with Lydia (Karen Blick). As they chatted about Belle, Tom learnt that his wife had asked Lydia to visit her. Lydia tried to tell Tom that Belle probably didn’t want him to see her in a dark place. Out of control, Tom had to come up with another plan – and it was horrific.

As a result of Tom’s ( James Chase ) abusive behaviour, poor Belle is now struggling and decided time away from the village would be safer for her. Watching Belle drive away was challenging for Tom – and not because he found it difficult to see his wife in a dark place. All alone and surrounded by professionals who want to help her, Belle could end up telling someone about her abusive relationship – and an out of control Tom knew he had to do something about it. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Unable to visit Belle because she asked Lydia (Karen Blick) to see her instead, Tom developed a plan in the hope his wife would return home – and it involved poisoning Piper the dog. Meanwhile, in the mental health unit, Belle was speaking with her therapist. Belle started the session feeling a little puzzled. She said how in the past, when she experienced problems with her mental health, she would hear voices in her head – and that isn’t happening this time. Continuing to open up, it became apparent that Belle believed every recent thing she’d been through with Tom were all her fault. She said she makes Tom feel like he isn’t good enough and thought he had to prove himself just so they could share a house together. Belle’s therapist then put forward the theory her relapses happen as a result of triggers within relationships. ‘You think Tom’s the problem?’, Belle asked. ‘Do you think he is?’, the therapist responded. At this point, a fearful and anxious Belle said no, but then ‘I don’t know’ immediately after.

        "content": "It’s been confirmed that Ruby Fox-Miligan ( Beth Cordingly ) and Rose Jackson (Christine Tremarco) are working together in Emmerdale to destroy Kim Tate ( Claire King ). Up until Monday’s (May 27) episode, we’ve known Rose as simply Dawn’s ( Olivia Bromley ) estranged mother – and someone who is annoying Kim a great deal. All she’s been doing for the past few weeks is trying to develop a connection with Dawn and enjoying Kim’s posh drinks tray – but it seems that’s all set to change from here on in. After a brief interaction between Rose and Ruby in the pub, which established they know each other somehow, they then met up at the graveyard. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Rose alluded to the fact she didn’t want to be a part of Ruby’s plan anymore, because Dawn’s son Evan is poorly and it was making her feel terrible. Ruby told her friend that once their revenge is complete, she’ll be able to be a mum to Dawn – something she’s always wanted. So, what’s the plan? Split Kim and Will (Dean Andrews) up, let Ruby take Home Farm (something Caleb (William Ash) believes belongs to them anyway) and allow Rose to emotionally support Dawn when everything falls apart. It appears Ruby has been secretly developing quite the plot on behalf of her husband, who’s own plan to destroy Kim Tate failed spectacularly last year. But will it work this time?

At the end of their chat, Rose was reassured by Ruby when she said absolutely no one would find out about this – which is always a case of famous last words because the duo had failed to spot Ethan (Emile John) overhearing their entire chat. But given the fact we know he’ll collapse soon, will Ethan be too late in his attempt at exposing Ruby and Rose?

        "description": "\"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",
        "content": "Bill Walton's long, strange trip Bill Walton's long, strange trip 04:30 Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award.

Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988, according to CBS Sports . Before his pro career, Walton earned a legendary status at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for iconic coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a pronounced stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his color commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his tangent-filled commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. Bill Walton watches the action during the second half of the college basketball game between the Arizona Wildcats and the New Mexico Lobos at McKale Center on December 20, 2016 in Tucson, Arizona. Chris Coduto/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He is survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. More from CBS News Richard M.

        "description": "The minister said they are reviewing the concession process of major airports to ensure it is more transparent to deliver world-class infrastructure.The post Tinubu to review Buhari’s concession of two Nigerian airports appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "Nigeria’s Aviation Minister, Festus Keyamo, has said the Bola Tinubu administration will review the Buhari administration’s concession of two major airports to make it more transparent. The minister made this known in Abuja while delivering his remarks at the ongoing ministerial sectoral update in commemoration of President Bola Tinubu’s one year in office. “We are starting the process of concession of airports all over again to make it more transparent,” the minister said, adding that “bureaucracy cannot run public infrastructure”. The minister also said Nigeria’s national carrier, Nigeria Air, remains suspended. He said what was launched last year by his immediate predecessor, Hadi Sarika, was an Ethiopian Airlines plane bearing Nigeria’s flag. “Nigeria Air must be fully indigenous,” Mr Keyamo said. Last year, after several failed promises, Mr Sirika launched Nigeria’s national carrier, Nigeria Air, less than three days before leaving office. The development further heightened concerns among Nigerians, as many took to social media to question the move and Mr Sirika’s handling of the airline’s proposed operation.

The House of Representatives Committee on Aviation later called for the suspension of the establishment of Nigeria Air and for the prosecution of those involved in the unveiling of the national carrier, describing the exercise as a “ fraud”. Similarly, less than two weeks to the end of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the concession of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja, and Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA), Kano, to the Corporacion American Airport Consortium. But this was also faulted by the Nigerian Senate last July during the plenary presided over by the Deputy Senate President, Barau Jibrin. By the agreement on the concession, Corporacion America Airports Consortium would make an upfront payment of $7 million to run the Abuja airport for 20 years and $1.5 million for Kano airport for 30 years. The total revenue from the concession of the two airports during the period is estimated at over $4 billion. Upon assuming office last year, Mr Keyamo announced the suspension of plans for Nigeria Air’s operations and airport concessions. During the ministerial briefing on Monday, the minister disclosed that the ministry under his watch has a robust plan for the sector. “Despite current challenges, there is hope and confidence about the future of the aviation sector,” the minister said. He listed the key focus of his ministry to include the development of a master plan for major airports in the country to transform them into proper hubs. Mr Keyamo added that the government is reviewing the concession process of major airports to ensure it is more transparent to deliver world-class infrastructure. There are also plans to support and empower local operators to compete with other international airlines on more international routes, facilitate the acquisition of aircraft under dry lease agreements, and review BASA to favour local operators.

        "content": "Chief Minister M K Stalin’s visionary schemes aimed at promoting education have enabled the State to finish on top by achieving a 49 per cent GER (Gross Enrolment Ratio) as per the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) and the pushing up the percentage of girls from government schools enrolling for higher education to 34 per cent. The surge in girls continuing their education after school is attributed to the ‘Pudumai Penn’ scheme, under which girl students enrolling for higher education courses after studying in government schools from Class 6 to 12 are given a monthly assistance of Rs 1000. The scheme was launched September 6, 2022, by the Chief Minister and has so far benefitted 2, 73,000 students, who not only enrolled for courses in professional and arts and science colleges but polytechnics but continued their studies without dropping out, thanks to the government unfailingly crediting Rs 1000 into their bank accounts, according to government statistics. A few other schemes that had helped students from the lower socioeconomic strata phenomenally enabling them to gain upward mobility in life were the ‘Naan Mudhalvan’ scheme that had benefitted 27 lakh students since 2022 , the stipend paid for first generation graduate students and the industrial skill development scheme. Through the stipend paid for three years for first generation graduates 4,13,241 students had moved up in life with the government spending Rs 1000 crore and under the industrial skill development scheme 10,000 students are chosen every year for a 25-day internship in companies. Apart from a stipend of Rs 16,600 paid during the internship, the students had also managed to land jobs in the same companies, according to Government data. Another 1,2000 students had also benefited from the scheme to teach foreign languages like German, French and Japanese to engineering students with a view to broadening their scope for employment in the international job market. The government spending Rs 50 crore for encouraging research by paying a fellowship of R 25,000 for three years had led to the generation of 1,960 research papers while the installation of LMS (Learning Management Systems) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems at a cost of Rs 150 crore in 14 government universities and the departments of higher education and technical education paved the way for a digital revolution in education. For the Kamaraj College Development Scheme, envisaging the development of infrastructure in all government institutions, Rs 1000 crore was sanctioned for five years. In the first phase in 2022-23 Rs 250 crore and in the next phase in 2023-24 another Rs 200 crore were allocated for additional buildings, new colleges, laboratories and other facilities. The government honoured 10 scientists from the Indian Space Research Organisation by presenting them a purse of Rs 25 lakh each for their contribution to Indian space research and bringing fame to the State. Those who obtained admissions in professional colleges under the 7.5 per cent reservation for students from government schools were able to continue their studies uninterrupted due to the government taking care of their college fees, hostel fees and transport charges by spending Rs 213.37 crore on the 23,601 beneficiaries. The Naan Mudhalvan scheme that trained and groomed 1,84,000 students for tackling entrance tests, interviews and other challenges in the employment market enabled 1,19,000 students to land government jobs and totally benefitted 27 lakh students since its launch in 2022, a government data revealed.",

        "description": "Views on Draft Government Owned Enterprises Bill 2024 should be submitted by June 14.",
        "content": "The National Treasury has invited views from the public on the Draft Government Owned Enterprises Bill 2024. Members of the public have been asked to submit written comments or memoranda before close of business on June 14, 2024. Further, members of the public have been invited to attend in-person public consultations on the Bill in Embu on June 11 at the Kenya School of Government, Eldoret at Sirikwa Hotel and Mombasa at the School of Government. The National Treasury will collect views in Kisumu on June 13 at the Tom Mboya Labour College. The exercise will be conducted in Nairobi at the Bomas of Kenya and Garissa at Government Guest House on June 14. Members of the public are expected to give their opinions on policy priorities in the reform of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The government is moving to reform struggling SOEs in line with agreements arrived at with multilateral lenders. The reform of State Owned Enterprises has been a key part of the ongoing US$4.43 billion (Sh586 billion) programme between Kenya and the IMF. The new policy reforms seek to accelerate privatisation processes of State Owned Enterprises and put in place more streamlined governance structures with clear roles and responsibilities among the entity stakeholders (boards, management, employees). Other priorities are efficient utilisation of budgetary resources, better management of fiscal risks and enhanced accountability. The government introduced the draft policy proposals as it seeks to merge struggling parastatals. The World Bank said the mergers will be focused on most vulnerable SOEs and those with overlapping/duplicated mandates. An Executive Order dated May 24, 2024, said some 25 SOEs would be wound up and their roles channeled back to parent ministries. Prior to this, the government had in November 2023 released a list of 11 loss-making parastatals it said would be privitised The are Kenya Literature Bureau, Kenyatta International Convention Centre, National Oil Corporation, Kenya Seed Company Ltd, Mwea Rice Mills, Western Kenya Rice Mills Ltd , Kenya Pipeline Co, New Kenya Cooperative Creameries, Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, Rivatex East Africa Ltd and Numerical Machining Complex. The government is also developing a Management Information System for the National Treasury and Economic Planning to help strengthen its capacity to monitor and analyse SOEs. The latest update on the restructuring of State Owned Enterprises was made public on April 30, 2024. It said 25 SOEs were proposed for closure and transfered back to the parent ministry or relevant state corporations, 25 others earmarked for privitisation while 41 SOEs with overlapping/duplicated were proposed to be merged. The government indicated that only 158 startegic state corporations would be retained.",

        "content": "Mumbai: The alignment work of Andheri's Gopal Krishna Gokhale bridge with CD Barfiwala flyover is on schedule and expected to be completed within a month. So, the BMC is planning to open the northern arm of the flyover for traffic movement by the end of June, said a senior civic official. The one arm of the newly constructed east-west connector, Gokhale Bridge, was opened on February 26. However, due to the height gap of nearly six feet between the Gokhale and Barfiwala flyover, the motorists are facing inconvenience. After facing severe criticism for the blunder, the BMC undertook the alignment work of both the structures from April 14. \"The disparity between both structures, previously around 1350 mm, has been significantly reduced to just 100 mm as of last week. The work is expected to be completed in the next 2- 3 days. All the work is expected to be completed by June 5, after which the remaining work involves casting and curating,\" said a senior civic official. The work is carried out under the supervision of experts from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT- B) and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI). Meanwhile, the launching of girders and completion of work including surfacing of the railway portion on the southern arm of the Andheri's Gopal Krishna Gokhale bridge has been pushed back to November 15. The civic body has allowed the extension of five and half months for the contractor on Monday. So, the entire Gokhale bridge will now be open for traffic only by March 31, 2025. However, the BMC has also imposed a penalty of Rs. 3 crore on the concerned contractor for the delay.",

        "content": "Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said on Monday that India has progressed rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last 10 years and that today Indian Army has become more powerful than ever before. Adressing a public meeting in favour of BJP candidate from Anandpur Sahib parliamentary constituency, Subhash Sharma, at Jujhar Nagar in Punjab’s Mohali, CM Dhami said, “Give strength to PM Modi by ensuring victory of BJP candidate Subhash Sharma from Anandpur Sahib. Every vote of the public will strengthen the hands of PM Modi”. He also highlighted achievements of the PM Modi-led BJP government in last ten years. “PM Modi is serving the country by considering the whole country as his family. In the last 10 years, India has progressed rapidly under the leadership of the PM Modi. Today, India’s voice is heard seriously in the world. India has made its mark on the world map. Today the construction work of IIT, IIM, AIIMS, airports, highways, expressways is going on. India has become the fifth largest economy in the world,” CM added. The Chief Minister said, “On June 1, unite and vote for the lotus button”. All the 13 Lok Sabha constituencies of Punjab will go to polling on June 1 in the seventh and final phase of voting. The CM added: “The resolution of a developed India will lead to all-round development. G20 was successfully organized in the country. We have a Prime Minister in the form of Modi Ji who lives, works and thinks only for the national interest. Today the Indian Army has become more powerful than ever before. Today the army knows how to answer bullets with bullets,” CM Dhami said. He also referred to the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, abrogation of Article 370 and construction of Ram Mandir. The BJP has promised to implement the Uniform Civil Code on the lines of Uttarakhand in the entire country (If it comes to power), he said. The Chief Minister said that under the leadership of the PM Modi, the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has been constructed. Veer Bal Diwas is being celebrated in the name of the four Sahibzadas of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Their history has been brought before India and the world. Under the leadership of Modi ji, in August 2021, three sacred copies of the holy Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism were brought to India from Afghanistan with full respect, CM Dhami said. He said that there are also big places of Sikhism in Uttarakhand. The doors of Hemkund Sahib have opened in Uttarakhand. Hemkund Yatra is very difficult. To simplify the Hemkund Sahib Yatra, PM Modi ji has laid the foundation stone of ropeway there. Ropeway work has also started for Kedarnath, CM Dhami said. “Before 2014, scams used to come to the fore every day. The opposition is only doing the politics of appeasement. Congress has started the work of snatching the reservation of Other Backward Classes and giving it to a particular class. Aam Aadmi Party has left Congress behind in corruption. The head of their party himself has gone to jail, its people just want to cheat others. Congress and AAP are working together to cheat the countrymen,” CM Dhami said. He said that in Haryana, Congress and AAP are contesting elections together and in Punjab, “These people are fighting among themselves. The condition of Punjab is worse than ever under the rule of AAP”",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Mbah inaugurate 8th Traditional Rulers Council, charges them on community security Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Mbah inaugurate 8th Traditional Rulers Council, charges them on community security Published on May 27, 2024 By Emmanuel Ugwueze Enugu State governor, Dr. Peter Mbah, has inaugurated the 8th Council of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council, charging royal fathers to take charge of the security of their respective communities through partnership with the government across all levels. This was even as the Chairman of the Council, Igwe Samuel Asadu, the traditional ruler of Edem-Ani Autonomous Community in Nsukka Local Government Area of the state, assured that traditional rulers in the state would key into the administration’s vision, mobilize against insecurity and ensure the success of the government. Governor Mbah, who inaugurated the council on Monday at the House of Chiefs Chamber of the Enugu State House of Assembly Complex, Enugu, stressed that the functions of the traditional institution go beyond being custodias of culture and tradition to fostering peace and unity as well as serving as the eyes and ears of the government. “We are also taking this opportunity to remind ourselves that beyond being the custodians of our tradition and culture, you are also the ears and eyes of the government in your various communities so that when we talk about security challenges we are having in communities, we expect to work with you in partnership to address those security challenges,” he said. The governor further enjoined the royal fathers to work closely with the government and their subjects, serving as agents of positive change in the communication process in a way that their subjects would understand and appreciate the policies and programmes of the government on education, infrastructure, healthcare, security, and their general wellbeing. Highlighting some of the impactful projects the administration was executing across communities in the state, Governor Mbah explained that the government was taking deliberate steps to ensure that no child of learning age is denied quality education through the 260 smart green schools across the 260 electoral wards, adding that education, training of youths on skills acquisition and human capacity building that the state had already embarked were serving as the greatest weapons against insecurity. He said the robust programmes of the administration would be difficult to accomplish if traditional rulers continue to live outside their communities since they are the eyes and ears of the government who have roles to play in community development. While congratulating the new council, the State Commissioner for Chieftaincy Matters, Hon. Okey Ogbodo explained that the process leading to the selection of the council was based on fidelity, integrity and commitment to the robust development programmes of the government to the people, saying the criteria was in line with section 3(1) of the state traditional rulers law. Reacting, the Chairman of the council pledged not to disappoint the state as they would continue to ensure the success of the administration. Igwe Asadu, while describing the governor as an agent of positive change whose landmark achievements cut across communities, said the first state-financed project in the history of their community was instituted by the Mbah administration. “The governor said he would provide water in Enugu within 180 days, and he made it happen. He talked about roads, you can see it happening everywhere. He talked about smart schools. I’m very honoured that, that was the first time my town received anything from the government,” he further disclosed.

        "content": "Sport | Football Transfer news LIVE! Arsenal are keen to strengthen in attack, as they prepare for another busy summer transfer window. The Gunners are reportedly in a battle with Bayern Munich and Barcelona for £43m-rated Nico Williams, while Newcastle star Alexander Isak has been linked too. It is also claimed they will contend too with Tottenham and Manchester United for French starlet Desire Doue. United are eyeing defensive reinforcements, with Chelsea ’s Levi Colwill said to be on the shortlist. Chelsea are hoping to sign both Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise and Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, though need a new manager first as they close in on top target Enzo Maresca of Leicester in the race to succeed Mauricio Pochettino, who, along with Thomas Frank, has been sounded out to potentially replace Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford with a decision over the Dutchman’s future expected this week following an end-of-season review. Kieran McKenna is now understood to be out of the race , but Roberto De Zerbi is an option. Tottenham are said to be lining up the likes of Ivan Toney, Jarrad Branthwaite and Evanilson as part of ambitious summer plans, while Liverpool could look to make either Leny Yoro or Leeds winger Crysencio Summerville their first signing under new boss Arne Slot. Follow all the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip live below! Latest transfer news and rumours Live updates Ivan Toney is available for between £30-40million this summer. That’s according to TEAMtalk, with it claimed that Brentford have been forced to lower their valuation as the striker enters the final 12 months of his contract. Ange Postecoglou is believed to have urged Tottenham to sign a striker this window, with Toney high on the wishlist, and a reduced asking price has significantly improved Spurs’ hopes of getting their man. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are among the clubs interested in a summer move for Nico Williams. Recent reports have suggested Arsenal are very keen on the 21-year-old, who plays for Athletic Bilbao and is believed to have a release clause of around £43m. However, according to Relevo, Bayern are eyeing Williams and will monitor him at the Euros, while Barcelona have long admired the winger. Levi Colwill is among the centre-backs being considered by Manchester United. The Daily Star claim that United are refusing to meet Everton’s £80m asking price for Jarrad Branthwaite, and will be on if it is not lowered to around £60m. It’s suggested that other targets being lined up are Chelsea’s Colwill, Marc Guehi and Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. One manager not on the move this summer is Unai Emery. The Aston Villa boss has signed a new five-year contract, after leading the club into the Champions League. His time in England with Arsenal didn’t work out, but Emery is evidently loving life at Villa, committing his future through to 2029. Sofyan Amrabat has indicated that he could yet stay at Manchester United this summer. The Moroccan midfielder has endured a difficult season-long loan spell at Old Trafford from Serie A side Fiorentina, starting only 10 matches in the Premier League and limited to a lot of substitute cameos under Erik ten Hag. However, Amrabat’s influence grew as he showed signs of improvement during the final stages of the season, starting the last three Premier League matches and also Saturday’s surprise 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City in a memorable FA Cup final triumph at Wembley that guaranteed Europa League qualification for next term. Amrabat’s previous struggles to convince during a season that resulted in an eighth-place Premier League finish - their worst league position for 34 years - had led many to believe that there was very little chance of United exercising their €25million (£21m) option to sign him on a permanent basis this summer, having already spent €10m (£8m) on the initial loan deal. However, his recent resurgence could have changed minds. \"Do I already know what I’m going to do next year? No. We are going to talk,\" he told Dutch outlet Ziggo Sport. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" Read more on that here! The manager fun continues... Graham Potter has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea, after what proved to be a disastrous move from Brighton. The Guardian report that Potter is now in contention for a Premier League return... with Brighton. The Seagulls are on the hunt for a new manager after Roberto De Zerbi’s departure, and Potter is being considered Kieran McKenna is increasingly likely to remain at Ipswich. The Athletic report that McKenna is now expected to sign a long-term contract, ensuring he will lead the club in the Premier League next season. Chelsea have already moved on, but McKenna was still a target for Manchester United and Brighton. Newcastle are considering a move for Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford. Recent reports have suggested Chelsea are keen on Trafford, who was recently named in England’s pre-Euro 2024 training squad and is believed to be valued at around £20m. However, the Mail report that Newcastle are also now considering a move, after refusing to meet Arsenal’s £30m asking price for Aaron Ramsdale. Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson and Bernardo Silva all face uncertain futures at Manchester City. The Times report that Ederson and De Bruyne are both attracting interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Ederson in particular could be persuaded to make the move, it is suggested, while De Bruyne is a target as he enters the final 12 months of his current contract. Silva will be allowed to leave this summer if City receive a £50m offer. PSG and Barcelona are both keen, but the Spanish side are unlikely to be able to afford the fee. Over to the latest on Manchester United’s managerial situation now. We know that Erik ten Hag’s Old Trafford future will be determined this week during an end-of-season review by the club, with speculation that he is still likely to be removed despite Saturday’s FA Cup success at Wembley making it an obviously more difficult decision. However, the Manchester Evening News now report that United are actually considering keeping Ten Hag for next season, informing the representatives of potential new managerial candidates that they have not ruled out retaining their current boss. Ten Hag has one year left to run on the three-year contract he signed after swapping Ajax for United in the summer of 2022, with the Red Devils possessing the option to trigger a further 12 months beyond that. The plot thickens... Have your say...",

CM Arvind Kejriwal held a roadshow in Jalandhar on Monday. He was campaigning for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Lok Sabha candidate from Jalandhar Pawan Kumar Tinu. CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Home Minister Amit Shah has challenged 3 crore people of Punjab yesterday. He said after June 4 they are going dismiss the elected government of Punjab. This is dictatorship. People of the country will not accept it. I have come to ask all 13 seats from you. I assure that only the voice of Punjab will echo inside Lok Sabha. In the last 10 years whoever you elected has not raised your concerns. We will raise issues of Punjab in Lok Sabha and find out solution to all the issues which are pending with the centre.” He further said that there is no use voting for BJP, Akali Dal or the Congress. “If you vote for the BJP or Akali Dal then it is of no use. If you vote for Congress they will start quarrelling against us. Give all the 13 seats to AAP we will work together,” he added. AAP’s Pawan Kumar Tinu, INDIA alliance’s Charanjit Singh Channi, NDA’s Sushil Kumar Rinku, and Akali Dal’s Mohinder Singh Kaypee will contest elections from Jalandhar Lok Sabha seat. Earlier Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the AAP for not living up to the promises assured to Punjab and criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making the state a hub of corruption. Slamming the government of AAP, Amit Shah claimed that AAP is a government that is known for breaking promises. “This is the government of the AAP party, it is a government which breaks promises. Rs 1000 were not given to every mother and sister, Punjab was not made drug-free in a month, and 16 medical colleges were not opened up in the state,” Shah said.

Officials said that the replacement started Monday and will continue over the next six months to move, refurbish and install several systems and devices. “It will substantially improve reliability and will keep our facility operating at high availability along with the world’s best synchrotrons for the next decade and beyond,” said Mark Boland, CLS Machine director.

About 80-90 per cent of the equipment being replaced will be recycled, with the remaining ten per cent will be donated to universities or museums. The overall budget for this replacement is $15 million.

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Carnival Cruise Line marked its return to Baltimore on Sunday with the arrival of Carnival Pride, resuming its year-round operations from the homeport. A video captured the ship entering the port, showcasing the event. Carnival Pride is set to embark on a 14-day round-trip Carnival Journeys cruise to Greenland. Following this voyage, the ship will maintain its scheduled itineraries, which are planned through to the spring of 2026. This comes after the temporary relocation of Carnival’s Baltimore operations to Norfolk, Virginia, due to the Key Bridge collapse on March 26. Known as America’s Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Line is a frontrunner in modern cruising, operating a fleet of 23 ships that aim to deliver enjoyable and memorable vacation experiences at an excellent value. In 2021, the fleet welcomed the Mardi Gras, a 5,282-passenger ship that set sail from Port Canaveral, Florida. It stands out as the first cruise ship in North America that runs on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and features the first roller coaster at sea. Looking ahead, Mardi Gras will be joined by its sister ship, Carnival Celebration, in late 2022 departing from Miami, and Carnival Jubilee, which will start operations from Galveston, Texas, in late 2023.",

        "content": "A kitchen fire that broke out over the weekend has forced the closure of a popular Clinton Township diner. The fire at Ken’s Country Kitchen in the Amore Plaza shopping center on Hayes Road was reported after 3 p.m. Sunday, a short time after the employees had left the building for the day, the owner says. Zef Camaj, who co-owns the restaurant with Alex Gjelaj, said before workers left, they had thoroughly cleaned the kitchen. He suspects one worker may have accidentally knocked a pilot on a grill, which eventually sparked the blaze. “The thing is, we recently completed a remodeling of the building, completely revamped it,” Camaj said. “We couldn’t make it better than it was.” Clinton Township Fire Department administrators were not available to comment Monday because of the holiday. The diner was known for its breakfast dishes, Camaj said. Ken’s Country Kitchen was a consistent winner in the Macomb Daily’s annual reader’s choice contest, and had also won similar contests with the Detroit Free Press and WDIV-TV (Channel 4). “The lucky part is, no one was inside when this happened, so nobody was injured. We are happy about that,” Camaj added. Ken’s Country Kitchen had originally opened in the 1990s at the Clinton Township location. In recent years, the partner decided to venture out to the northern part of the county, and opened one on Main Street, north of Division Road (32 Mile Road) in Richmond. The owners say they are offering some of the 20 employees work at the Richmond location until the Clinton Township one is refurbished. When that will be obviously isn’t known at this point. The eatery must deal with its insurance carrier on the damage and related details before it can plan on repairing the facility. “Hello, we will be closed until further notice,” the owner posted on his Facebook page. “We will keep you updated as soon as we know more details.” Camaj also urges Clinton Township customers to drive out to Richmond to enjoy the home cooking they have come to enjoy. “I can tell you this: We will reopen and when we do, we will be better than ever,” he said.",

        "content": "The move by the National Assembly to replace the current national anthem with the former one through an expeditious legislative process suffered a setback on Monday. Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who attended a public hearing on the matter organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, warned that the issue of the National Anthem, should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, enacting a law on National Anthem or replacing the current with the old demands that, Nigerians are carried along. Fagbemi said: “In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. He argued that “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.” “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. According to him, “the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” Former minority leader of the Senate, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said he was totally against the move because the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country’s national prayer. He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government. He said: “While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians. “The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving. “Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as ‘Tribes, Tongues’, Natives’ which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war. “The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer. The lawmaker contended that the present National Anthem was accompanied by a pledge which all children and patriots recite at official functions. “Will reverting back to the old anthem not mean abrogation of the pledge since they go together? He queried. “The peoples of Abia South Senatorial District are desirous of policies and plans to reduce the pump price of petrol from the present 1.000 naira per litre in Aba, the 224 naira per kWh of electricity, the more than 100% increase in food prices than going back to an anthem written by a colonial citizen of Britain and bequeathed to Nigerians at our independence in 1960. Therefore, the people of Abia South Senatorial District in their entirety reject the bill to revert back to the old anthem.” In his submission at the public hearing , the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to change of national anthem. The Minister who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency ( NOA) , Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem does not make a complete meaning. “The issue of national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not have a value national identity which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it.” Also cautioning the National Assembly on expeditious passage of the bill, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it . According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability . He however supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots National Anthem” with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee”, the country started with, in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978 , does not have the required gravitas and not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for Nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace current National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past.

        "content": "A Courtenay, B.C., senior is downsizing and packing to move as she comes to accept she can no longer afford to stay in her home, after falling victim to a scam that robbed her of her life savings worth more than $100,000. “I have to get rid of some excess furniture because I won’t have the space,” says Peggy Christian. “We’re doing okay with it. I think it’ll be a good thing for me.” The 76-year-old needs the win. Christian went public with her story in February 2024 – claiming fraudsters told her they could fix her computer for $200. The scam progressed over months where she was paying with gift cards and withdrew her investments to send wire transfers abroad. Since then, Christian and her family say her health continues to suffer. “The trust that we may have had years ago for people is not there anymore,” says Christian. “She hasn’t been sleeping, and very anxious, and some depression. It’s really hard to see this happen to my sister,” says Christian’s sister, Judy Huska. The Vancouver Island woman is becoming versed in the banking industry, trying to advocate for change where it could help others. “It’s not just about the compensation and helping my sister get some of the money back. But also: What’s the responsibility and the accountability of the bank? And can we bring that to the forefront so that they don’t let this happen to somebody else,” says Huska. Coast Capital is the financial institution where Christian withdrew her funds. The member-owned financial co-operative issued a statement to CTV News, in part, saying it cannot speak to individual situations, members or their accounts for privacy reasons. “We take these matters very seriously, investigating each case thoroughly,” says the statement. “We also rely on the vigilance of our members to keep their information and accounts safe and secure. This includes being aware of potential scams, regularly reviewing accounts and, if there is suspicious activity, reporting it immediately so that we can help secure the account and address any fraudulent transactions” Christian’s family says they have struggled to get answers to some of their questions – and feel staff should’ve seen red flags as the woman cashed out her investments to send the wire transfers abroad. “Peg feels that if she was just asked ‘are you being coerced’ that she would’ve broken down and said this is happening to me,” says Huska. The family wants the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments to investigate their situation. OBSI is an independent and impartial service that resolves disputes between banking services, investment firms and their customers. A spokesperson for OBSI says it cannot comment on individual complaints where it might be involved in the case. A general information bulletin on OBSI’s website reminds people financial services firms don’t automatically reimburse money when someone becomes a victim of fraud. It suggests it can happen though depending on how the loss or fraud occurred, such as the firm having reason to suspect a person might be exposed to fraud but did not act. The site says customers may be held responsible in cases where they unknowingly sent funds to a fraudster or authorized a firm to transfer money from their account to someone else – among other common scenarios. Christian and her family have also been in touch with their local MP to explore potential avenues for regulatory changes at the federal level. And they say they’re grateful to the Office of the Seniors Advocate in B.C. for helping Christian arrange more affordable housing and income support. A GoFund Me is also raising money on her behalf since her budget has been cut by 50 per cent. “This shouldn’t happen to anybody at all,” says Christian.",

        "content": "by: Iman Palm Posted: May 27, 2024 / 11:22 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:22 AM PDT Burger King is set to re-launch its $5 value meal, according to multiple reports. The news comes after its competitor McDonald’s announced plans to bring back a similar $5 meal deal last week. Burger King’s latest promotion will allow customers to choose between one of three sandwiches, along with chicken nuggets, fries and a drink. The burger chain didn’t announce a roll-out date for its $5 meal deal but did share that it will begin on a trial basis ahead of McDonald’s promotion, which is set to debut on June 25, reports say. KTLA reached out to Burger King about the new deal but didn’t recieve a response in time for publication. Fast-food companies like Burger King and McDonald’s have begun offering deals and promos in hopes of luring customers, who have opted to eat out less due to high food prices, back into restaurants. Fast-food chains are blaming the rising labor and food costs as the reason behind menu price hikes. Across the U.S., 22 states have raised their minimum wage requirements. In California, fast-food workers make at least $20 an hour after a new law was enacted in April. However, labor advocates disagree that higher employee wages impact menu prices. A March analysis of California fast-food restaurants conducted by the Roosevelt Institute noted the industry’s record profit margins between 2014 and 2023. Those impacted by rising menu prices seem to be low-income Americans after a poll found that about 25% of people who make under $50,000 were cutting back on fast food, citing cost as a primary concern. Company officials for Burger King and McDonald’s have noted that customers have “become sensitive” to prices and that they are working to keep prices affordable for consumers.

        "content": "Under the bright lights, 245 spellers will take the stage this week at National Harbor, near Washington, D.C., for the . The spellers are coming in from all 50 states and from countries in places as far away as Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. All of them are part of the competition's largest group of spellers in five years. Among them is 13-year-old Oviya Amalraj of Virginia. \"I like how it's just you focus on the word and there's an order to how you do it,\" she said. This will be her second time at the Bee, after reaching 23rd place last year. This year, the black belt in tae kwon do hopes to kick her way into the top spot by applying some of the skills she's learned in that martial art. \"I liked how it was like physical and you had to focus a lot,\" Oviya said of her interest in tae kwon do. While she spends some of her free time on the guitar and the piano, Oviya is not the only musician buzzing their way to this year's Bee. Ethan Dunlap, of North Carolina, is another speller who also moonlights as a musician. \"I actually picked it up back in the 7th grade. My dad used to be a saxophone player,\" Ethan said. \"My great-grandfather also played the saxophone. So, I just carried the traits, I guess, and I got pretty good at it.\" For Ethan, 12, this will be his first trip to the Bee, and he was thrilled to find out he qualified after winning his local spelling bee. \"Oh my gosh! I've won and I'm getting to go to the Scripps National Spelling Bee!\" he recalled. \"It's really awesome. I can't wait to go out there and spell my best.\" It's a chance Ethan and his fellow spellers are about to get. The spelling bee begins in earnest Tuesday, with all 245 competitors getting their chance to spell on stage during the preliminary round. From there, the field will slowly dwindle through the quarterfinals and semifinals on Wednesday, before Thursday night's final round and the crowning of a new Bee champion. Watch it all .",

        "description": "On Memorial Day across the state, people gathered in cemeteries to honor and remember the dead who served in the armed forces.",
        "content": "Tucked between Interstate 494 and the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary sits a small, old parish cemetery. And on a rainy Monday morning, as is traditional on Memorial Day, a bell rang out. By the time Carl Rudolph, a Vietnam-era veteran, finished, the bell, glistening with rainwater, rang 86 times — once for each U.S. military veteran buried in the cemetery. Across Minnesota on Memorial Day, people gathered in cemeteries to honor and remember the dead who served in American wars. In Richfield, attendees gathered under grey skies. Betsy Sullivan and her mother, Mary, sat in the front row, under a red tent. They come yearly. Mary's husband, Bill, who served in the National Guard, is buried near the Virgin Mary statute. \"Because we were the holy people,\" Mary said, with a smirk. The only time they remember him being possibly deployed was during Vietnam. \"That night we cried,\" she said. Memorial Day around the U.S. evoked a somber mood, as the nation, ever divided by partisan politics and an upcoming presidential election, breathed with the tender remembrance of men and women who gave their lives serving in the U.S. military, from wars in Europe to the Middle East, from the Civil War to southeast Asia. While Memorial Day, formerly known as Decoration Day, serves as the unofficial beginning to summer, for many it remains a day of hallowed retreat. At Fort Snelling National Cemetery, an umbrella-filled crowd gathered at Fort Snelling National Cemetery where Gov. Tim Walz remarked that the rain felt fitting for the somber occasion. About 258,000 veterans and their family members are buried at roughly 190,000 grave sites. Volunteers place a flag on every single site in the days leading up to Memorial Day. \"All of you here made a choice, a choice to spend your holiday with us to honor and remember our veterans,\" said Andrew Motzko, assistant director of the 436-acre cemetery. This year's Memorial Day program included keynote speaker, Lisa Anderson, deputy comptroller for Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA). The Buffalo, Minn.-native is stationed in Pearl Harbor and works to recover and identify remains of missing service members — sometimes decades after they made the ultimate sacrifice. Anderson said a 25-member team is in the Normandy region of France searching for three missing airmen whose C-47A aircraft was presumably shot down by German anti-aircraft fire on D-Day. Nearly 81,000 U.S. personnel from World War II to present day are still unaccounted for, she said. One of their most recent identifications is Private Robert W. Cash, a graduate of Washburn High School and former student at the University of Minnesota. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces at Fort Snelling on May 8, 1941. He was captured following the American surrender of the Bataan Peninsula in 1942 and was forced on the 65-mile Bataan Death March. The camp was liberated in early 1945, but Cash was buried in a common grave with other deceased American POWs. While identification efforts began in 1947, Cash's remains weren't sent to Anderson's Hawaii laboratory until 2019. Just this last April, Cash was finally identified. \"As we look ahead to the coming year, I hold firm in the belief that by next Memorial Day, we'll witness a reduction in the number of 'unknown' grave markers and an increase in the number of families finding the answers they rightfully deserve,\" Anderson said. In Richfield, an intimate, quieter ceremony unfolded. The parish cemetery harkens back to days when cornfields and haybales populated Richfield. The church in the first-ring suburb of the Twin Cities sits just east of a Best Buy store. A credit union and apartment complex loom over the parish cemetery. Joe Novak, who volunteers with the Knights of Columbus, organizes the annual event. Novak didn't serve in the military but got to know more veterans by helping them attend mass in wheelchairs at the Fort Snelling Veterans Home. Through research, he keeps growing the list of veterans in the cemetery, created by another parish couple. The ceremony opened with an invocation and a Boy Scout troop planting the colors. Then Novak read the names as Rudolph chimed the bell. \"Benajamin E. Haeg.\" \"Ferdinand M. Bunger.\" \"Bernard F. Fritz.\" Eighty-six names for the small cemetery. Eighty-six families and stories. When the names were over, a Boy Scout played taps on the trombone. The cemetery stretches back to the parish's founding by German immigrants in the 1870s. In a far corner, mottled headstones, rounded by the years, carry the names of children with a lamb and a cross. \"Josephine Biott, May 6, 1880 to Sept 9, 1881.\" \"It really gives you a sense for how tough times were,\" said Betsy Sullivan, who now serves as the parish's music director. The cemetery is a window to the past. On Monday, American flags also dotted the base of grey headstones. A number of interred bear the name of the military conflict that they served in. \"World War II.\" \"Korea.\" Novak estimates veterans of the Spanish-American War, possibly even the Civil War, are buried in the small cemetery. After the ceremony, in the church entryway, attendees munched on cookies and sipped coffee. Dick DeGonda recalled that his brothers, from Le Center, Minn., both served in WWII. By pure chance, the brothers bumped into each other on an island in the Pacific. \"It made the Le Center paper,\" Dick's wife, Mary, said with a smile. Across the room, two sisters and a cousin spoke about their father's time in liberated France. Susan Poquette Keenan said her father walked under the Eiffel Tower. \"Only once did we see him cry,\" said Keenan, describing when their father saw a U.S. serviceman, deceased, clutching to the wheel of an American tank. When they returned to the U.S., many of the veterans purchased homes in Richfield and other suburbs on the G.I bill. The post-war boom would soon engulf the region's farmland. But not the church. And not the cemetery, where Keenan's father is buried. So, for another Memorial Day, while rain fell, families under umbrellas and carrying flowers, walked through the grassy aisles of the small burial ground, under the buzz of interstate traffic.",

        "content": "The 33rd edition of the COMEX Global Technology Show opened in Muscat on Monday heralding significant technological advancements and investment pledges exceeding RO60mn on the first day. The event, presided over by H H Sayyid Theyazin bin Haitham al Said, Minister of Culture, Sports and Youth, is seeing the participation of over 100 local and international tech institutions. Organised by OITE in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MTCIT), the exhibition – running until May 30 – aims to foster digital investments, as it displays cutting-edge technologies and electronic services. H E Dr Ali bin Amer al Shidhani, Undersecretary for Communications and Information Technology in MTCIT, highlighted the National Programme for Digital Economy’s objective to increase the digital economy’s GDP contribution from 2% to 10% by 2040. This ambitious goal is supported by eight executive programmes for sectors such as digital industry, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and cybersecurity, the undersecretary informed. “Since the launch of the National Programme for Digital Economy in October 2021, the information and communications technology sector has seen investments of over RO1bn (US$2.5bn),” stated H E Shidhani. He noted that these investments have primarily enhanced communications technologies, data processing, and cybersecurity. He also underlined the significant increase in the value of agreements and projects announced at this year’s COMEX compared to the previous year, with new initiatives aimed at developing technical infrastructure and supporting the digital economy through the Omani Investment Authority. The opening ceremony was marked by several key agreements that will boost Oman’s digital infrastructure. These agreements include the establishment of the largest national data centre by Oman Data Park and Middle East Information Systems Company at US$25mn in the first phase; a strategic partnership between Omantel and Google to set up a regional centre for edge cloud services at RO2mn; and another significant agreement with Amazon Cloud Services to create a sovereign cloud service centre and an integrated e-commerce platform in Oman at a cost of RO24mn. An agreement was also signed among MTCIT, ITHCA Group and Nortal Company, to develop and design the Unified National Portal for electronic government services. H E Shidhani informed that MTCIT is set to launch several high-value projects, including the Omani Linguistic Model and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum. Additional initiatives include the Unified National Portal for Government Services and the Special Technology Zone for Startups. Amr Baabood, CEO of OITE Group, appreciated the role that the COMEX exhibition was playing in showcasing contemporary digital transformation opportunities for over three decades. “This event plays a crucial role in enhancing understanding of rapid global technological advancements and their impact on economic diversification,” Baabood said.",

        "content": "Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar/Mumbai, May 27 (PTI) A video purportedly containing remarks against a particular community in the backdrop of tension between two caste groups in a village in Beed district has gone viral, prompting leaders of various political parties to appeal for peace. Maharashtra Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis (BJP) and Ajit Pawar (NCP) have appealed for maintaining peace and avoiding such commentary. Beed Superintendent of Police, Nand Kumar Thakur, on Monday, rushed to Mundewadi village in Kej tehsil and held a meeting with villagers. The video clip went viral on Sunday against the backdrop of tensions between members of the Maratha and Vanjari communities. Some villagers in the video clip, which went viral on Sunday, can be heard saying that no 'Maharaj' (religious preacher) from the Maratha community should be invited to the village. Villagers also asked others not to consume liquor from a shop, while a man threatened that those violating this diktat would be penalised. \"A meeting was conducted in Mundewadi village after the video clip went viral. After speaking with villagers, it was found that there was no casteism among them,\" the superintendent of police said. Explaining the demography, he said members of a particular community dominate the population in the village, while others from another caste group are in minority. \"The sarpanch of this village is from the community which is in the minority,\" he said. When asked about the contents of the video, the SP said villagers took a decision (on not purchasing liquor from a particular shop) in view of some problems in Nandur phata area. \"There is no casteism in this video. A person said something in excitement but villagers didn't support such a stand. The villagers are not following any such appeal. This video is 15-20 days old,\" Thakur added. Notably, the caste fault lines became deeper during the campaigning for BJP's Pankaja Munde, a Vanjari, and NCP (SP) candidate Bajarang Sonawane, a Maratha, during recent Lok Sabha elections in Beed constituency. Fadnavis said he didn't think such videos could damage social fabric. \"Both communities (Marathas and Vanjari) have lived together for a long time. Some people do attempt to create suspicion between them, but such attempts won't succeed. Sensible people from both communities should stop people from trying to divide society,\" he said. Ajit Pawar said he didn't have detailed information about the situation but one should not forget that we live in a society that follows the framework of the Constitution. \"If someone tries to defy it, legal action will be taken against such people,\" he added.",

There's no discernible reception, and no staff to be seen, so for a few minutes I can kid myself that I am popping in to pick something up before returning to the huge garden. Sunlight streams into the art filled, comfortable living room (to the right of the front door) and snug seating area (to the left of the front door). The newly opened Dining Room can be glimpsed straight ahead, next to which the winding staircase leads up to the nine en suite bedrooms. This listed Georgian mansion was once home to a Michelin Star restaurant, but was bought in 2022 by Cabin Studio (the team behind London's Sessions Arts Club). They've been running the Garden Cafe, situated within the home's 20 acres, since last year and have only just reopened the Dining Room. Situated in what was once the grand house's breakfast parlour, The Dining Room's menus utilise the home grown produce wherever possible, venturing further afield around Scotland only when necessary.

        "content": "New data from Visit Scotland has shown a growth in popularity of Scotland's farm shops, with more than a fifth of holidaymakers visiting a farm shop or farmers' market during a trip to Scotland. The Scotland Visitor Survey 2023, one of the biggest undertaken by the national tourism organisation found 22% of visitors said they spent time at a farm shop or farmers' market. The activity was particularly popular with visitors from Australasia with almost a third (30%) highlighting the experience. Typically conducted every three or four years, this is the first time the Scotland Visitor Survey has been undertaken since the pandemic. As we head into summer, now is a great time to visit Scotland's farm shops. With this in mind, here are some of the best to check out. Gloagburn Farm Shop (Gloagburn Farm, Tibbermore, Perth, PH1 1QL, 01738 840 864) This charming farm shop and café is owned by third generation farmers Ian and Alison Niven. The couple opened the shop in 2003, and have made the business a local success. Gloagburn Farm has been run by the Niven family since 1924, and currently produces free range eggs, beef, wheat, barley and vegetables. If you're around in the morning, the hearty cooked breakfast is the perfect way to start the day – local sausages, Ayrshire bacon, Stornoway black pudding, poached egg, tomato and toast. There are also delicious home-made soups, sandwiches and cakes to tuck into. Bowhouse (St Monans, East Neuk, Anstruther KY10 2DB) Based on Balcaskie Estate - which covers 2,000 acres of organic and regeneratively farmed land - in the East Neuk of Fife, Bowhouse has been developed as a centre for food and drink.

        "content": "Feis Ile is underway - it runs from 21 May-1 June - and Islay residents, distilleries and festival goers are preparing themselves for one of the biggest events in the whisky calendar. This year, one of those gearing up for the festivities is Eva Cumming, who took over as distillery manager of Caol Ila last summer, one of the oldest distilleries on the island. Eva will be diving in to her first Fèis Ìle this year, playing host to thousands of visitors, helping to lead an expert team through its dedicated Caol Ila Day (27 May), and even taking centre stage as she shares what makes Caol Ila such a signature smoky Speyside whisky in The Ultimate Managers Evening (30 May). The Scotsman caught up with Eva to hear what visitors can expect this year and what she's looking forward to the most at Fèis Ìle. What are you most looking forward to about this year's Feis? Here at Caol Ila distillery, we're used to having people travel far and wide to get to us, but Fèis Ìle gives us a chance to get together with our fans for a few days and explore together the whisky we all love so much. The conversations that are had when whisky fans get together are always amazing. Whisky means so much to people, and often in ways which are unexpected, so the stories and memories which are shared are always fascinating. Fèis Ìle offers up a rare chance delve into what Coal Ila means to those who have made the journey to join us, and as a fairly new member of the team,... Rosalind Erskine",

        "content": "They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I'm more in the 'get your own bloomin' ideas, pal', camp. When I saw that this place was opening, I was stoked. I genuinely thought the Glasgow restaurant, Sugo, which is owned by the people behind west coast pizza restaurant Paesano, was coming to the Capital. The branding and concept was so similar that my brain short-wired when it came to the actual name. We spread the word. My husband's Sicilian colleague was ebullient. He couldn't wait. Then we did a double take. Oops. Our mistake. Anyway, I still thought I'd pay it a visit, though they'd got my hackles up. Everyone wants a restaurant to be 'authentic', even if that's just an expertly cultivated illusion. If you think someone has cynically copied a successful formula, that idea is shattered. But, you know, maybe it's all an accident. They're not identical, after all. Unlike Sugo, Ragu, which is owned by the people behind Salerno Pizza at St James Quarter, has got someone making pasta in the window, as if George Street is a wholesome version of Amsterdam's De Wallen. They also haven't gone for a communal seating arrangement. That's a point in their favour, as I'm not into being the meat in a stranger sandwich.

        "content": "Was Johnny Wactor Married? Wife, Family Details and Cause of Death Revealed By Johnny Wactor’s death has left many deeply shocked. The talented actor was most well known for his role in General Hospital and many fans are curious about the actor’s personal life in the wake of his sudden death. Here are all the details of his personal life and what happened to him. Did Johnny Wactor have a wife? No, John Wactor wasn’t married and didn’t have a wife. Wactor had always kept his personal life away from the public eye, making fans curious whether he was in a relationship or not. As per , in 2022, he was allegedly linked with Kaitlin Sullivan, following their posted close moments on his social media handle. The two never openly confirmed their low-key relationship. Their shared images also now seem to be deleted, indicating that they might have parted ways earlier. Moreover, it was reportedly known that he was single and was focused on his acting career before his untimely death. Johnny Wactor cause of death As per , Johnny Wactor died when he was shot by one of the three suspects who came to rob a vehicle’s catalytic converter on Saturday near Pica Boulevard and Hope Street. Wactor’s mother Scarlett spoke with and gave out details on what happened to her son. She revealed that he and his co-worker were returning from their bartending duties at a rooftop bar around 3 am or 3:30 am. That’s when they saw three men whom he thought were towing his car. However, when Wactor interrupted them, a masked man shot him. Wactor was quickly taken to a local hospital. However, it was too late by then and he didn’t survive. Johnny Wactor’s death was confirmed by his agent David Shaul in an official statement, released by Variety, where he shared his kind words. “Johnny Wactor was a spectacular human being. Not just a talented actor who was committed to his craft but a real moral example to everyone who knew him. Standing for hard work, tenacity and a never give up attitude. In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be. Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever,” Shaul said. The police have opened an investigation and are on the search for the three suspects, who ran away from the crime scene. Shazmeen is a writer, entertainment journalist, and movie aficionado at core. She holds a degree in multimedia and mass communication, specializing in advertising, but her ardor for cinema led her into entertainment journalism. While her cinematic preferences know no bounds, she specifically has fondness for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, psychological thrillers, horror, and films with profound philosophical undertones.

        "content": "In short: The federal Department of Parliamentary Services is facing allegations of a toxic culture that silences dissent and covers up problems. Critics say the department has largely been overlooked in the reckoning that happened at Parliament House in recent years. It comes amid reports of a relationship between the two top public servants within the department. It's the government department tasked with protecting Australia's democracy, yet within it bubbles accusations of a toxic culture, the silencing of dissent and the routine cover-up of problems. The department governs Parliament House but some of its staff are so suspicious and fearful of those running it, they regard it as a workplace where \"the walls have eyes\". The ABC has spent months speaking to public servants — past and present — plus politicians and their staff from both sides of the political aisle, as well as people who have worked across a range of professions at Parliament House, all of whom would only speak under the condition of anonymity. Repeatedly and without prompting the word \"toxic\" was offered about the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS). And yet efforts to scrutinise its operations, its management and practices are practically impossible — by design. That's because DPS has been granted extraordinary and unique isolation from standard methods of scrutiny — and by someone who once promised to meet the public's higher expectations. The department is exempt from Freedom of Information laws — a change Anthony Albanese, as the then leader of the House of Representatives, introduced as an \"interim measure\" more than a decade ago. Rob Stefanic gave evidence about Ms Saunders to senators in February but didn't disclose their relationship. ( AAP: Mick Tsikas ) To its critics, DPS has largely been overlooked in the reckoning that happened at Parliament House in recent years, where a spotlight has been shone on the culture and treatment of staff following Brittany Higgins's...

Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially.” Minaj said she spent around six hours in custody at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on Saturday before being able to fly to the UK. Fans were let into the newly-opened Manchester venue at around 7pm on Saturday for her show, before promoter Live Nation announced at around 9.40pm that it was to be postponed. Dutch police said a woman aged 41 was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to take what it described as “soft drugs” from Schiphol Airport to another country. A later update from the force said it had released the “suspect and she can now move on” after paying a fine. A post shared by Barbie (@nickiminaj) It marked the latest postponed gig at the Co-op Live arena which has been plagued with issues since trying to open in April. Minaj had praised fans for being a “class act” during the last-minute postponement, and invited them to her hotel in the centre of Manchester before speaking to the crowds outside. The music star, who is known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, livestreamed her arrest on social media and claimed drugs found in her luggage did not belong to her. She performed at Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena on Sunday.",

        "content": "Muttrah, the landmark tourist attraction in Muscat, will soon undergo major transformation with the addition of an iconic Muttrah Square Project, a multi-storey car parking and several cafés around the neighbourhood. The Municipal Council of Muscat on Monday held its fifth meeting of the year, chaired by Sayyid Saud bin Hilal al Busaidi, Governor of Muscat, in the presence of Ahmed al Humaidi, Chairman of Muscat Municipality. On the sidelines of the meeting, Humaidi said, “The municipality is finalising detailed maps for the development of Muttrah, which includes the enhancement of corniche and the establishment of cafés and restaurants in the residential neighbourhoods.” Additionally, the municipality will commence the implementation of the Muttrah Square Project during the third quarter of this year, he informed. “A tender has also been issued for the construction of a multi-storey car park in Muttrah to alleviate traffic congestion.” Muttrah Square Project involves construction of an iconic bridge in the shape of an arch looming over the middle of the square by the sea, which had won the first edition of the Bilarab bin Haitham Award for Architectural Design. Inspired by the sword of Imam al Salt bin Malik al Kharusi, the iconic structure will offer a view of all the famous landmarks of Muttrah. The arched bridge will have a mixed-use plaza, a dancing fountain, retail stores and cafés. During the meeting, the council reviewed the Omran Group’s statement regarding the Sultan Qaboos Port waterfront development project. Omran is leading the redevelopment of the area, projected to be crucial in transforming Muttrah into a premier tourist destination with the highest international standards. The national project aligns with Oman Vision 2040 and the National Tourism Strategy that seek to enhance efforts to create unique tourist destinations and experiences. The multi-use tourism project will adhere to considerations set by the Oman Investment Authority, ensuring it adds value without disrupting the port’s location, historical, and architectural heritage.",

        "content": "Now that we have a “small heavyweight” as a champ, it may be time to remember one of the best of that bunch. The great Ezzard Charles died on a day like today in 1975. Born in Lawrenceville, Georgia in 1921, Charles followed the path of many other African-Americans in those years, going from the deep south to the industrial north and relocating to Cincinnati, Ohio at a young age. He was an outstanding amateur who won the Chicago Golden Gloves and the national AAU middleweight championship after a 42-0 blitzkrieg of a campaign, and then jumped to the pros in March 1940 with a third-round knockout over Melody Johnson at 160 pounds. The “Cincinnati Cobra” outgrew the division ten fights into his career, but continued fighting in the 160-165-pound range as a light-heavyweight for years, often being outweighed by as much as 15 pounds by his foes. In spite of scoring some of his most extraordinary wins at 175, Charles never received the opportunity of fighting for the world title at that division, in which he is nevertheless considered perhaps the finest pure boxer ever. Wins over the likes of Archie Moore, Charley Burley, Joey Maxim, Jimmy Bivins, Lloyd Marshall and many others were not enough for him to gain access to the coveted world title clash. And after the death of Sam Baroudi in 1948 after being stopped by him, Charles hit rock bottom and considered quitting boxing altogether. But ten fights later, and already fighting as a small heavyweight, Charles received the opportunity to face Jersey Joe Walcott for the vacant NBA heavyweight belt left behind by Joe Louis. In a beautiful display of footwork, skills, wit and power, Charles became the heavyweight champion of the world on June 22, 1949, and went on to make eight defenses of his belt against the likes of Walcott (rematch), Maxim, Gus Lesnevich, a badly faded Joe Louis, and others. Finally, in 1951, his third bout against Walcott ended with Charles losing his belt after being stopped in seven round s. He would lose again to Walcott in a rematch, but he continued fighting for eight more years, defeating Cesar Brion, Rex Layne and Bob Satterfield before losing back-to-back title bouts against Rocky Marciano in 1954 . He would amass a 10-13 record after those two bouts in what was the last stretch of his career before calling it quits in 1959. After his ring days were over, he worked as a wrestler and did several menial jobs before falling victim to Lou Gehrig’s Disease and becoming wheelchair-bound in the last years of his life. Charles died in 1975. He had been named The Ring’s Fighter of the Year in 1949 and 1950, and was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the inaugural class of 1990. Diego M. Morilla has written for The Ring since 2013. He has also written for HBO.com, ESPN.com and many other magazines, websites, newspapers and outlets since 1993.

        "content": "The executives of Esa-Oke Central Union in Osun State on Monday donated a generating set to the town maternity centre. The union also commissioned a renovated toilet for market women and cleared an eight-kilometre abandoned Imesi to Esa-Oke road. Speaking during the inauguration and swearing-in ceremony of executives, the union chairman, Gbamigboye Aremu said the gesture was to ease the affairs of the residents of the town. He said, “The reason why we donated the generating set was due to the complaint by those working in the maternity centre that they don’t usually get light during the delivery of pregnant women. “After the complaints, we the executives of the union tasked ourselves and get the generator for the maternity to aid their service delivery. “Also, the leadership of the market women came to us that they needed us to renovate their toilets for convenience which we also do. “We also cleared the bushy portion of Imesi to Esa-Oke road which has been abandoned by road users. Motorists are scared to pass the road for fear of being kidnapped but now, we have cleared the road and expanded it and our people can make use of it now.” Aremu appealed to the leadership of the community maternity centre and market to make proper use of the donated equipment and toilet. “I want to appeal to the beneficiaries to make proper use of the donated equipment. We have done our part and we are still aiming to do more but they also have to maintain those things judiciously .” The monarch of the town, Adeyemi Adediran, appreciated the union for their kind gesture, calling on sons and daughters of the community to always give back to their community.

        "content": "The Royal Oman Police (ROP) has introduced a new feature in its mobile app that allows motorists to view images of their traffic violations. This announcement was made at the opening of the COMEX Show on Monday. During the exhibition, Brigadier Nasser bin Musallam al Ruzaiqi, Director General of Information Technology at ROP, explained that the police department launched several comprehensive new services, including renewal of vehicle registrations through self-service machines, e-linking of the Supreme Judicial Council for marriage registrations and payment of traffic fines using payment portals such as Thawani and Tasdeed. The new service also includes reprinting of lost vehicle licences via self-service kioks after submitting the request through the ROP app, he added. “The Royal Oman Police is making great efforts to contribute to achieving the objectives of Oman Vision 2040 by introducing innovative initiatives, preparing thoughtful plans, qualifying and training human cadres, and harnessing available resources,” Brigadier Ruzaiqi elaborated. He stressed the continued modernisation and development of ROP’s technical system using the latest technological tools and means, such as artificial intelligence. In this context, Brigadier Ruzaiqi added that the ROP mobile app provides a comprehensive platform for inquiry and payment of local or Gulf traffic and municipal fines whether of an individual or a company. “Users can download violation reports, search by service category and period, and view e-payment history. The app enables users to check violations associated with a specific vehicle, ensuring the owner’s data matches with the vehicle’s data.”",

        "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves find themselves in a tough spot, trailing 0-3 going into game four vs the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. With elimination looming, conversations are already shifting towards what next season might hold for this roster. NBA insider, Evan Sidery (Forbes Sports, Sporting News) , shared some interesting insights about the Timberwolves’ plans this offseason, a topic that has been in the back of many minds, given the luxury tax penalties that loom large over the organization. Minnesota Timberwolves running it back in 2024-25? Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels’ new contracts both kick in next season, not to mention a $14 million raise for Karl-Anthony Towns. In total, the Wolves are one of only two teams already projected into the 2nd apron of the league’s luxury tax system, which will cost a projected $50 million tax payment next year. That’s why many are questioning whether or not the Wolves could trade Karl-Anthony Towns and blow up their big three . Some even suggested that Jaden McDaniels could be on the trade block too . But in a somewhat convoluted Twitter post Monday, Sidery tried to put Minnesota Timberwolves fans at ease, writing that the Timberwolves are “very likely to run it back next season”. The Timberwolves will be paying $172.4 million to five players next season: Karl-Anthony Towns = $49.3 million Rudy Gobert = $43.9 million Anthony Edwards = $42.3 million Jaden McDaniels = $22.9 million Naz Reid = $14.0 million Minnesota’s ongoing ownership war featuring Glen... pic.twitter.com/ujFTO0vKiX Minnesota’s ongoing ownership war featuring Glen Taylor vs. Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore is another interesting wrinkle to their long-term roster decisions. Minnesota will very likely run it back next season, but Rudy Gobert becomes extension-eligible this offseason. If the Timberwolves fork over a lucrative extension to Gobert, what does the immediate future hold for Towns? As we get ready to enter the offseason, there are plenty of uncertainties swirling around the Timberwolves organization. The biggest immediate question surrounds their ability to do the impossible and turn this series around. Then there’s the Tim Connelly opt out , and the ongoing ownership war ... As fans eagerly await answers, it’s clear that significant decisions lie ahead that will shape the trajectory of the franchise. Keeping the core team intact would be an expensive way to show fans that the organization is willing to invest in the club, no matter whose name is on it when this all shakes out.

        "description": "He urged Americans 'to remember and honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation.'",
        "content": "President Joe Biden on May 27 paid tribute to fallen service members during his Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, stating that they had “fought for a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity, and equality.” “We gathered at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember and honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives to this nation,” he said to begin his remarks. “Each one bound by common commitment, not to a place, not to a person, not to a president, but to an idea, unlike any idea in human history, the idea of the United States of America.” Memorial Day was officially proclaimed in 1868 to honor Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. After World War I, it was expanded to commemorate all those who died in military service. During his remarks, President Biden also made veiled criticisms of his rival, former President Donald Trump, as he has done in recent days. “Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It’s the very soul of America. It’s how we’ve been able to constantly adapt to the centuries,” the president said. “And just as our fallen heroes have kept the ultimate faith with our country and our democracy, we must keep faith with them,” he added. President Biden also remembered his son Beau, a veteran and former federal prosecutor, who died of cancer in 2015. “This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau. ... He didn’t perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim from a consequence of being in the Army in Iraq for a year next to a burn pit,” he said. President Biden and his campaign recently have stepped up their efforts to win veterans who traditionally back Republicans. “Since I took office, I’ve signed over 30 bipartisan laws supporting servicemen, veterans and their families, caregivers, and survivors,” the president said at the ceremony. He launched a series of events last week aimed at focusing on veterans and military members. On May 21, he delivered a speech in New Hampshire, marking a milestone for the PACT Act, a bipartisan law he signed two years ago to expand health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances. The President announced that Veteran Affairs has already approved more than one million claims under the PACT Act. President Biden also delivered a commencement address on May 25 at the U.S. Military Academy’s graduation ceremony at West Point in upstate New York. The president delivered the address to nearly 1,000 cadets graduating from the 222-year-old academy who have joined the ranks of the U.S. Army as officers. He urged graduates to keep fast to the values they learned at West Point and, most importantly, their oath. “On your very first day at West Point, you raised your right hands and took an oath—not to a political party, not to a president, but to the Constitution of the United States of America—against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” President Biden said. The 156th National Memorial Day ceremony began with the traditional wreath-laying. President Biden was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. “Our arms and technology are the envy of the world. But in the end, America’s greatest strategic asset will always be our people,” Mr. Austin said during a speech at the ceremony. “So, let us always remember our fallen heroes must always strive to defend the democracy for which they fought and died.”",

        "content": "THE Blue Kumuls and FC Genesis clashed in a thrilling encounter that showcased the best of their skills, with both teams refusing to yield in the Port Moresby soccer association men’s premier division match on Saturday. In the end, they had to settle for a hard-fought draw, leaving both sets of fans eagerly anticipating their next showdown. Both teams wasted no time when five minutes from kickoff, Blue Kumuls were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty box. Hans Tapio (15) unleashed a powerful shot that ricocheted off the crossbar. After that, Genesis upped the ante, launching a sustained attack that yielded two successive corner kicks. Unfortunately, they couldn’t capitalise on the opportunities. Play continued in Genesis half of the field with Blue Kumuls midfield team of Steven Inia and Tapio probing the Genesis defence when a sneak pass found Jordan Kaven (11) who shot from within the box right on the 18th minute for Blue Kumuls to lead 1-0. A scramble in the Blue Kumul’s penalty box ten minutes later found Genesis number 16 Ezekiel Vela with a loose ball that he calmly pushed past keeper Baniau to level the scores at 1-1. The game’s intensity increased with the occasional push and shove that drew a couple of yellow cards to both sides. Blue Kumuls Inia occasionally tried using wide balls but was cut off by the defence of Nathan Togs and his company of youthful defenders for Genesis. Three minutes to half-time Genesis number 4, Stanley Kila picked up a missed ball by a Blue Kumuls defender only to miss what could have been the easiest of goals. Genesis came back in the second half all fired up with right winger Kaniyosi making his usual runs let loose a shot that hit the left post much to the delight of the supporters on the sidelines. Midfielders led by Benjamin Kila continued with their threatening runs into Blue Kumuls territory but the strikers time and again could not find the mark with their shots. Number 16 Vela made several attempts at goal but most were wide also. Niebo and Ara also made attempts for Genesis without much success. Ten minutes later a clearance header from a corner to Steven Inia found henchman Tapio who shot unchallenged from the edge of the box to just tip the crossbar. That miss brought deafening sighs to the Blue Kumuls supporters. Inia continued with his through balls when a pass landed in front of teammate Steven Giwibing (2) who fumbled right in the box much to the dismay of the sighing supporters. A minute to time Steven Inia was assisted off-field with an injury with the scores remaining at one all until full-time. Marty Terry of Blue Kumuls commented saying: “ We had our chances but could not finish off well. “And yes both teams played well also’’ Genesis’s Emmanuel Liosi said: “Blue Kumuls is a respected team in the premier division and when you play them you take them seriously. “Yes our youthful team did their best but we did miss a lot of chances also.”",

        "content": "The caravan, which Mr Browne admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels Reporter: Reporter 27 May 2024 7:15 PM A 71-year-old security guard, William Browne, was shocked to discover his caravan, purchased a month prior, was missing from his property after returning from his early morning shift. Speaking to Joe Duffy on RTÉ's Liveline, William, who starts work in Dublin at 5am, was informed one morning last week by his daughter at approximately 10am that the caravan had been taken. It was confirmed that South Dublin County Council's Environmental team removed the caravan following several complaints from local residents. The caravan, which William admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels. Originally from Wexford, now living in Clondalkin, he said that he had planned to use the caravan for visits home, especially during summer when relatives come to visit. Despite words from council staff that the caravan was not an issue as long as it was unoccupied, William was surprised by the action taken against him. It is said that a notice citing the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act required him to remove the \"temporary dwelling\" within one day, with warnings of a €1,270 fine. The caravan, which they joked was something from 'Father Ted,' was on a grassy spot until it was seized. \"There's an patch of grass, westbound, at the side of my house and there's surveillance there on the wall, and that's where the carvan was,\" said William. Later, Joe responded: \" What did they think you were doing? Setting up a halting site or something.\" After calling the council's environmental office after receiving a letter regarding the caravan, William received no answer so took to visit the Tallaght-based office. It said that the situation remains unresolved, and the caravan is still seized. William, who also owns a small boat and a jeep which can pull the caravan, was disappointed over the council’s actions. Given previous health struggles which he detailed on the show, including past heart surgery, a stroke, diabetes, and chronic asthma, William told Joe of his worries on his health regarding the stress of the ordeal.

        "description": "Former glamour model Katie Price and ex-fiancé Carl Woods split up last year. Katie recently shared a new post about 'five reasons the narcissist hates you'",
        "content": "Katie Price shared a post detailing 'five reasons the narcissist hates you' months after her split from Carl Woods. The former glamour model, who is currently dating Married At First Sight UK star JJ Slater, was previously engaged to Love Island star Carl. The duo were in an on-ff relationship since they first started dating in 2020. They were believed to have split up again in November last year but sparked reconciliation rumours the following month when they were seen together . Not long after, Katie was seen enjoying cosy nights out with JJ before confirming their relationship on social media. Katie, who doesn't shy away from sharing cryptic posts about her exes, recently took to her social media to share a post about narcissism on her Stories. The post read: \"Five reasons the narcissist hates you: 1. You've stopped falling for their lies 2. They've lost the control they once had over you 3. You've cracked their facade and see them for who they really are 4. You're no longer desperate for their approval 5. Their schemes and tricks don't work on you anymore.\" Katie shared a new post about narcissism on her page ( Image: Instagram/ @katieprice) The duo, who were in an on-off relationship for a few years, split last year ( Image: Getty Images) Back in February, Carl made a few digs about the split as he praised himself for getting himself through the tough period. Carl vowed to keep a 'low profile' and focus on himself after the breakup. Taking to his Instagram stories, the former Love Island star made a number of digs at his ex-fiancée. In one story post, Carl showed off his adorable new puppy as he joked that his new pet pooch was 'doing his head in'. However, he also commended his dog's immense 'loyalty' as he said it was the 'most important thing'. In another story, Carl re-shared an inspirational video which said: \"God knows when to send you exactly what you need. Being private, staying low-key, and not telling everyone everything is self-care. Seek respect, not attention.\" Carl then appeared to reference his split with Katie as he re-shared yet another inspirational video. \"I love you enough to let you go,\" the video started. \"Go find that person that you say is better than me. Everything hurts when you love somebody. I love for real.\" Meanwhile, Carl and Katie's other ex Kieran Hayler united at Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire and looked all smiles as they shared a video of their outing on social media. However, one of their mutual pals present couldn't help but point out the meeting was \"awkward\", while jokingly putting a hand to their mouth as the camera panned around. This isn't the first time Kieran and Carl spend time together as they previously celebrated Easter Sunday as a duo - which allegedly left their famous ex furious.

        "content": "Lionel Messi’s annual salary he receives from Inter Miami has been revealed by the press sources. Lionel Messi gets $20.45 million annual net salary from Inter Miami, making him the highest paid player in the American League, according to The Guardian . This is ahead of the whole clubs which do not pay this much amount to their full-player rosters. With $12 million as a basic salary, in addition to various bonuses, the Argentine player joined Inter Miami. As Messi earned 138 million euros in one season during his last contract with Barcelona in 2017, the Argentine player’s salary at Inter Miami does not appear to be the best in his football career. Messi’s Barcelona salary had a value that included more salaries and bonuses before he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. With a contract extending until the end of 2025, Lionel Messi became part of Inter Miami in July of last year. Moreover, he rejected the idea of ​​​​leaving for the Saudi League, after receiving an astronomical offer from Crescent Moon.",
