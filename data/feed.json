        "content": "The midfielder was not part of David Moyes’ plans for the 2023/24 season and it was decided that the 25-year-old would gain more experience in England’s second division. Downes helped the Saints achieve promotion to the Premier League and was impressive in the play-off final against Leeds on Sunday. Downes featured in 37 games for Southampton this season, scoring two goals and providing a further three assists; however, it was the Englishman’s overall performances that have impressed Saints fans. Many supporters would have been hoping to keep the midfielder at St Mary’s Stadium for their return to the Premier League, but West Ham may have dropped some hints that he will be returning to London. Southampton are believed to have a in Downes’ loan deal, but the Hammers may well keep the 25-year-old. West Ham hint at Flynn Downes’ return According to , West Ham have dropped hints that Downes will be returning to the Premier League club for the 2024/25 campaign. In an article on the after Southampton’s play-off victory on Sunday, the East London outfit made a point of clearly stating it was the end of the 25-year-old’s time with the Saints. On four separate occasions, West Ham referenced the fact the game represented the end of the player’s loan deal. It is uncertain if Downes will have a big role to play under Julen Lopetegui next season but the midfielder could be a solid squad player throughout the campaign.",

        "content": "RAF grounds Battle of Britain planes after tragic death of pilot who was killed in crash during memorial show Mark Long was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash on Saturday afternoon By Dan Grennan Published: 17:11, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:54, 27 May 2024 e-mail 4 View comments The RAF has grounded the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) planes after a Spitfire pilot was killed in a shock crash. Squadron Leader Mark Long's plane crashed a few minutes after taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire as part of a memorial show to mark the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Saturday afternoon. The RAF have now said they have taken the decision to ground BBMF aircraft - which operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft - while investigations into the crash take place. A spokesperson said: 'Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF).' Squadron Leader Mark Long pictured pictured beside an RAF aircraft Sqn Ldr Mark Long pictured reading a map on an RAF airplane Mark Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 Pictured are floral tributes and handwritten notes left at the scene yesterday Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, for renowned pilot Mark Long Grief-stricken supporters Nicki Housam, 53, a former prison officer and partner Andy George, a construction manager, pay their respects to the pilot The RAF also paid tributes to the father-of-two in a touching statement, describing him as 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' who will be 'sorely missed'. The Typhoon pilot took to Instagram just weeks before the memorial show to share his excitement. In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In an older post, the experienced pilot shared a video explaining why they have to be careful about the conditions they fly the vintage aircrafts in. 'We have landed here with the Hurricane and Spitfire ready for react later this afternoon. The reason we landed in Gloucester is actually for cross winds. 'I'll show you around the aircraft and you will see what we are operating and why we are so precious about how we pick our winds, surface and flying conditions.' From under the Hurricane, Long said: 'What a lovely summer we are having right now as temperatures are soaring. The unique element of the Hurricane is that it gets really hot inside but it actually does quite well at keeping itself cool, 'So you have got the massive propeller at the front of the 17-litre Merlin engine but that on the ground forces the air through the radiator'. Leading tributes to the pilot yesterday, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the RAF's Display Air Wing, said: 'Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. 'A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator he will be sorely missed by all that knew him.' He said an investigation into the cause of the 'tragic event' was now underway. 'I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel, and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday. Squadron Leader Mark Long shared footage of a World War II-era plane in flight just weeks before his tragic death. In the post, he said he 'cannot wait' to fly the vintage aircraft in a few weeks The scene where the pilot died in a crash during a Battle of Britain event near RAF Coningsby A Spitfire flown by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pilot Mark Long in April The RAF said in a touching statement that he was 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' 'Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.' This was the first fatality involving a BBMF aircraft since its creation in July 1957, a retired RAF leader told the BBC. BBMF operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft. The pilot qualified to fly Spitfires in 2021 and was lined up to take over running the BBMF next year. His most recent RAF posting was as a flight commander flying Eurofighter Typhoons. He joined the Air Force in 2003, having graduated from the University of Warwick. During his career, Sqn Ldr Long was posted to 11 Squadron at Coningsby, deploying to the Baltics and the South Atlantic. A spectator who witnessed the horrific moment the Spitfire plane nose-dived to the ground, killing the pilot instantly, said: 'Sadly he didn't stand a chance.' The former RAF air craftsman, speaking after the death of the experienced and respected flier during a Battle of Britain event, said: 'I've seen a lot of terrible things in my life but this is up there with the worst.' Sqn Ldr Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 last weekend Mark, who declined to be fully named, saw the horror unfold as he was plane spotting with his partner and her RAF fan 10-year-old son from a car park overlooking the base. Read More BREAKING NEWS Prince William and Princess Kate say they are 'incredibly sad' to hear of death of pilot in Spitfire crash during Battle of Britain event at RAF Coningsby Recalling the tragedy, he said: 'There was an event going on and I saw a Spitfire taking off and flying at about 300 feet towards East Kirkby. 'It was in the distance and suddenly it turned round and was coming back to base. It was swaying and swaying from one side to the other. He would have known there was a problem with the craft and it was awful to watch. 'The pilot would have realised there was a fault and was coming back to try and land safely but suddenly it just plummeted from about 150 feet. 'It just nose-dived, sadly the pilot didn't stand a chance. The way it went down so quickly and people were watching from the car park in horror and disbelief. 'I was hoping it would be a different outcome but I knew there was no surviving that. 'I was there with my partner and her son, who was beside himself with sadness, like many of us. It was devastating to watch. 'You just don't expect something like this to happen .' Tony, speaking yesterday as he lay flowers at the much loved RAF base along with dozens of air enthusiasts and supporters, added: 'A Hurricane was going to take off after the Spitfire but his flight was aborted.' He said the pilot 'must have known there was a problem and he was in difficulty' and would have raised the alarm, saying: 'He would have radio called because in less than a minute the fire service and ambulances were there. 'The whole episode from take off to crash probably only lasted two and a half minutes. Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire to the deceased pilot Dozens of flowers have been left lined up along the fence by the airfield Heartwarming handwritten notes accompany some flowers, reading 'fly high' The location where the Spitfire crashed in a field on on Langrick Road at RAF Coningsby Emergency services arrived following reports of a crash of a single-occupant aircraft in a field on Langrick Road (stock image) 'It is too difficult to estimate the speed.' 'I couldn't clearly see the spot it came down but pictures show it was right beside a house and a tractor so no doubt other people witnessed it too. It is a terrible tragedy.' The man, who lives locally, told how he often took his step son to watch the planes in action at the airfield. He paid warm tribute to the pilot as a 'remarkable and wonderful man' and thrilled children with his 'pep talks.' He recalled: 'At the end of a flight Mark would always make a point of coming up to the big wire fence and give the kids a pep talk through it. 'He'd still be in his uniform, and he'd still have his flight maps pinned to his trousers, above the knees and would pass them to the children through the fence. 'I didn't know him personally but I knew him by reputation as a great pilot and a remarkable and wonderful man. 'He always made time to speak to people so I had to come here today to pay my respects. 'He told the kids that it was dream to become a pilot but he had failed four or five times. 'His message to them was never to give up and that you can always live your dream. 'It is such a terrible tragedy that it was to end in this way for him.' The Spitfire came down at around 1.20pm on Saturday during a display at RAF Coningsby. File image shows the Prince and Princess of Wales with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at RAF Fairford last year Photos from the scene show emergency services gathered around the wreckage of the plane just feet away from a house. It had been taking part in a civilian airshow just nine miles from the base to commemorate the RAF's role in fending off German attacks during the Second World War This year represents the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. The Prince and Princess of Wales have shared their condolences, saying they were 'incredibly sad' to hear of the tragedy. Kate and William, who himself served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot, said in a joint statement that it was 'incredibly sad to hear of the news' and added that their 'thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on X: 'Awful news to see the life of a serving RAF pilot cut short in this tragic event. My thoughts are with their family and loved ones.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was 'deeply saddened' by the news, and thanked the emergency services for their response, adding 'my thoughts are with the pilot's family at this awful time.' The crash has been described as a 'tragic accident' by officials but an investigation has been opened into the cause. Police and ambulance crews raced to the scene and a rescue helicopter was scrambled from neighbouring Humberside. A statement from the Ministry of Defence stated: 'It is with great sadness that we must confirm the death of an RAF pilot in a tragic accident near RAF Coningsby today [Saturday]. 'The pilot's family has been informed and we ask that their privacy is respected at this time.' The pilot who was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash during a Battle of Britain event has been named as a Squadron Leader Mark Long (pictured) due to take over the memorial fight next year Spitfires played a crucial role in the war, especially during the Battle of Britain which earned the plane's power status. Designed as a short-range, high-performance plane, over 20,300 Spitfires were built to secure British success during WW2. It proved to be a watershed moment for the Nazis' territorial aims as they then shifted their focus to conquering Britain. Aware of the resilience of the RAF, German aircrafts bombarded British airfield bases until the autumn of 1940.

        "content": "Fresh blow for Rishi Sunak as outgoing Tory MP Lucy Allan QUITS the party in order to back Reform UK's candidate as her replacement in her Telford seat By Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Published: 12:09 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:01 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 31 View comments Outgoing MP Lucy Allan tonight quit the Tories in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency. Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat. Following her public declaration of support for Mr Adams, the Conservatives took immediate action and suspended Ms Allan from the party. But, in the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the PM's general election campaign, she claimed she had already quit the Tories in order to back Mr Adams' bid. Ms Allan claimed the Reform hopeful was 'genuinely the best person for the job' and warned against allowing the Labour candidate a 'walkover' in Telford. Outgoing MP Lucy Allan has quit the Tories in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat It is the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the Prime Minister's general election campaign She said: 'I have resigned from the Conservative Party to support Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. 'I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can't just let the Labour candidate have a walkover. ' Ms Allan added: 'As a Royal Navy veteran, Alan knows what it means to serve. 'He is the candidate who is most in touch with Telford people and best able to represent them. He will serve all residents, not just those who vote for him. 'Alan is not in it for personal advantage, power, or control over people. Alan's motivation for standing for election is profoundly honourable. He will be honest with Telford and put Telford first. 'Alan gives Telford a choice, so that Telford does not have to settle for more of the same politics and more of the same politicians.' Ms Allan had made her astonishing endorsment of Mr Adams in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. She wrote: 'I am supporting Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. If you want to help Alan or donate to his campaign, sign up on his website alanadams.co.uk.' Reform MP Lee Anderson, a former Tory deputy chairman, replied: 'Thanks Lucy. A great move.' Asked about Ms Allan's revolt against the Tories, Mr Sunak said: 'I think when it comes to Reform, I understand people's frustrations, but it is very simple: either Keir Starmer or me is going to be PM on July 5. 'So if you are someone who wants strong borders and wants to get a grip of illegal migration, if you are someone who wants a more pragmatic, serious, hard-headed approach to Net Zero which prioritises energy security and cutting people's bills, I am going to deliver that, not Keir Starmer. 'That is the choice at this election. So for people who are thinking about voting for other parties, but particularly Reform, all that is going to do is put Keir Starmer in power and you are not going to see any change on the issues that you care about.' A Conservative Party spokesperson said: 'Lucy Allan has been suspended from the Party with immediate effect. 'The people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer .' Responding to Ms Allan's endorsement of their candidate a Reform spokesman said: 'Of course we are absolutely delighted that she is backing our candidate in Telford. 'She, like many Conservatives, feels that the Reform Party represents traditional centre-right values and priorities in a way that the Conservative Party has long forgotten.' Ms Allan was first elected as Conservative MP for Telford at the 2015 general election, when she won the seat off Labour. She defended the seat with a near-11,000 vote majority at the 2019 general election. The Conservatives chose Hannah Campbell as their candidate in the constituency in December last year, after Ms Allan announced her decision to stand down at the general election. It is the latest sign of unrest within the Tory ranks following Mr Sunak's decision to call a general election much earlier than most of his MPs had been expecting. Tory peer Lord Goldsmith, an ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson, hit out at Mr Sunak and indicated he believed the Conservatives were on course for an electoral disaster. 'I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month,' the former minister said. 'But it's hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. 'The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.' Mr Sunak this evening insisted he would remain in the UK, whether or not he won the election. Asked about the claim he would move to California, he told ITV News: 'It's simply not true. I mean, it's just simply not true.' Southampton fan Mr Sunak added: 'This is my home. I mean, my football team just got promoted back in the Premiership and I hope to be watching them for years to come in the Premier League.'

        "content": "In an interview with Fightful , Mark Haskins spoke about Ring of Honor in its current incarnation, which he feels takes a backseat to AEW. Haskins was a part of the original ROH during its final years between 2018 and 2021. He said: “ I think that it’s a very cool take on Ring of Honor. From what I’ve seen, I think that it definitely gets me excited. I’m just glad that things ended, especially with my relationship with it, the way they did because they took so good care of us during COVID. They didn’t release us. They kept us on board. They kept paying us. Then that was one of the biggest driving forces for me was I wanted to be able to come back and be able to repay them in any way that I could. It was a huge motivation for me to be a greater asset by the time that I could get back to America than the time that they last saw me because I was so grateful for the care that they had given towards all of us. So the fact that things ended the way that they did, you know, I’m sad, but what can you do? Do you know what I mean? I’m kind of gutted that they didn’t have another investor just from the The sole point that I think that Ring of Honor was, especially around January, February time, 2020, there was such this vibe that we were, yeah, we’re going to step up. We’re going to take on the world. We’re going to do this, right? So it felt like there could have been another big promotion fighting in that competition between all the big promotions, right? Whereas it’s great that Tony Khan bought it, but I do feel that then it kind of takes a second place to AEW rather than stepping up and being another contender as such. ”",

        "description": "The 38-year-old lost his job at Birmingham in January.",
        "content": "Rooney, who burst on to the Premier League scene as a 16-year-old at Everton, has been handed the reins at Home Park less than five months after losing his job at Birmingham. And the former Manchester United and England forward has backed his ability to develop potential talent in Devon. Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16. I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip. Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward. “That relationship now is going to be so important.”",

        "description": "Trump's constant criticism of his trial judge will not play well with the jury, a former prosecutor has said.",
        "content": "Former President 's repeated attacks on the judge in his criminal hush money case will be seen as disrespectful by the jury, a former prosecutor has said. Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said that Trump doesn't seem to understand that juries have a good relationship with judges. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden told on Monday. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound.\" \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be—a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician—he's a dumb lawyer,\" Walden said. He added that Trump was too involved in his own legal defense. Walden, who previously prosecuted organized crime cases in New York, said the worst defense mistake was calling attorney Robert Costello as a witness. Costello, who had given legal advice to Trump's former attorney and fixer , was called by the defense to undermine Cohen's evidence. Judge Juan Merchan was infuriated by Costello and accused him of interjecting with comments, rolling his eyes and staring at Merchan from the witness stand. Merchan eventually cleared the courtroom of reporters and accused Costello of \"contemptuous\" behavior. He also challenged Costello to stare at him one more time. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden said. \"The defense finally got some momentum, and it all got dialed back because Costello was playing to Trump instead of playing it straight. He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" reached out to Trump's attorney via email for comment on Monday. Costello told on Friday that he had no comment. The prosecution that before the 2016 presidential election, Trump paid or discussed paying adult film star not to discuss an affair she says they had in 2006. Trump, the presumptive 2024 nominee for president, denies the affair. Manhattan District Attorney charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in April 2023, arguing that the payment to Daniels was made through Cohen and that the payment was an illegal campaign contribution because it was intended to silence Daniels and thereby influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains that the case is politically motivated. Cohen was later jailed for illegal campaign contributions, tax fraud and other charges. He is now an implacable opponent of Trump and they have attacked each other's characters on social media posts since the trial began.

In a double blow, an environmental group has filed a new lawsuit against the company over such pollution releases.",
        "content": "Bay Area air quality officials have launched an investigation into Tesla, charging the electric automaker with letting massive amounts of harmful toxins escape into the air from its Fremont car factory. In a double blow, an environmental group has filed a new lawsuit against the company over such pollution releases. Since 2019, Tesla, which made $17.7 billion in profit last year according to regulatory filings, has allowed 112 illegal toxic releases, each containing as much as 750 pounds of harmful contaminants, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District said in a news release early this month. Even low levels of ozone created when the emitted chemicals meet sunlight can harm health, especially for children, older people and those with asthma, the district said. Other released contaminants can cause cancer and, even at low levels, neurological damage and reproductive and developmental damage, according to the regulatory agency, which pointed to Tesla's paint-spraying booths and paint-baking ovens as sources of the pollution. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on the district's investigation and allegations or claims in the lawsuit. District officials announced May 2 that they were seeking an order to shut down the Fremont plant's two car-painting departments if Tesla would not agree to hire outside experts to help stop the emissions. The district said this week that it had previously probed Tesla's pollution from the factory and found it resulted from repeated problems in the painting departments' containment systems and production lines. \"Operational changes were made by Tesla, but ultimately, they were not enough,\" said district spokeswoman Kristina Chu, adding that the agency may sue Tesla over the emissions. Despite \"extensive discussion\" between district officials and the company, Tesla has not stemmed the emissions, the district said in its request for an order from its hearing board, which rules on regulatory-compliance issues. Meanwhile, the car maker led by notoriously regulation-hostile CEO Elon Musk is facing a new lawsuit by a local claiming Tesla's \"extensive and ongoing\" pollutant releases are exposing residents and workers in the area to harmful chemicals, including arsenic. \"It feels to us like profits are more important than actually being a good neighbor and supporting ,\" said Tanya Boyce, executive director of the Environmental Democracy Project, a nonprofit corporation that filed the lawsuit last week in San Francisco U.S. District Court. Boyce noted that children attend Bringhurst Elementary school within a mile of the Tesla plant. Her group's lawsuit, which cites \"a long history of noncompliance with environmental laws\" at the factory, alleged Tesla broke federal air quality rules more than 160 times between January 2021 and January 2024. Records from Tesla submitted with the lawsuit list more than 90 violations between January 2022 and June 2023 of the company's permit from the air quality district. Tesla attributed the causes nearly every time to \"unforeseen\" breakdowns and malfunctions, according to the records. The air quality district in its news release described Tesla's emissions as \"foreseeable.\" The Environmental Democracy Project targets pollution affecting communities of color. The City of Fremont describes itself as \"one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse cities in the Bay Area,\" with 63% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. U.S. Census data show the city's population is 62% Asian, 21% White, 12% Latino and 3% Black. In a March letter to Musk, the Environmental Democracy Project said it was planning to sue Tesla in federal court over its alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act because the air quality district had not done so already, \"leaving it to citizens like EDP to bring their own enforcement action.\" The nonprofit is seeking a court order barring Tesla from violating air quality regulations, and fines of up to $121,000 per day for each alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The Fremont factory, where Tesla makes its models 3, X, Y and S, has long been a target for regulatory and legal action. In February, eight Bay Area counties sued Tesla, claiming it illegally dumped produced in its Fremont plant and its auto service centers around the region. District attorneys in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma counties along with 17 other California DAs allege in San Joaquin County Superior Court that the company broke a host of laws on labeling, transportation and disposal of toxic materials. In a February 2022 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Tesla agreed to pay a $275,000 fine for breaking the Clean Air Act at the Fremont plant over a three-year period. Tesla in 2021 was fined $750,000 in a settlement with the air district for committing 33 air quality violations since 2015. In 2019, the company agreed to pay a $31,000 penalty over hazardous waste violations at the Fremont factory in another settlement with the U.S. EPA. Boyce believes the \"very small\" penalties are just \"the cost of doing business\" for Tesla. Musk has frequently defied and disparaged regulations and regulators and tweeted last year, \"Like Gulliver, tied down by thousands of little strings, we lose our freedom one regulation at a time.\" In 2018, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charge that he misled investors with a tweet about taking Tesla private—then he took to Twitter to mock the SEC. At the start of the COVID pandemic, Tesla kept the Fremont plant running for nearly a week in violation of a public health order, with Musk tweeting that an \"ignorant\" Alameda County health officer was violating \"our Constitutional freedoms.\"",

        "content": "Baxter. Courtesy of Midcoast Humane A gorgeous 6-year-old mix, Baxter came to Midcoast Humane from Oklahoma with an old injury to his front leg. Because it appeared to still be causing him discomfort, our medical team took X-rays and determined that removing the leg would be the best for Baxter’s long-term outcome. Now healed from his surgery, Baxter is ready for his new family! He has had a lot of transitions and he needs a home that understands it may take him a little while to settle in. Only having three legs doesn’t slow him down at all, and he’ll happily go for walks with you and then have a good snuggle on the couch. If Baxter sounds like he could be your boy, come on in to the Brunswick campus and ask to meet him! Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "AzmanJaka/E+ via Getty Images It has been a very long time since I covered shares of OSI Systems ( NASDAQ: OSIS ), in fact, it was the summer of 2016 when I concluded that appeal was increasing despite a somewhat troubled deal. Fast forwarding in time, OSI has seen solid growth and this has resulted in real value being delivered for its shareholders, all of which makes an update on the investment case long overdue. Fast forwarding some 8 years in time, OSI has seen continued growth. On a trailing basis, OSI has grown sales towards the $1.5 billion mark, aided by a couple of huge security orders in recent times. This created a strong 2024, although more orders keep the backlog flat here, creating interesting dynamics going forward, as not all segments are putting in their fair share here. Advanced, Reliable And Critical Electronics Solutions OSI provides advanced and reliable electronics solutions for critical applications across various diversified essential markets. The company is active across three segments which includes security, optoelectronics and healthcare. The security business is by far the largest segment, and the most profitable one, responsible for about 60% of sales. These revenues are generated from the development and manufacturing of security screening systems and solutions for governments, civil infrastructure, border & port security, among others. Optoelectronics is responsible for a quarter of sales, with revenues generated from components and solutions such as photodetectors, laser diodes and lex circuits in a wide range of applications. The remaining 15% of sales are generated in healthcare settings, including patient monitoring, cardiology, connected care and remote monitoring in various healthcare applications. In terms of geographies, half of sales are generated in the US, with the remainder generated notably in the EMEA region, APAC and the remainder of the Americas. When I last looked at the shares in 2016, the company had just completed a decade long period during which the company doubled its sales and grew adjusted earnings to $3 per share, while shares traded at a relatively modest $50 valuation. This was in part the result of shares falling at the time due to some operating hiccups, as the company announced a somewhat troubled acquisition as well. Between 2016 and today, the company has grown sales from around a billion to $1.3 billion in 2023, although that earnings doubled to $6 per share over this point in time. All this means that shares, which traded at $50 in 2016, have traded in a $50-$100 range all the way until the spring of last year. A $100 stock in the spring of last year was unleashed and rose to the $145 mark as of recent, actually trading at all-time highs here. Picking Up The Valuation Here In August of last year, OSI posted its fiscal 2023 results. Full year revenues were up 8% to $1.28 billion, aided by very strong results in the final quarter of last year when sales were up 22%. The company actually saw actual gross profitability down, as the company posted operating profits of $121 million, with the company posting GAAP earnings of $6.45 per share. That however included a one-time gain on the sale of property, with adjusted earnings of $5.81 per share actually being down forty cents on the year before. The company operated with net debt of $288 million, a very manageable amount. The company guided for a spectacular improvement in 2024 results, with revenues seen up more than 18%, with adjusted earnings seen up more than 25% on the year before. This was supported by a huge backlog, which rose some 46% to $1.8 billion after the company took in a few large orders, including a huge $600 million border inspection order from Mexico's Department of National Defense. In October of last year, the company posted first quarter results with sales up 4% to $279 million, with adjusted earnings up a modest four cents to $0.91 per share. While these results were not that spectacular, it prompted the company into hiking the full year earnings per share guidance, calling for more than 27% growth on an annual basis Second quarter sales were up some 26% to $373 million, with adjusted earnings up a dollar to $2.21 per share. Following this impressive quarter, the company now saw full year sales grow by more than 19%, with earnings per share growth seen in excess of 29%. In April, third quarter sales were reported up 34% to $405 million, with adjusted earnings up 45% to $2.16 per share. With earnings growth seen in excess of 30% per share here, earnings are expected to surpass $7.50 per share here. Given the greater earnings power here, net debt is down to about a quarter of a billion, as all this momentum is aided and supported by a continued backlog of $1.8 billion here. What Now? With 17.4 million shares of OSI trading at $145, equity of the company is valued at $2.52 billion, for a $2.77 billion enterprise valuation. This values the operations at less than 2 times sales with shares trading at 19 times earnings, after a great momentum run seen, with net leverage seen around 1.5 times. What is of interest is that here is great divergence between the segments. Irony will it that through the first nine months of the year, revenues for the optoelectronics and healthcare division are down, and the same applies for margins. This shows that all this momentum is driven by the security division, which has reported a 42% increase in sales so far this year to $700 million, pushing up its share to two-thirds of sales. This also shows the potential for other value accretive moves as the healthcare segment is barely profitable here, leaving potential for OSI to over time, become a more focused business, as the security business is notably the biggest, fastest growing business and also the most profitable segment out there. Amidst all this, I am performing a balancing act. A 19 times earnings multiple, given the organic growth performance, looks appealing, but arguably a few big orders have been driving 2024 growth. That said, after conversion of these orders one were to expect a decline in sales next year, but the backlog has been rather constant, as the order intake remains sound. This looks positive, but of course, growth has been rather dismal in recent years. Given this, I am performing a balancing act, but expect much tougher comparables here going forward. Given this, and the fact that shares have been doing quite well, having risen to fresh all-time highs here, I am leaning cautious here, anticipating some kind of normalization in fiscal 2025. On the other hand, there is potential for segments outside the security business to create value here as well, and despite the interesting dynamics and set-up, I am quite cautious and not willing to chase the shares here.

        "content": "A man died after I didn't speak up, and I still feel guilty about it, says DR SCURR. But second opinions aren't enough to save lives - it's the culture of hospitals that has to change By Dr Martin Scurr Published: 11:55 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:41 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares View comments The tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills following poor, possibly negligent care at a major London hospital brought back bitter memories of the death of one of my own patients. It also confirmed for me why, sadly, the plan to introduce Martha’s rule — which would give every patient in hospital the right to a second opinion from other experts at the same hospital — won’t help. In February, the Government announced that hospitals in England were to be offered funding to roll out the rule. Already 143 have signed up, it was reported today, and should be operating the scheme by 2025. Martha’s parents have been heroic in their efforts to try to spare others the awful, needless loss of a loved one . Martha's rule follows the tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died after developing sepsis in 2021 under the care of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South London But Martha’s rule, while laudable, cannot, I am afraid, do one thing that’s vital to its success: and that is to change our hospital culture . I don’t mean just that people are afraid to speak up, to challenge the hierarchy of senior doctors, for that is still an issue (although it is improving, slowly). I mean the lack of continuity of care — no longer taking full responsibility for a patient for their whole hospital ‘journey’ — which came when the structure of hospital care changed from the late 1990s. There’s no doubt that when you have concerns, questioning the doctor is an entirely acceptable and justified approach. And it can save lives. I have never forgiven myself for not intervening more aggressively on one of my own patient’s behalf, with hindsight knowing that if I had, he would have survived. The only way to stop preventable deaths occurring in the NHS is to change our hospital culture, writes Dr Martin Scurr He’d taken himself to A&E — as in Martha’s case, to a top London hospital (although a different one) — on a Friday night with a high temperature, rigors (sweating and shivering) and severe pain down one side of his abdomen. Yes, he was nearly 90 and had type 2 diabetes and a history of heart surgery, but until the day he fell ill with a kidney infection, he’d been able to work — full time. Always dressed in a three-piece suit and the upright bearing of a gentleman, he was the image of how many of us would like to be seen at that seniority: elegant and cognitively intact. But when I went to the hospital to see him on the Monday afternoon after my morning appointments — with three days’ beard growth, desperately ill with developing sepsis, dehydrated and now slightly confused — he was lying parked in a corner bed, where he’d spent all weekend on a small dose of an antibiotic, by mouth: with sepsis he should have been on an antibiotic drip. I was worried about his state and I phoned the consultant (the ward staff were unhelpful, but I found the name of the consultant over the head of the bed). The consultant told me that as it was nearly 5pm, the patient would now be handed over to a new team. That was where I should have intervened — even though as just his GP, I had as much authority as any loved one. What my patient needed was immediate intensive care, but as I suspect many medics would do, I deferred to the hierarchy — I was treading on territory where I had no mandate, hoping instead that the consultant would inform the colleague who was about to take over, about my concern. But I should have stepped over that invisible line. For while those who cared for him in the real world knew this man in his normal, healthy and magnificent self, the hospital team clearly viewed him as a pre-terminal geriatric with a urinary infection. He died the next day having received minimal care with nobody keeping an eye on him to witness his rapid deterioration. I took his death very badly. I felt very guilty that I had not intervened more successfully. As I see it, a major contribution to this sort of tragedy is fragmentation of care — lack of continuity under one single hospital team. This is the result of the loss of the old system where care was provided by a traditional ‘firm’, a team headed by one or two consultants with senior registrars (just below the level of consultant), registrars, senior house officers (two to three years out of medical school) and housemen (recent graduates from medical school). Read More 'Changing the culture of the NHS': As Martha's Rule comes into force, what it means for you and your loved ones - and the complete list of hospitals already signed up In the old ‘firm’ system there was accountability going up through each level of the team: the most junior members saw the most of the patients and when things went badly, they aired their concerns with the next level up; for example, to the registrar, who may well discuss with the senior registrar, and at times the consultant was then involved. This might sound like a recipe for ‘group think’, a sort of mindless consensus of opinion — but my argument would be that the recurrent audit and introspection about whether the right action is being taken countered that. Also, it was not unheard of for a consultant or senior registrar to make a decision to ask another team to come and have a look — a sort of joint team meeting. The sense of responsibility of the firm meant you would often see the senior doctors pop in on the weekend if they were worried about a particular patient. But in my patient’s case, the old type of ‘firm’ had long gone (the victim of the shift in power to management and new restrictions on working hours). It was a weekend and so there was probably only one harassed junior doctor around, there was no Saturday ward round, probably nobody came to see my patient at all unless maybe one of the nursing team called the duty doctor to come along, who may have then shrugged their shoulders and noted that this was an old person on their way out... The old tight-knit team — caring for patients right through the duration of their period of treatment, holding full responsibility — has evolved into what we have now, with experience and increasing responsibility (and full accountability) lost. We will never get the genie back into the bottle and no amount of increased regulation or Care Quality Commission inspections and sanctions can possibly achieve the diligence of the past. Nor will a legal framework, Martha’s rule, enforcing the option of a second opinion when requested. Despite its undoubtedly good intentions, driven by such heartbreaking and needless tragedy, I believe that such a rule will be a non-starter: fiddling while Rome burns.

Eyebrows were raised when the Magpies made the trip Down Under just days after the conclusion of a long season with a summer of international football ahead. Newcastle beat Tottenham on penalties in a friendly in Melbourne before seeing a second string XI get hammered 8-0 by an A-League All Stars team just two days later. Few could see the justification of the two games on the other wise of the world with club legend Alan Shearer labelling it 'madness' and 'crazy'. And Staveley, who spent the weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix, admits she understands the concerns.

        "description": "Two Texas metropolitan areas were the only two in the country to experience price drops in the four weeks ending May 19, according to a recent Redfin report.",
        "content": "While house prices in the U.S. reached another record high during the four weeks ending May 19, , two metropolitan areas in Texas have seen them sliding down in the same time frame, going against national trend. San Antonio and Fort Worth experienced the biggest—and only—year-over-year median sale price decreases in the four weeks ending May 19, with drops of respectively -1 percent and -0.6 percent. As of April, the latest data available on Redfin's website, the median sale price of a home in San Antonio was , up 1.5 percent year-over-year; in Fort Worth, it was $330,000, down 2.9 percent compared to April 2023. In the four weeks ending on May 19, the median U.S. home sale price hit a record $387,600, up 4 percent compared to a year earlier—an all-time high. The national median asking price reached a record $420,250 in the same period, up 6.6 percent year-over-year—another all-time high. contacted Redfin for comment by email on Monday. The steady rise of the price of homes in the U.S., which followed a brief housing market correction between late summer 2022 and spring 2023, is mainly being driven by a historic shortage of homes in the country. But stubbornly high mortgage rates are also playing a role, pricing out aspiring homebuyers and discouraging homeowners from letting go of their lower-mortgage properties and putting them on the market. ​​\"Move-up buyers feel stuck because they're ready for their next house, but it just doesn't make financial sense to sell with current interest rates so high,\" said , a Redfin agent in tah, in a news release. \"The homeowners listing right now are often doing so because they need to: one of my clients is selling because of a family emergency, and another couple is selling because they had a baby and simply don't have enough room,\" he added. \"Buyers should take note that many of today's sellers are motivated; if a home doesn't have other offers on the table, offer under asking price and/or ask for concessions because many sellers are willing to negotiate.\" High housing costs have led to one of the biggest declines in home sales in three months, according to Redfin. In the four weeks ending May 19, home sales were down 4.2 percent year-over-year. In the previous four-week period, home sales were down 4.4 percent compared to a year earlier. Three of the top five metropolitan areas with the biggest year-over-year increases were in California. In Anaheim, California, the median sale price of a home increased by 20.1 percent; in San Jose, California, by 12.9 percent; and in Oakland, California, by 12.5 percent. The other two cities in the top five were Detroit, Michigan, which experienced an increase of 16.9 percent and West Palm Beach, Florida, where the median sale price of a home rose by 12 percent.

        "content": "A couple of days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the infamous \"mujra\" remark about the opposition INDIA bloc in Bihar during the Lok Sabha election campaign, former Bihar chief minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Rabri Devi on Monday hit back in the same coin. She didn't hesitate to ridicule PM Modi when journalists drew her attention to the remark. She said, as quoted by news agency , \"And what does Modi do? Play the tabla?\" Rabri Devi, RJD's founding president and Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife, stated that facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had “gone crazy and taken to blabbering\". On being asked to respond to a comment by PM Modi, who alleged that the INDIA bloc was receiving support from 'jihadis' sponsored by Pakistan, she said, \"If it is indeed so, what are the intelligence agencies doing? And before indulging in the dog whistle over Pakistan, they should remember one of their tallest leaders Lal Krishna Advani, who went on to become the deputy prime minister, was born in that country.\" What Asaduddin Owaisi said? Slamming the PM for making such comments, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the PM was doing a disco dance with China when the latter's troops reportedly captured around 2,000 square kilometres of the Indian territory. He took to X and wrote, \"@narendramodi Ji, you talked about Mujra, so Asaduddin Owaisi wants to ask you that for the last 3 years, China has occupied 2 thousand square kilometers of Indian land, Modi ji, you are not removing China, so were you doing Disco Dancing with China?\" \"Is this the type of language the prime minister should use? Does Modi think we do not have mouth to speak? ( ),\" Owaisi said. What PM Modi had said Addressing multiple poll rallies in Bihar, PM Modi attacked the INDIA bloc over the reservation issue and accused it of doing ‘mujra’ for the Muslim vote bank. \"I am giving the guarantee to Bihar SC, ST, OBC communities, till Modi is alive, I will not let them snatch away their rights. For Modi, the Constitution is supreme, for Modi, Babasaheb Ambedkar's sentiments are supreme... if the INDI alliance wants to accept the servitude of their vote bank, they are free to do so...if they want to perform mujra (dance), they are free to do... I will still stand with the SC, ST, and OBC reservations staunchly. ,\" he said. Following his comments, he was criticised by several opposition leaders, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav.

The Tanzanian Premier League season is approaching its end and, consequently, so is the attacking midfielder's time with Yanga, as things stand. The 28-year-old's contract at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium expires at the end of the campaign, and his team is seemingly desperate to keep hold of his services after he helped them tremendously both domestically and on the continent. The Ivory Coast-born attacker has 17 goals in the league and is vying for Golden Boot honours, and also has two goals and two assists in the 12 CAF Champions League matches he played in for his club. As such, Yanga want to retain the 12-cap Burkinabe's services, and club president Hersi Said is believed to have initiated negotiations over an extension, but so far, Aziz Ki has not put pen to paper on a new deal. According to , the reason for his reluctance to commit his future to Young Africans is because he is leaning towards a move outside of Tanzania, preferably South Africa. The record Tanzanian champions are believed to have made a lucrative offer for him to extend his stay, but Aziz Ki is believed to be more receptive to accepting a move to the PSL. In recent weeks, the Adjame native has been linked with possible moves to the likes Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, and given that he is approaching free agency, he has his destiny in his own hands.

        "content": "Holidaymakers in Menorca have been barred from its picturesque streets after fed up locals have taken to chaining them off. Residents in the whitewashed town of Binibeca Vell have blocked off some of their labyrinthine, Instagrammable streets which have earned it the title of the \"Mykonos of Spain\". Locals claim the small, cobbled streets have been flooded with tourists intruding on their private properties vying for the perfect holiday snap. Some claim rowdy tourists have even scaled balconies and entered their doorways. Thick ropes and chains with 'no pedestrians' signs have now been strung across some streets in a bid to keep out non-residents between 8pm and 11am. The small town of 500 people on the south of the Balearic island has become increasingly popular with tourists, with 800,000 annual visitors. The blockades are among a spate of drastic measures taken across popular destinations in Europe protesting against mass tourism. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly The town's stunning cobbled streets have been cordoned off to tourists ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) Binibeca residents are set to take a vote in August on whether to ban tourists altogether, The Telegraph reports. Head of the town's residents association Óscar Monge has accused Menorcan authorities of not doing enough to mitigate the impact of mass tourism. \"Binibeca is promoted by the administration and tourism companies, but what benefit do we get out of it?\" he said. \"We pay dearly for being the most potent tourist attraction in Menorca.\" Locals in Ibiza have taken to street protests over the number of boozed-up, partying tourists making life chaos for permanent residents, while graffiti in a Majorcan town left the stark message, \"tourist go home\". Meanwhile, thousands staged demonstrations in the Canary Islands last month over fears the influx of visitors is damaging the environment. The town receives 800,000 visitors a year despite only 500 permanent residents ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) A statement on Binibeca's website has already asked tourists not to visit in the evenings or early mornings, with pictures showing people splayed out across steps and even sitting in one resident's chair. Mr Monge previously told The Guardian the town was \"not a place of adventure\" but a \"private housing development\". Residents in the town were given nearly £13,000 by the Spanish government to deal with rubbish left by tourists, but it's understood the deal has not been renewed. Some 1.2million people live permanently on the Balearics, which consists of Menorca, Majorca, and party hotspot Ibiza. The figure of full-time residents however is outnumbered dramatically by the 18million who visited in 2023 - a record-high for the archipelago.",

        "content": "Alexander Zverev scripted history at the Philippe-Chatrier Court after beating Spanish ace Rafael Nadal at the French Open . The German star claimed a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory in the first round to knock out Nadal. Notably, Zverev has become only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. The latter, who owns 14 Roland Garros titles, returned to Paris after batting successive injuries. Here are the match stats Zverev won a total of 112 points and 44 winners throughout the match. He served eight aces compared to Zverev's two. The German had a win percentage of 58 and 48 in the first and second serves, respectively. Nadal won 19 of his 21 net points. Both Nadal and Zverev recorded 30 unforced errors. They registered three double-faults each. Third man to beat Nadal at French Open Before this match, Nadal had only lost to Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic at the French Open. Soderling defeated him in the fourth round in 2009, while Djokovic remains the only player to defeat Nadal twice in the tournament (quarter-finals, 2015 and semi-finals, 2021). Between 2015 and 2021, Nadal was unbeaten in as many as 35 matches at the French Open. Fourth Roland Garros defeat for Nadal Nadal now has a win-loss record of 112-4 at Roland Garros. He has been knocked out for the first time before the fourth round. Notably, the Spaniard also holds the record for winning 39 consecutive French Open matches. It is worth noting that Nadal won four French Open titles without losing a set (2008, 2010, 2017, and 2020), the most for a player. 14-time French Open winner Nearly two decades after winning his maiden Grand Slam title, Nadal owns a total of 14 French Open honors (2005-2008, 2010-2014, 2017-2020, and 2022). The Spaniard has won eight more Roland Garros titles than Bjorn Borg , who owns six titles (second-most). Nadal also holds the record for winning most titles at a Grand Slam and on a single surface (clay). Unwanted numbers for Nadal As per Opta , this was only the second instance of Nadal trailing by two sets to 0 at the French Open, after the quarter-finals in 2015, whre he lost to Novak Djokovic. Notably, Nadal won nine of his previous 11 matches at the French Open after having lost the first set. Zverev coming off title in Rome As mentioned, Zverev became the third player to claim a French Open win over Nadal, who has faced 74 different opponents at this event. Notably, the German is coming off a title-winning run at Rome Masters. Earlier this year, he lost the Australian Open semi-final to Daniil Medvedev . Zverev is now 29-9 on the ATP Tour in 2024.",

        "description": "Ottawa flaunts a variety of cool cultural attractions and outdoor adventure experiences, plus a surprisingly good food scene and great drinking establishments.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Whitewater kayaking or rafting on the Ottawa River is a totally unique way to discover Canada's ... [+] national capital. (Photo by David E. Klutho) Between Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City, Canada boasts four amazing urban areas that should be on everyone’s travel bucket list. Now it’s time to add a fifth — Ottawa . That may seem like an odd choice. Without doubt, it’s a bastion of bureaucrats, politicians and government agencies. Normally the recipe for a bland or boring visitor experience. Yet Ottawa bucks the trend with a variety of cultural attractions and outdoor adventure experiences, plus a surprisingly good culinary scene — and maybe you can blame the politicians for this last one — great drinking establishments. Located around halfway between Toronto and Montreal, Canada’s national capital sprawls along the south side of the Ottawa River in eastern Ontario , and as such lies on the cusp of both English and French speaking Canada. Yet Ottawa never would have made the leap from backwoods outpost to big city if it wasn’t for widespread paranoia that the Americans wanted to make British Canada part of their new United States. Fearing a Yankee invasion of the St. Lawrence River valley, the Canadians created the Rideau Canal as a watery bypass in case of war. Located at the confluence of the canal and the Ottawa River, it wasn’t long before Bytown (as it was called then) began to boom. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone When her Canadian subjects couldn’t decide on a national government location, Queen Victoria intervened and named Ottawa as the capital in 1857. Yet it’s only recently — thanks to a bevy of new experiences and attractions — that Ottawa has burst onto the global tourism scene. Navigating the Rideau Canal between Parliament Hill and the Fairmont Chateau Laurier. Outdoor Adventure in an Urban Setting Ottawa makes great use of its riverside location with a range of ways to work up a sweat. One of the most thrilling is Interzip , a 1,200-foot-long double zipline that whisks riders 120 feet above the Ottawa River at a speed of around 25 miles per hour. Farther upstream, Wilderness Tours offers guided whitewater trips in rafts, kayaks and sportyak flexible one-person dinghies on the Ottawa River. The aquatic adventures range from low to extreme intensity, and there’s also flatwater tubing for those who prefer it slow and easy. One of the coolest ways to explore Ottawa is scooting around town on a muscle-powered or electric bike. Escape Bicycle Tours on the Sparks Street pedestrian mall rents various types of bikes and scooters, and offers guided cycling tours that include Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall park, and two bridge crossings over the Ottawa River. Running right through the middle of the city, the historic Rideau Canal provides plenty of scope for outdoor fun. The Rideau Canal Eastern Pathway , a leafy hiking and biking trail, stretches five miles between the Senate Building and Prince of Wales Falls. Or hire a cabin cruiser at Le Boat on Dow’s Lake for overnight voyages down the Rideau Canal from Ottawa into the Ontario wilderness. T-Rex ambush in the dinosaur gallery at the Canadian Museum of Nature. Indoor Art and Adventures Located in the castle-like Victoria Memorial Building, the Canadian Museum of Nature offers a cutting-edge glimpse of the nation’s incredibly diverse flora, fauna and geology. With many hands-on exhibits and a dinosaur gallery with more than 200 specimens, the museum is ideal for families with children. Over on the art side, the National Gallery of Canada runs all the way from the Renaissance and Baroque through Impressionism 20 th -century Canadian and American painters and sculptors. Designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the gallery is an artwork all on its own. And don’t forget to snap a selfie with Maman , the giant metal and marble spider by artist Louise Bourgeois out front. Duck into the Canadian Senate and House of Commons on Parliament Hill on short, guided tours, or a self-guided (free) immersive experience that includes a 360° multimedia show. Even if you don’t go inside, scan the lofty Peace Tower for stone gargoyles and grotesque human figures. Ottawa’s most unusual indoor attraction is on the outskirts of the city and underground — Diefenbunker: Canada's Cold War Museum . Between 1961 when it was completed and 1994 when it was decommissioned, the massive, four-story concrete bunker was a fallout shelter where the Canadian government would take refuge in case of a nuclear attack. One-hour guided tours cover the bunker’s history and highlights. Colorful cocktails at Stolen Goods. Ottawa Eats and Sleeps Sure you can get poutine, butter tarts and salmon steak. But the city’s culinary scene has grown increasingly diverse, restaurants that focus on various global cuisines or modern Canadian cooking. One of the hottest tables in town is Riviera on Sparks Street. The menu offers modern takes on Canadian favorites like smoked duck breast, Alberta sirloin steak, steelhead trout and Newfoundland codfish and mussels in a revitalized Art Deco interior that was once a bank. Slated to open later this year, Antheia restaurant is the latest creation from chef and owner Briana Kim, who won top prize at the 2023 Canadian Culinary Championship with her innovative takes on vegetarian and vegan foods. Ethnic eats step into the limelight in the Byward Market neighborhood, which includes the historic redbrick market pavilion (built in the 1920s) and surrounding streets. The selection ranges from dim sum and Southeast Asian street food at Sidedoor and classic Canadian-style shawarma at Three Brothers to Indian cuisine at Shafali Bazaar and tasty leaves from around the planet at Teastore . Ottawa’s best new bar is Stolen Goods , a tiny cocktail lounge on Sparks Street with a racoon mascot, delicious seafood snacks and offbeat drinks like the Three Brothers vegan gimlet and the Jungle Adventures tropical cocktail with Fruit Loops foam. Unveiled in 1912 as one of Canada’s elegant railway hotels, the Fairmont Château Laurier remains the iconic place to overnight in Ottawa. Located beside Parliament Hill and the Rideau Canal, it affords an ideal base to explore the city by foot or bike. If modern designer-savvy is more your style, book a room with a view at the high-rise Le Germain Hotel , which is right beside the Ottawa Art Gallery and walking distance to Byward Market. Or go totally homey at the Auberge King Edward Bed & Breakfast , in a 1902 Victorian manse between Ottawa University and Byward Market. Halibut with clams and fava beans at Riviera restaurant.

        "content": "The Texas A&M baseball team’s path to Omaha will run through College Station. The Aggies were selected as the No. 3 overall seed in the NCAA tournament Monday, and will have the opportunity to play on their home field the first two weekends of the postseason. A&M (44-13) will face fourth-seeded Grambling (26-26) on Friday at noon on ESPN+. Texas is the No. 3 seed in the Bryan-College Station Regional and will face second-seeded Louisiana on Friday at 5 p.m. on ESPNU. The regional round is a four-team, double-elimination format. The winner of the regional advances to the super regional round where the winner of the best-of-3 series moves onto the eight-team College World Series. A&M's regional is paired with No. 14 overall seed UC-Santa Barbara, which is hosting Oregon, San Diego and Fresno State. This will be the third time A&M has been paired with rival Texas in a regional during the schools' 13-year hiatus as conference foes. The Aggies were eliminated by the Longhorns in the 2014 Houston Regional final and lost to the Longhorns in a winner's bracket game in the 2018 Austin Regional. A&M beat Texas 9-2 this season on March 5 in a midweek game played in Austin. The Longhorns are 35-22 overall this season and were 20-10 in Big 12 Conference play. A&M is 2-0 all-time vs. Grambling. The schools last met in 2013. The Aggies are 14-9 all-time vs. Louisiana. The Cajuns were in the College Station Regional in 2022. The Aggies beat the Cajuns in a winner's bracket game. In 2007, A&M came through the loser's bracket and beat Louisiana twice in one day to advance to the super regionals. The Aggies learned Sunday night they would host a regional for the 13th time in school history. This marks the highest seed in program history as the Aggies earned a national seed for the fourth time. The NCAA announced the Aggies would be a top-four seed on Monday morning. Tennessee, which won the Southeastern Conference regular and tournament titles, is the No. 1 seed. Kentucky is the No. 2 overall seed. Success in conference play and an undefeated nonconference record helped the Aggies secure a high seed despite losing two of their last three conference series and going 0-2 in the SEC tournament. The Aggies get to return home, though, where they are 32-3 this season. Should A&M advance, it would get to play on its home field in the super regional round as it pursues an eighth appearance in the College World Series. The last time A&M was an NCAA tournament host was 2022 when the Aggies earned the No. 5 seed and went unbeaten in the regional and super regional rounds en route to the College World Series.

        "content": "Decision soon on Enzo Maresca to Chelsea plus update on other candidates We keep hearing so many stories about the Chelsea manager situation, which is normal of course after the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, and with so many other clubs also changing managers this summer, but I wanted to clarify some things here. As things stand, Ruben Amorim is not in talks with Chelsea – my understanding is that he is not a candidate as Chelsea would prefer someone with experience of working in English football. So, despite rumours, Amorim is not holding talks over the Chelsea job. Kieran McKenna also looks to be out of the running now, though he’s also wanted by Brighton and they’re waiting for his decision. They want an answer from him soon as they search for a replacement for Roberto de Zerbi. Finally, Xavi has also been linked with the Chelsea job but again I’m not hearing anything concrete on that one. Xavi is open to opportunities after leaving Barcelona, but at the moment it’s all quiet there and I have no news on any talks taking place or being planned with Chelsea. So, the situation is that Chelsea are interested in Enzo Maresca and he’s also interested in the Chelsea job after positive contacts took place over the weekend. It’s now up to Chelsea – decision time is coming soon, and Leicester are waiting to see what happens there before they then decide on who to hire as a replacement. Sofyan Amrabat drops hint over future but it could depend on the manager situation While there has understandably been a lot of talk about the Manchester United manager situation, with Erik ten Hag’s future recently looking about 50-50 for him to stay or leave Old Trafford, there was also another interesting story to follow after the Red Devils’ FA Cup final win over Manchester City. Sofyan Amrabat had a good game for United and spoke afterwards to hint that he could still end up staying at the club. However, my understanding is that nothing has been communicated to Fiorentina or the player side yet. It will depend also on the manager situation, so it will be part of the review that Man United will do this week. In January, Juventus and Barcelona were interested but Man United never opened doors for Amrabat to leave. Liverpool have scouted Leny Yoro but Lille’s asking price will be important One of the top young centre-backs in Europe right now and one to watch on the market is Leny Yoro of Lille. I’ve reported on his future before, with a lot of interest, a lot of clubs scouting him, and now we’re seeing more reports and links about strong interest from Liverpool. As I’ve mentioned previously, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are absolutely in the race for Yoro. It’s also the case that Liverpool have been scouting him, but at the moment the situation is really based on what kind of price Lille will ask for – all clubs are basically waiting for that. Liverpool could strengthen at centre-back this summer, as I’ve reported before, but let’s see if this scouting and monitoring of Yoro turns into anything more concrete. For now, it’s just normal scouting of a top talent, and my understanding is that PSG and Real Madrid are very much in the race for his signature. Arsenal linked with left-back, plus possible exit It could be an important summer for Arsenal, but at the moment some of the we’re seeing may be a little premature. I’m aware, for example, of a lot of stories coming out involving Fenerbahce left-back Ferdi Kadioglu, but I don’t have concrete updates on that for the moment. Kadioglu is always been linked with several clubs – there have been stories about Aston Villa as well as Arsenal – but there is no news yet. A move to the Premier League is concrete possibility, but for now we have to wait a bit longer and see which club will really go for it. It’s also been reported that Fabio Vieira could leave Arsenal after a lack of playing time. My understanding, however, is that it depends on proposals. So far it’s quiet but for players like Vieira (not all of them) there’s a chance to leave in case of a good proposal coming in. We just have to be patient on that one.",

        "content": "Don't criticise Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer for asking Erik ten Hag proper questions. They rose above TV football's wasteland of vacuous chummery and prehistoric banter, writes OLIVER HOLT The BBC duo have been criticised for their post-FA Cup questions of Erik ten Hag But all criticism of their interview with the Man United boss should be laughed at Their second goal was one of the great FA Cup goals... Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Oliver Holt Published: 17:23, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:07, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Let me tell you what happened after the FA Cup Final finished and the BBC moved into the post-match phase of its coverage late on Saturday afternoon. It’s not complicated. Neither man fawned over Erik ten Hag after United’s shock victory over Manchester City . Neither man attempted to make him laugh with a lame joke because they were scared of angering him. Neither man ducked the responsibility of confronting the issue everyone was talking about. Neither of them took the easy way out of blaming ‘the media’ for the criticism that Ten Hag has received over recent months, a favourite of former athletes who have a habit of forgetting that they are now ‘the media’, too. Lineker and Shearer are superb broadcasters and both of them did their job as interviewers. They were respectful and polite towards Ten Hag but they are not wide-eyed kids talking to their heroes. Gary Lineker quizzed Erik ten Hag on his future in the immediate aftermath of Man United's FA Cup triumph Lineker and Shearer have defended themselves following criticism, insisting they did not overstep the mark The Dutchman's FA Cup victory means United have now won two trophies in two seasons under Ten Hag Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola? EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring 'It hasn't worked!' Is VAR the problem or the solution? EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify So they asked the questions they needed to ask, about why United, who finished eighth in the Premier League, had not played like this before. And whether Ten Hag knew if he would still be at the club next season. They were entirely legitimate questions. They many not have been the questions Ten Hag wanted to answer but that is irrelevant. READ MORE The secrets behind the success of Chelsea's next manager: Enzo Maresca has Johan Cruyff quotes as his WhatsApp profile image and even wrote a THESIS on tactics... but 'Diet Pep' will have to reign in his erratic behaviour It’s the BBC. It’s not a fan-channel. It’s not MUTV. It’s not Pravda. It’s not Sky Sports, whose reporters in the north east, for example, boast about being fans first. Lineker and Shearer asked the questions we should expect to be asked by a competent broadcast network. And then, because television audiences in this country have been force-fed a diet of vacuous, flaccid, tame post-match interviews for too long, because they have grown used to that diet, Lineker and Shearer were roundly criticised for their conduct towards Ten Hag. They were accused of being disrespectful, aggressive, rude, of not letting Ten Hag enjoy his moment. All those accusations should be laughed out of town. For a start, if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the United minority owner, had simply said Ten Hag’s job was safe and that he would be the manager next season, no one would have needed to ask Ten Hag the question. Ratcliffe has let him swing. And if Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions about his job prospects at Old Trafford, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence. A previous regime at United sacked Louis van Gaal the day after he won the FA Cup for the club in 2016. It’s not much of a stretch to ask Ten Hag, who presided over a dismal league season, if he fears the same fate. Part-owners INEOS - headed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) are expected to make a decision on Ten Hag's future this week Ten Hag's future is yet to be decided as United chiefs weigh up whether to terminate his contract early United's majority owner Avram Glazer (right) looked delighted as he shook hands with Ten Hag at Wembley So the criticism of Lineker and Shearer is pathetic. What is wrong with a robust question, anyway? Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work. They were supposed to wait, apparently, and let Ten Hag enjoy his moment. Television doesn’t work like that. News doesn’t work like that. And football doesn’t work like that. The question has to be asked when the man is in front of you or it will not be asked at all. The absurd reaction to the interview hinted at a bigger picture: the arid landscape of the post-match, post-fight, post-race television interview has been allowed to become, over the past few years in this country, a wasteland of gurning ingratiation, vacuous chummery and self-congratulatory, prehistoric lad-banter. The BBC’s coverage of the Olympic Games often sets the gold standard in this hyperventilating medium where being friends with an athlete appears to be valued above all else, sycophancy is a pre-requisite and looking the other way when bad things happen – particularly if it happens to British competitors - is non-negotiable. United endured a miserable second season in the Premier League under Ten Hag as they finished eighth United's FA Cup victory - their 13th in the competition - might have given Ten Hag a lifeline Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work Every viewer is different. We all value different qualities in our interviewers. For those of us who value insight over jocularity and prefer our analysts to analyse rather than throw themselves into the arms of a former teammate as they leave the pitch or the track, sober, serious, intelligent interviewers like Gabriel Clarke are increasingly hard to locate in the genre. READ MORE It would now seem MAD to sack Erik ten Hag: OLIVER HOLT explains why this FA Cup final is different to Louis van Gaal's Wembley last hurrah It is a failed state peopled increasingly by those so dazzled by the light of the game, which they recognise instinctively as the light that once shone from them, that they are incapable of any meaningful interaction with interviewees beyond the non-negotiable imperative of establishing that they, too, once were warriors. So, the exceptions to the rule, when they come, are even more welcome. There are many of these exceptions, by the way. Too many to mention here but it was a particular treat to listen to the radio show hosted by Jim White and Simon Jordan on TalkSport last week and hear their conversation with the boxing promoter, Frank Warren. If Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence For 20 minutes or so, they engaged in an argument about Tyson Fury, one of Warren’s fighters, who had lost an epic world heavyweight title battle with Oleksandr Usyk a few days earlier. Some might call it a row. Both sides stood their ground in an articulate, passionate exchange of views. It was utterly compelling. Nobody won or lost. Neither Warren, nor Jordan gave ground. Both stuck to their arguments and maintained their loyalties and their opinions. Again, it was the kind of conversation that happens far too rarely. Jack Stephens showed his true leadership values against Leeds I went to the Leeds United-Southampton Championship play-off final on Sunday. It was a brilliant atmosphere but it wasn’t the best game. Southampton deserved to win. They had one chance and they took it. But the thing that made the biggest impression on me all afternoon happened after the final whistle. As the Southampton players sprinted away towards their fans, I looked over at the other end of the stadium where the Leeds players had collapsed to the turf in despair. Saints captain Jack Stephens consoled Leeds players immediately after Southampton's victory in the Championship play-off final Stephens (left) showed his true leadership qualities as Southampton were promoted at Wembley Jack Stephens, the Southampton captain, had not run to celebrate with his club’s supporters and his teammates. Instead, he made his way from one Leeds player to another, consoling them, hugging them, lifting them from the floor. In the melee, Stephens’ leadership shone through. IShowSpeed is football's new publicity mogul I didn’t think anyone could make more publicity off the back of football than Salt Bae. IShowSpeed is proving me wrong. Chelsea's appalling track record Good luck to Enzo Maresca, or whoever it is who takes hold of the poisoned chalice that is the Chelsea job these days. Chelsea have moved a step closer to appointing Leicester's Enzo Maresca as their new boss Given that the manager at the club is now expected to be, in many ways, a subservient part of the hierarchy, it will be interesting to know if the first to pay the price for the next failure at Stamford Bridge will be the manager or the sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, who seem to be higher up the food chain. Their record so far has been appalling but there is only so long, surely, that they will be able to wield power without taking responsibility.

        "content": "The 17 'red flag' colorectal cancer symptoms young people need to look out for, according to study of 25million patients READ MORE: You should get a colonoscopy if you have two common symptoms By Emily Joshu Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 15:51, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:51, 27 May 2024 e-mail 29 View comments A major study has revealed the 17 most common symptoms of the fastest growing cancer in young people. Colorectal cancer diagnoses in people under 50 were most often preceded by rectal bleeding, stomach pain, and changes in bowel movements. Unexpected weight loss , fatigue, changes to appetite and other digestive issues were among the most common symptoms associated with the disease. Researchers in six countries including the US made the finding after analyzing data from more than 80 studies, which included nearly 25million colorectal cancer patients under 50. Young patients are being urged to get checked if they suffer any of these symptoms because they are not routinely screened for the disease. The above table shows the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The above graph shows colon cancer cases among under 50s by year. There is a drop in 2020 because the Covid pandemic led to fewer people coming forward for screenings The finings come as colorectal cancer rates are expected to double from 2010 to the end of the decade . Doctors are still trying to work out what's behind the rapid rise. Processed foods, chemical contamination and the overuse of antibiotics have all been touted as possible factors. 'Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as a diagnosis at younger than age 50 years, is increasing, and so-called red flag signs and symptoms among these individuals are often missed, leading to diagnostic delays,' the researchers wrote. 'Improved recognition of presenting signs and symptoms associated with EOCRC could facilitate more timely diagnosis and impact clinical outcomes.' The research team used the data to determine which symptoms were most common, which signs put patients most at risk of colon cancer, and how long it took patients to get a colon cancer diagnosis. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: health@dailymail.com Advertisement They found that rectal bleeding was linked to a five-fold increase in early onset colon cancer risk, making it the largest risk factor. Additionally, one in 10 patients had their symptoms come on quickly and severely . The researchers initially combed through 12,859 research papers and narrowed down the list to 81 studies conducted between 2000 and 2023. They found that 45 percent of patients experienced rectal bleeding or blood in their stool, and 40 percent suffered abdominal pain. Additionally, 27 percent had changes in their bowel habits, which could include having more or fewer movements. Weight loss was seen in 17 percent of patients, while 15 percent had a loss of appetite. And while 12 percent had an acute presentation, meaning their symptoms came on quickly, it took an average of four to six months for them to get a diagnosis. 'Younger patients may experience ongoing signs and symptoms and delay seeking medical attention,' the researchers wrote. 'Potential reasons for these delays include a patient believing they are too young to worry about cancer or a lack of access to primary care of health insurance.' Rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movements are the key signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The researchers looked at 81 studies to determine the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people. They found that rectal bleeding or blood in the stool was the most common sign Rates of GI cancers rose most sharply in the youngest age group, followed by the 20-29 year old cohort. There were also more cases of GI cancers among older people, though in that case it is still considered early-onset cancer And even if a patient does seek medical help, 'patients and clinicians alike may downplay symptom severity and fail to recognize key red flags and clinical cues that should trigger suspicion of colorectal cancer,' the team said. They noted that, too often, rectal bleeding, the most common sign, is attributed to harmless conditions like hemorrhoids. A 2020 survey from Colorectal Cancer Alliance , for example, found that 68 percent of patients experienced blood in their stool, and many of them were misdiagnosed or dismissed. Read More EXCLUSIVE 'If we can get colon cancer, anyone can': These three patients were 45 and in the 'best shape of their lives' when they were diagnosed with 'death sentence' disease - now they're issuing a plea to young people More than half of the participants said they were misdiagnosed with conditions such as hemorrhoids, IBS, anemia, and mental health issues. Patients ages 19 to 39 were the most likely to feel dismissed, the team found. Alarmingly, these are the age groups that colon cancer is rising the quickest in. Recent statistics suggest that colon cancers have grown by 500 percent in children ages 10 to 14 and 333 percent in teens ages 15 to 19. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 106,590 cases of colon cancer and 46,220 instances of rectal cancer this year, along with 53,010 deaths. It's currently the fourth most common cancer in the US behind lung, prostate, and breast cancers. And nearly one in four patients are diagnosed after the disease has already spread to other organs. Overall, 'delays in diagnostic workup after sign or symptom presentation are up to 40% longer compared with older individuals with colorectal cancer,' the researchers wrote. They advised doctors to work with patients to ensure they are diagnosed quickly. They also suggested patients should ask for a colonoscopy or stool test if they experience symptoms. The review was published last week in the journal JAMA Network Open .

        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders dismantled the batting powerhouse of Sunrisers Hyderabad for only 113 runs to set up an eight-wicket victory Sunday and a third Indian Premier League title. The $2.9 million signing Mitchell Starc rattled Hyderabad's top-order with 2-14, and all six Kolkata bowlers took wickets before the most aggressive batting team this season was bowled out for the lowest ever total in the history of IPL finals. Venkatesh Iyer then led Kolkata to 114-2 in 10.3 overs with a blazing 26-ball unbeaten 52. Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring 39 in 32. \"It was comprehensive,\" said Kolkata captain Shreyas Iyer, who also played in an IPL final for Delhi Capitals in 2020 when his team lost to Mumbai Indians. \"This is what we demanded from the players and they stood up. It's difficult to express the feelings, so much to cherish right now. There was no one individual who took us here, it was a cumulative effort, it was a flawless season for us.\" Kolkata previously won the IPL titles in 2012 and '14 and had dominated this season by finishing on top at the end of league stage with nine wins from 14 games. It even dominated the most aggressive Hyderabad batting lineup by winning both in the league stage and also in the qualifier, where Australian paceman Starc stood out before routing Pat Cummins' team in a one-sided final. Starc and Cummins will combine in Australia's squad at the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts Saturday with the United States taking on Canada in Dallas. The IPL gave some of the world's leading players time to prepare for the World Cup in the U.S. and Caribbean. The six-week tournament culminated with the final, and Cummins had first choice had winning the toss and deciding to bat. But the Sunrisers were deflated inside the first seven overs as they limped to 47-4 against an impeccable attack of Starc, Harshit Rana (2-24) and Vaibhav Arora (1-24). Starc started the rout when he clean bowled Abhishek Sharma with a ball that swung away from the left-hander and knocked back the off stump. Travis Head, who regularly scored quick runs for Hyderabad this season, edged Arora's first ball and went for a golden duck. At 6-2 in two overs, Hyderabad struggled to recover from that double loss. Starc's three-over spell in the power play gave Kolkata another wicket when Rahul Tripathi top-edged the left-arm quick. There was no power-hitting from the South African pair of Aiden Markram, who made a struggling 20 off 23 balls, and Heinrich Klaasen (16 in 17) as Kolkata kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Markram's weak pull shot against Andre Russell landed in the lap of Starc at long-on and Klaasen departed in the 15th over when he dragged Rana's off-cutter back onto his stumps. Russell mopped up the lower order with 3-19 and Hyderabad was in danger of not reaching 100 before Cummins hit 24 off 19 balls and was the last man dismissed in the penultimate over. \"Russell has got a magic wand and he is looking towards me to bowl,\" Shreyas Iyer said. \"In the majority of the games he gave us breakthroughs.\" Kolkata lost Sunil Narine before Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed three sixes and four boundaries, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz effectively sealed the game with some aggressive hitting in a 91-run stand. It was heartbreak for Hyderabad, which had toppled IPL batting records throughout the season and three times posted totals exceeding 265. However, it got bowled out for its lowest total of the season at a venue where Kolkata, owned by Bollywood celebrity Shah Rukh Khan, had happy memories of winning its first IPL title in 2012. \"We were outplayed,\" Cummins said. \"They didn't give us anything ... they bowled fantastically.\"",

        "content": "The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms' intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country's second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died for.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.

Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, says scientists and public health officials have known about avian influenza for decades. \"What's different today is that since 2020, we're seeing the largest outbreak of avian influenza among wild birds , poultry and backyard bird flocks,\" he says. \"The virus has also been found in certain mammalian species , most recently in dairy cattle, which is a little bit unprecedented and unique. And every time we see the virus go from birds into mammals, we worry about the virus adapting closer and closer to being able to infect and be transmitted efficiently between humans,\" Dr. Binnicker says. Bird flu has been detected in the milk of dairy cattle , raising concerns for potential transmission to humans. The Food and Drug Administration found no traces of live virus in dairy products available to the public. \"The good news is that the pasteurization process used in the United States and many countries inactivates avian influenza. The milk that we drink, if it's been pasteurized, is safe. Any animal products, such as eggs, beef or chicken, that you would cook to the recommended internal temperature renders that product safe to eat,\" says Dr. Binnicker. There are steps people can take to ensure their food remains safe from any viral or bacterial pathogen. \"As with any potential infectious disease associated with food, cooking to the recommended internal temperature that the CDC lists on their website is really important. And if you do that, you inactivate viruses like influenza, you inactivate bacteria and parasites that could cause a human infection,\" says Dr. Binnicker. The CDC recommends using a food thermometer to ensure foods are cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature. Always wash your hands with soap and water, and disinfect cooking surfaces when handling raw or uncooked meat and poultry. Dr. Binnicker says millions of birds have been infected with avian influenza, and the risk to humans remains low because the virus hasn't adapted to humans at this time. He recommends precautions for those who spend time outdoors or work with birds. \"If you're interacting with birds, either through a backyard bird flock or a poultry farm, and there are birds that are either sick or have died, you need to wear an N95 mask. You need to wear eye protection and gloves,\" says Dr. Binnicker. \"Most importantly, you need to contact your state or local public health officials so that they're aware of what's going on in your poultry facility or backyard bird flock.\" The bird flu doesn't normally infect people, but some rare cases have happened. Infection can range from no symptoms to mild illness (like pink eye) to very serious and even deadly, according to the CDC. \"If you come down with symptoms, especially after interacting with a sick or dead bird, get tested for influenza and let your doctor and local public health officials know,\" he says. \"The good news is that influenza tests that we currently use for human strains of influenza should be positive if an individual is infected with avian influenza. The current tests just won't tell us specifically that an individual has avian influenza .\" The CDC is working with diagnostic test manufacturers and clinical laboratories to develop tests to specifically determine if it's avian flu. Dr. Binnicker says those tools should be available in the months ahead.",

        "content": "OKLAHOMA CITY ( KFOR ) – A local public charter school is introducing kids in a land locked state to water sports, by launching a rowing team. It will be available this fall for middle school students. While rowing isn’t easy, it is one of many sports that teaches team work. KIPP OKC College Prep Athletic Director David Duplissis plans to be the coach, while his son Dillon and student Carlos Williams plan to be on the team. The soon to be eighth graders are hoping the workouts they did on the rowing machines Friday can translate to when they do the real thing in the fall. LOCAL NEWS: RIVERSPORT offering free learn to row day “Just giving the opportunity to be exposed and create opportunities for kids that they normally wouldn’t have,” David Duplissis said. In April, students like Williams and Duplissis got to take part in RIVERSPORT’s Outdoor Adventure Education Research, or ROVER, program. While, they got to do a ton of activities, rowing stood out to them. Local public charter school starts rowing team. Image courtesy RIVERSPORT Adventures.

From there, a rowing team was born. This spring, they met every Tuesday for practice. “They enjoyed every bit of it,” David Duplissis said. They plan to take part in Junior League. It’s competition Duplissis hopes can teach kids lessons. “Resiliency, risk management, and, you know, just a holistic view of helping a child succeed in life,” he said.

While most sculptures appear static this is a kaleidoscope of movement. Nadal is depicted with left leg in the air, left arm wrapped around his body in a forehand, and mouth open in that primal snarl of effort. That is how he will be remembered, not as the man who was beaten in straight sets by 27-year-old Alexander Zverev on Philippe Chatrier; not as this shadow of the titan he once was. But this defeat – only his fourth here in 19 years and his first in the opening round - will form part of his legacy nonetheless. It is one thing to fight towards victory, quite another to scrap in the face of almost certain defeat. He saved 12 break points and a run of shotmaking brought him close to snatching the second set. It was comfortably his best performance of this, almost certainly the final season of his career. But Zverev is younger, fitter and more powerful and sometime sport is as simple as that. The German No 4 seed joins Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic as the only men to have beaten Nadal at the French Open . He should absolutely be counted among the favourites for this title. Rafael Nadal's French Open swansong came to an early end after his first-round knockout Nadal went down in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in what may be his final year on tour 'I don't know if it's the last time I will be here,' said Nadal, 37. 'It's so special for me to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most. 'I was competitive I had my chances but it was not enough against a great champion like Sacha. 'To the people here, the feelings you have made me feel are unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.' This was an emotionally significant match for Zverev, too. It was here against Nadal in the 2022 semi-finals when a knife edge match was ended by a horrific ankle injury. He has just this year begun to fully rebuild from that and Zverev will feel like this win finally laid those ghosts to rest. That this was the most anticipated men's first-round match in history was demonstrated by those in the crowd. Nadal was watched on court by his greatest rival Novak Djokovic and the heir to his Spanish throne Carlos Alcaraz and his successor as the most dominant player at Roland Garros, Iga Swiatek. Alcaraz stayed the longest. He was asked in a video this week to name his favourite tennis player. 'Rafa is my favourite everything,' he replied. Zverev inflicted only Nadal's fourth French Open defeat and his first ever in the first round The legendary Spaniard fought valiantly under the closed roof on Court Philippe Chatrier Zverev looked a little cowed at times by the febrile atmosphere. He was clumsy around the net and wasteful of opportunities but he landed 77 per cent of his first serves and struck 44 winners. He punctured Nadal's defences with his majestic backhand and broke him six times. In the end, the layers of Nadal's genius had been stripped away until that famous aura was all that remained. And that aura matters. It has won him sets, matches and perhaps even titles here and it probably saved him from a more embarrassing scoreline against Zverev. But an aura cannot hit forehands and it cannot make returns - and it is in those fundamental currencies of the sport that Nadal is now lacking. Especially in the first half of the match, there was spin on the forehand but no depth, no venom. The backhand did not have its usual penetration. The Spaniard said before this match that he was feeling fully fit for the first time since his comeback at the start of the year, and this was a much improved performance compared to his struggles on the clay so far this season. He will curse the fact that he was not able to rebuild physically sooner, and come into Roland Garros with more matches in his legs. But what a legacy he leaves here. He has dominated this corner of Paris's 16th arrondisement in a manner that is without parallel – not just in tennis but surely in any sport. He fought Zverev, the No 4 seed, after dropping down the rankings due to infrequent play All being well, Nadal will be back on the same court for the Olympics later this summer He will finish – if this is indeed to be the end – with a 112-4 record at this tournament. I would argue he has never lost here when fully fit. He arrived here as a 19-year-old in 2005 and won the title on debut. The hair was longer, the shorts baggier and the sleeves non-existent. He has the kid who could get any ball back and never made a mistake. But what has given Nadal the record he has is his indefatigable greed for improvement. When he first began playing here his serve was little more than a way to get the point started but he reforged it into a powerful weapon. He became more aggressive, and turned himself into, for my money, the best volleyer in the world (sorry, Roger). With those improvements he became the complete package. Not just the best clay court player there has ever been but the best that could possibly be imagined. All being well, Nadal will be back on this court for the Olympics, playing the singles and the doubles with Alcaraz. But at the French Open, this was surely the end.

        "description": "The insurer aims to focus on topline growth FY25",
        "content": "By Anshika Kayastha Comments READ LATER Life Insurance Corporation of India posted a net profit of 13,763 crore in Q4, up only 2.5 per cent year-on-year, as a 15.3 per cent jump in expenses of management to ₹24,709 crore for the quarter weighed on the bottomline. In the earnings call, CFO Sunil Agrawal said there was a sharp increase in expenses of management in Q4 due to the wage revision impact in Q4, which includes arrears of payments, gratuity and leave encashmant and pension liability. The arrears and gratuity have been completely accounted for in Q4 whereas the pension liability will be amortised over financial years. LIC had changed its accounting policy in September 2022, regarding transfer of accretion on available solvency margin from Non-Participating Policyholders account to Shareholders account. Accordingly, it transferred ₹29,519 crore (net of tax) in FY24 compared with ₹27,241 crore in the previous year, which supported profitability. The transfer for Q4 was ₹8,058 crore against ₹4,542 crore in the year-ago period. Also read: Mukesh Ambani weighs listing RJio first The profit after tax for FY24 was at ₹40,676 crore, 11.8 per cent higher y-o-y. The life insurer sold total of 2.0 crore individual policies in FY24, 0.2 per cent lower on year. Overall expense ratio for FY24 was 15.6 per cent compared with 15.5 per cent for FY23. Total premium income for FY24 was ₹4.8-lakh crore, marginally higher than ₹4.7-lakh crore in FY23. Individual business premium grew 3.8 per cent to Rs 3.0 lakh crore, whereas the group business premium income fell 5.5 per cent to ₹1.7-lakh crore. “During FY24, we focused on directional changes in our product mix and enhancing margins in the business. We have more than doubled our share of non-par business within our individual business. Now, we intend to focus our strategic interventions to maximize our market share across categories,” said Chairperson Siddhartha Mohanty, adding that the focus will also be on the topline growth trajectory. Post listing, LIC had adopted some directional changes in approach to business, particularly product mix, with a focus on high margin products. Due to this margins have improved but topline has been muted, which is why the insurer will focus on growing the topline without losing sight on margins, Mohanty said adding that topline growth will be driven by multiple projects been undertaken including one for transformation of the agency channel, and the launch of new products. Value of New Business (VNB) was up 4.7 per cent for FY24 at ₹9,583 crore. Net VNB margin increased 60 bps to 16.8 per cent. Total premium, on Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) basis, rose 0.5 per cent to ₹56,970 crore. Of this, 67.5 per cent (₹38,433 crore) was accounted for by the individual business and 32.5 per cent (₹18,537 crore) by the group business. Within Individual Business, share of Par products was 81.7 per cent (₹31,392 crore). Non Par APE grew over two-fold to ₹7,041 crore, comprising 18.3 per cent of individual business as against 8.9 per cent a year ago. Also read: Satin Creditcare raises ₹332 crore from Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank FMO LIC continued to lead in market share, in terms of first year premium Income, with a share of 58.9 per cent. The life insurer had a market share of 38.4 per cent in individual business and 72.3 per cent in the group business. LIC’s AUM increased 16.5 per cent to ₹51.2-lakh crore, and the solvency ratio improved to 1.98 from 1.87 at the end of FY23. The 13 th month persistency ratio, on premium basis, improved slightly to 77.7 per cent from 77.1 per cent but for the 61st month deteriorated to 60.9 per cent from 61.8 per cent. On the basis of number of policies, the 13 th month persistency improved to 67.0 per cent from 64.3 per cent whereas the 61 st month persistency fell to 48.6 per cent from 49.9 per cent. The share price of LIC gained 0.58 per cent to close at ₹1035.80 on the BSE. Comments",

        "content": "I spent £79 on drinks and hours standing in the Co-op Live arena waiting for Nicki Minaj...only for the gig to be cancelled Did YOU attend the concert? Email katherine.lawton@mailonline.co.uk By Katherine Lawton Published: 17:38, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A music lover spent £79 on drinks and hours standing in the Co-op Live arena waiting for Nicki Minaj only for the gig to be cancelled after the singer was arrested. The rapper, 41, was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday, just hours before she was supposed to be on stage at Manchester's Co-Op Live arena. She was held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport before continuing her tour in Birmingham on Sunday. Lottie Gibbons, a fan of the star, said the evening turned out to be 'shambolic' after she bought several rounds of drinks while waiting inside the arena, only to be told hours later that the show had been postponed. Her friends had flown from the Isle of Man and booked a two-night stay in Manchester's city centre, while Ms Gibbons made the journey from Liverpool to join them. The first warning sign appeared when Minaj tweeted a video showing her being detained at the airport following a luggage search. Did YOU attend the concert? Email katherine.lawton@mailonline.co.uk Lottie Gibbons (pictured) said the evening turned out to be 'shambolic' after she bought several rounds of drinks while waiting inside the arena, only to be told hours later that the Nicki Minaj concert was cancelled Nicki Minaj, 41, (pictured) was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday Fans leaving the Manchester Co-op Live venue after the Nicki Minaj show was postponed A text message alert informed fans that doors would open just 30 minutes later than scheduled, with Ms Gibbons and her friends heading over to the arena at around 7pm. 'This marked the beginning of a downward spiral, where the recently opened Co-op Live Arena, plagued by delays and teething problems, revealed its lack of experience,' she wrote for the Liverpool Echo . Once inside the arena, Ms Gibbons claimed her and her friends bought three rounds of drinks with 'wildly varying costs' - with two gin and tonics and one vodka and coke costing £38 - while the next round of two drinks costed £21. The fans then spent more than two hours looking at an empty stage without any updates from the arena, according to Ms Gibbons. 'Finally, at 9.35 pm, the first and only announcement over the tannoy confirmed the concert's postponement, prompting boos and a mass exodus of 20,000 disappointed fans,' she wrote. Minaj was held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport before continuing her tour in Birmingham on Sunday Ms Gibbons added: 'The whole night felt like a cash grab. While I understand the need to get people inside for safety reasons, it was clear from Nicki's arrest that the concert was unlikely to happen.' A statement from Co-op Live on Saturday said: 'Nicki Minaj's scheduled performance at Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday, May 25 has been postponed. Tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled performance which will be announced ASAP. 'Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible. We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused. More information will be available at your point of purchase.'

        "content": "German Ambassador to Nigeria, Annett Gunther, has claimed that renewable energy can create over 112 million jobs by 2030. She said this in Abuja at a reception organised by the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology for a German delegation on green hydrogen, recently. She highlighted that the sector had already generated employment opportunities for at least 390,000 individuals in Germany. Gunther declared, “The hydrogen industry is growing, stimulating economic growth and creating jobs in the process. “Hydrogen does not only seek to meet the climate change goals but also seeks to feed the population in this part of the world. “We are on the same page in this partnership on hydrogen and it will be in the interest of both countries.” The German Government was in partnership with Nigeria to combat climate change and related issues in the country, the German ambassador said. She added that the perennial floods in parts of Nigeria are a global challenge, aggravated by the climate change phenomenon. She noted that all hands must be on deck to tackle the root causes of climate issues, adding that decarbonisation and zero emissions would help to solve the problem not only in Nigeria but globally. The ambassador added that Nigeria had an ambitious goal in its energy transition plan, developed under the previous administration to ensure zero emissions until 2060, adding that, if properly implemented, it could be impactful. She revealed, “In our cooperation talks, we are interested in how to help Nigeria achieve that goal. “We, therefore, have opened a hydrogen diplomacy office called the German-Nigerian hydrogen diplomacy office where experts organise meetings, conferences, and discussions and bring together stakeholders in the area of renewable energies and particularly on hydrogen. “Even though gas is currently the primary source of energy and power, we have to chart the way forward. We need to have these discussions to reach our climate goals earlier or as soon as possible.”",

Returning to action after a frustrating injury spell, Nadal failed to come back with a bang and lost 3-6, 6-7, 3-6 to the German star. Two years after their epic unfinished match, Zverev hands Nadal his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland-Garros 🤯 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/OGsZ2RoQuc — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 See you soon 🧡 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/RtZ9gqj5kR — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 Nadal struggled early in the match, losing the first set 6-3 to Zverev. However, the second set saw the former World No. 1 showcase his resilience, pushing Zverev to the limit. Cameras captured Djokovic’s keen interest as he watched the thrilling encounter. Djokovic is watching too 👀 #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/vcJAaWQIf9 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 Rafael Nadal had a notable spectator during his first-round match at the French Open 2024, as World No. 1 and longtime rival Novak Djokovic watched from the stands. Joining Djokovic were Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, who also came to see Nadal in action against Alexander Zverev. This match marked Nadal’s return to Grand Slam tennis this year, as an injury had sidelined him from the Australian Open. Due to his low ranking, Nadal entered the tournament unseeded and faced a challenging draw. It will be interesting to see whether the Spaniard will play next year or will decide to put an end to an illustrious career of tennis.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

        "content": "The family of a \"loving\" 19-year-old who is reported to have taken his own life at a Welsh prison have slammed his \"appalling\" experience at the troubled jail. Michael \"Mikey\" Horton, from Newport, is one of nine inmates at Bridgend's HMP Parc to have died suddenly in the last three months. Mikey's family were among the dozens of people who protested outside Parc on Monday morning, calling for G4S — the private security giant that runs the prison — to be stripped of its £400million contract . Bereaved families led chants of \"G4S out\" and marched around the edge of the prison with placards bearing messages such as \"stop the drugs\" and \"HMP Corrupt to the Core\". It comes after WalesOnline revealed allegations from former staff members and prisoners of drug-dealing, violence, corruption, chronic understaffing and a lack of mental health support. G4S said the safety of staff and prisoners was their priority and that they \"have a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs\". They said all mental health support is based on an assessment and operates in the same way as it would in the community. READ NEXT: Baby mauled by pocket bully dog in 'tragic accident' READ NEXT: Kebab shop leaves 50 people ill and 11 in hospital with food poisoning Frances Jones, 60, described her nephew Mikey, who died on May 7, as \"a very loving boy\". She said: \"He was always in trouble but he was paying for his crime and doing his time. He deserved to walk out of here in November, not come out in a black bag. \"He had a very severe addiction on the outside world. We nearly lost Mikey around a year ago through boys who thought it rather funny to give Mikey these drugs and left him on a doorstep to die. We thought we had got through that. When someone goes to prison, you don't expect them to get the drugs in here. It is appalling.\" Although Mikey's family said G4S has told them the death was a suicide, they suspect drugs played a significant role in the lead-up. He had told them that the laundry where he had been working was a distribution point for drugs, the family said. Eventually the family say they started receiving calls from people asking for hundreds of pounds because Mikey \"had run up a drug debt\". They said he was subjected to controlling behaviour from dealers, who allegedly ordered him to throw boiling water on another prisoner. Frances said Mikey refused to do this, which they say led to him receiving threats and fearing for his own safety. Frances added that there were times when Mikey was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day. \"He was a very lonely boy,\" said Frances, who believes he should have received more mental health support. On the morning the family learned of his death, they allegedly found out more detail from WalesOnline's reporting than they had received from G4S. Frances claimed that it was only after fighting for answers from the G4S liaison officer that the family learned Mikey had been found hanged. They are awaiting toxicology results to find out if he had taken drugs before his death. “We are appalled at what he went through,” said Frances. “We want G4S out now, and we will do whatever we can to get them out.” Also protesting outside the prison were the family of Justin Lewis, a 29-year-old from Newport who reportedly took his own life on March 16. Justin's niece Shanna Hiscox, 20, described him as “charismatic and charming\" with an \"incredible\" talent for art, a love of magic tricks and \"a great sense of humour\". His sister Naomi Lewis, 31, said he was meant to be under monitoring every hour for potential self-harm, but alleged he was not checked for five hours before his death, which G4S has told the family was a suspected suicide. She believes staff should have safeguarded Justin better, given he had been admitted to hospital for serious self-harm just weeks before his death. Naomi said the family were left \"in disbelief and heartbroken\" by the news of Justin's death. Responding to prisons minister Edward Argar’s recent claim that Parc is \"safe\" and \"well-run\", Naomi claimed: “No, I disagree. You don't see [deaths] happening on this scale in other prisons. \"They are understaffed, there is no duty of care, they get all this money and they are not doing their jobs properly.\" And speaking about the reports of rife drug-dealing, she said: \"It's shocking. It's just so easily accessible... Families are losing their loved ones. We don’t want to see anyone else die.” Tanya Hardy travelled hundreds of miles to Parc from her home in Suffolk to raise awareness of the wider problems in the UK prison estate. She said her son Guy-Scott Pallemaerts, a 28-year-old father of two, died by suicide in the Mount prison in Hertfordshire last October after an alleged lack of mental health support. “Prisons should be about losing your liberty, not your life,” she said. You can see more of our coverage from the protest here . A G4S spokewoman said: “We extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who have died recently at Parc. As with all deaths in custody, these are being investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. The safety of staff and prisoners is our priority. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs and use a range of tactics to tackle the ingress of drugs and reduce demand. This includes robust security measures for staff, visitors and prisoners as well as substance misuse support to those in our care.\" She continued: \"The vast majority of our staff are hard working and honest. As with every other prison in the country, we work closely with the Police and the HMPPS counter-corruption team to crack down on the small number who may break the rules. All mental health support is based on an assessment and operates in the same way as it would in the community. In line with national policy, prisoners at risk of self harm or suicide are managed by a multi-disciplinary team and have a tailored support plan.” The spokeswoman added that Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board provides primary and secondary healthcare services at Parc. We have approached the health board for comment. Two of the nine recent deaths are thought to be from natural causes and at least four from drugs, according to the Ministry of Justice, which has issued an urgent notice on G4S to improve security at Parc. For mental health support, contact the Samaritans on 116 123, email them at jo@samaritans.org or visit samaritans.org to find your nearest branch.",

The former heavyweight champion, 57, became nauseous and dizzy, forcing flight staff to ask passengers if there was a doctor on board to provide assistance. Paramedics boarded the plane, which had already been delayed by two hours in Miami because of the heat, once it touched down in Los Angeles to give treatment. It comes just two months before the boxing legend is due to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Dallas. 'Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,' his representatives told The New York Post. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday Tyson's fellow passengers were asked if there was a doctor on board to give him assistance Read More Mike Tyson feels 's*** and sore' as he trains to fight Jake Paul at age 57 - as he opens up on the brutal toll camp is taking at New York press conference 'He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. 'He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.' Typical symptoms of an ulcer flare up include nausea and vomiting, bloating, belching and gas pain, as well as chest pain and fatigue. It comes after In Touch first revealed on Monday morning that Tyson 'had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded'. Sources claim the cabin crew 'issued an announcement asking for a doctor 30 minutes before landing and the message even came on everyone's screens.' 'He was in first class, but we were an exit row,' an eyewitness added. 'They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, \"He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.\" I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words \"Mike Tyson\" and she nodded her head yes.' Once the plane landed at LAX, there was another delay of around 25 minutes while the paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson, who has previously admitted he uses marijuana daily, has given the drug up while training to fight Paul because it is on the list of banned substances used by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. He also revealed he's given up sex temporarily as part of his training regime. Tyson admitted he uses marijuana daily but has given the drug up while training to fight Paul Fans have raved about Tyson's physique and punching power during recent training videos It comes just two months before the boxing legend is due to fight Jake Paul in Dallas 'He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,' his publicist Joann Mignano recently told USA TODAY Sports. 'But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his personal well-being and others like him.’' Read More REVEALED: VIP tickets for Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson to cost $2MILLION... here's what fans get in lucrative package Tyson will be 58 on July 20, when the fight against Paul is set for AT&T Stadium - the home of the Dallas Cowboys. The fight has been marred by criticism in recent weeks, particularly at the vast age gap between the two fighters. 'I don't see too many people critical about it. Look at this,' Tyson said at a press conference earlier this month.. When a reporter suggested there were critics, Tyson said, 'Who? Name me somebody. You? Who?' The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation is sanctioning the fight as a professional bout, but it will be eight two-minute rounds instead of 10 or 12 rounds lasting three minutes each. The gloves will be heavier (14 ounces instead of 10), which is supposed to reduce the power of punches. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition in November 2020 against Roy Jones in California, which wouldn't declare it a pro fight. Tyson was mostly annoyed by the scene and the questions, including when asked what it meant to have a chance to fill AT&T Stadium. 'I was doing this years ago, so this is nothing new to me,' said Tyson, who won 50 fights with 44 knockouts before retiring. 'This is new to this young boy over here.'

Dan Charlton was standing in his back garden in the early hours when he saw a green light and heard a 'whoosh' as the object plummeted to earth. The next day he discovered a small charred rock lying in a street close to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that he said was 'warm and smelt burnt'. Dan said: 'I went outside and looked up and saw this light and thought, \"Is that a firework?\" Dan Charlton was standing in his back garden in the early hours when he saw a green light and heard a 'whoosh' as the object plummeted to earth The next day, he discovered a small charred rock lying in a street close to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that was 'warm and smelt burnt' 'It was really close. It came down in a straight line and what was interesting was it had a green flame, like a hue, that burnt and then disappeared. 'You could hear it make a brief \"whoosh\" sound and then I was expecting a big bang but it was just silent. 'There was no one else around and I though, \"That's definitely a meteorite\". 'I was fascinated. If I had my camera I could've caught the last second - that would've been awesome.' He later showed a geologist a picture of the object, who told him it 'appears to be a meteorite' and said a simple test could prove it. He later took the rock to the University of Leeds where he met Professor Simon Kelley from the School of Earth and Environment Professor Kelley inspecting the object under a microscope to figure out what is was made of Dan explained: 'He said that it would have a light magnetic field so I got a magnetic and found that it worked.' He later took the rock he found on May 6 to the University of Leeds where he met Professor Simon Kelley from its School of Earth and Environment. Dan said: 'He looked at it a few times under the microscope. 'He wasn't 100 per cent convinced but he didn't really know what the rock was. He suggested it could be volcanic.' Professor Kelley said it was too early to tell the provenance of the rock but felt it was unusual and planned to carry out further testing. He said: 'When I looked at it with the microscope, there were clues that made me lean towards it being a terrestrial rock. Professor Kelley said it was too early to tell the provenance of the rock but felt it was unusual and planned to carry out further testing 'First of all, I could not see any evidence of a fusion crust. 'Meteorite falls normally have a thin coating of black melted rock which forms as a result of the friction of falling through the atmosphere. 'Also, I could see what appeared to be holes and medium-sized crystals. 'Most meteorites are extremely fine-grained and contain very characteristic circular structures called chrondrules. 'However, there are other types of meteorites, so we can't be certain about the rock's classification just yet.' Professor Kelley, whose areas of expertise include planetary science and geochronology, added: 'To be absolutely sure, we will investigate further. We will begin by cutting a slice of the rock. 'That slice will then be ground and polished so that it is so thin we can shine light through it and we will be able to identify the internal structures and minerals. 'That will take a couple of weeks to complete and we'll then get back in touch with Dan to share the details of what makes up the rock he found.'

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Women affairs minister Uju Ohanenye’s decision to file a suit that put paid to the impending mass marriage of 100 orphaned girls in Niger State is well-intentioned, but she might soon discover that she played God for nothing. While addressing a press conference, the minister pointed out that she stopped the ceremony so the ministry could find out if the girls to be married out were of the appropriate ages, determine the (self-)interests of the organisers/ sponsors, and crucially, if those women gave their consent. Now, the last point is where her good intentions might meet some blowback. Yes, it is good to inquire if those marriages are consensual. But what is consent and what does it mean to give it amidst the circumstances of choicelessness, social/religious pressures, manipulation, and fear of the uncertain (especially for poor rural women with limited education and marketable skills)? When women whose possibilities are narrowed by material poverty and limited upward mobility choose marriage as a face-saving option, a means to claim some social respectability, what does it mean to have made a “choice”? Sometimes, people consent to a legal contract like a marriage because they have no other choices. For all her good intentions, Ohanenye might soon find out that the road paved with the good intentions of gender empowerment might still lead to the Nigerian social and religious hell. Why? Given how much the controversy is wrapped in religious sentiment, it cannot be that hard for the girls’ family circles and the religious patriarchs in their community to “persuade” (read: coerce) the young women into giving “consent.” Merely for the audacity of a southern Christian woman to challenge what they would like us to believe is an expression of the Islamic North culture, “consent” can be extracted from the girls to vindicate the decision of their religious leaders who have socialised them into believing that marriage is their destiny. So, if those women insist to the minister’s emissaries that they gave their “consent” as legal adults, would that still justify the decision to mass marry them off? What would the minister then do if those women insist the marriage is their choice? That is why I think she needs to be careful about uncritically elevating “consent” into the main issue at stake here. Many a “consents” inked into legal documents were never truly consensual; they were merely inconvenient choices made within the constrictions of choicelessness. What I think needs to be severely discouraged is the culture of public officials using public funds to mass-marry people. Northern governors do it frequently, but it is a misuse of public resources. Other than a mad obsession with seeing women’s heads buried between the laps of domesticity, the men—and it’s always men!—have never advanced any logical reason for mass marriages and why the government should sponsor them. They say marriage is better than waywardness, but why are those the only options available to a woman? Being married goes beyond the wedding ceremony. Marriage is a serious business that should be reserved only for those who can afford it—physically, emotionally, socially, and quite crucially, financially. Those who do not have the money to stage a ceremony can do themselves the favour of getting married quietly in front of a judge, go home, and start building their lives. Nobody needs to get married on charity, period. Marriage is also a private business, and nothing—and I repeat, nothing—says having a grand wedding makes you more married than those who have the dignity to wed according to the limit of their means. The issue of using public funds for marriage is another reason I see those criticising the minister for her intervention as clowns. You cannot purport to get married with other people’s money and then turn around to tell them they have no business in your private (religious) affair. Speaker of Niger State House of Assembly, Abdulmalik Sarkindaji, the culprit who announced his plans to sponsor the ceremony as his “constituency project,” is also playing God by making the girls’ wedding his business. Yes, those girls lost their parents in banditry attacks in Mariga Local Government Area (which he represents), but why is it his business to pay the girls’ dowry? He is a lawmaker, and a public representative should not assume a paternalistic role in other people’s private lives. It would be a different argument if he were a private individual using his money to sponsor weddings. Rich and generous people sponsor weddings; it is their prerogative. Sarkindaji’s legislative overreach is the fallout of a political culture that hands lawmakers a huge sum of money to carry out something called “community projects,” initiatives well outside their responsibilities as lawmakers. For long, lawmakers have loosely defined what constitutes constituency projects, which is why people like Sarkindaji can stretch the meaning beyond tolerable elastic limits. The mass wedding event, which would have taken place tomorrow but is now suspended, was to be conducted alongside the flagging-off of a road network and—this is where it gets interesting— distribution of cars to the eight district heads and other critical stakeholders in the local government area. That the wedding of 100 couples is not even the main point of the event—just one item to check off the agenda—makes you wonder why the spectacle was necessary in the first place. That old men will be gifted cars while young women will get husbands illustrates how the skewed allocation of resources makes for poor productivity in this country. If Sarkindaji wants to be a proper sugar daddy, he should consider giving the car gifts to the women instead. Who knows, that initiative might be their chance at an independent life which, I can bet, Sarkindaji’s daughters enjoy. Though imperfect, Ohanenye’s challenging Sarkindaji is commendable. In fact, it is about time someone stood up to people who mass-marry poor women for dubious reasons and instructed them there is more to life than continuously satiating the region beneath your waistline. Mass marriage, as it takes place in northern Nigeria, is an agenda to keep poor people poor and perpetually beholden to predatory religious and political leaders. The problem of northern Nigeria has been a problem of the libido. To contain the libidinal urges, they stage mass (and early) marriages that produce mass children whose impoverished existence culminates in mass poverty, mass urchins that prowl the streets and eventually grow up into mass terrorists and mass bandits. If Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world today, most of it has to do with the North. They reproduce an ever-growing army of children merely born to give them political victories and decommissioned soon after every election. Nobody has plans for those children’s future. And for a long time, nobody could challenge them because of their propensity for violence. Their leaders’ inability to think of serious means of resolving their social issues outside of frequently tucking people inside marriage to reproduce has created a mass problem for Nigeria, one that will unfold for at least another 50 years. Finally, media reports stated that in response to the audacity of Ohanenye to file a suit against an impending mass marriage, the Muslim Lawyers Association declared that they had raised 32 lawyers—five of them Senior Advocates of Nigeria—to challenge her in court. As much as I doubt whether the minister is on firm legal ground on this issue, I think 32 supposedly trained professionals coming up to challenge her judgment is another pathetic example of the Nigerian tendency to overdo things. I would not worry about them too much though. If that many lawyers had to bunch themselves up like firewood just to pursue one case, they must be incompetent, ineffective, and frankly, unserious.",

The post JPMorgan Says BHP Plan Risks $4.3 Billion S. Africa Outflow appeared first on Daily Maverick.",
        "content": "Such an outflow, if a deal goes ahead, could weaken the rand, which has gained 4.4% against the dollar, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, over the last five weeks.The deal, proposed by BHP and rejected by Anglo, would involve Anglo distributing its holdings in its South African iron ore and platinum units to shareholders. That, according to JPMorgan’s South African mining analyst Catherine Cunningham, would lead to developed-market investor index funds selling the unbundled stocks, resulting in the outflow. While Anglo has spurned BHP’s $49 billion bid, it has agreed to talk to the company, which must now make a firm offer by May 29. A successful deal could also affect the share prices of the units, Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., Cunningham said. “There is now a materially higher probability that BHP will reach an agreed deal,”she wrote in the May 23 note to clients. “We see downside risk to the share prices of both Amplats and Kumba.” Cunningham didn’t assess the potential impact on the rand. Read More on The Takeover Battle: BlackRock Pressed Anglo to Extend Talks With BHP, FT Reports BHP Has a Week to Convince Anglo Its South African Plan Can Work Anglo Opens Talks With BHP After Rejecting $49 Billion Offer According to her analysis, developed-market funds would sell $9.4 billion in stock and $5.1 billion would be bought by emerging-market investors, resulting in the net outflow. JPMorgan estimated the index fund holdings in Anglo American based on publicly available data. “Locals will not sell anything, developed market index funds will sell every share they receive and DM active and others will sell 90% of what they receive,” Cunningham estimated. “EM active funds will buy 50% of what’s for sale.” Amplats, which has a market value of 192 billion rand ($10.5 billion), is nearly 80% owned by Anglo American. Kumba, which has a capitalization of 170 billion rand, is almost 70% held by Anglo American. Developed-market index funds would need to sell their shares as Johannesburg-listed stocks wouldn’t fit their investment mandate. Active investors are likely to want to limit their exposure to single-commodity and -country stocks. Kumba’s mines are all in South Africa while Anglo Platinum has one small operation in Zimbabwe, with the rest in South Africa. Spinning off the companies would also add $14.2 billion to the market capitalization of the MSCI South Africa index, or about 6%, Cunningham wrote. In response to BHP’s approach Anglo rushed out its own plan to streamline its business. That would include spinning off Anglo Platinum while retaining control of Kumba.",

        "content": "“Iron” Mike Tyson went a few rounds with an ulcer issue during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, but was able to answer the bell when the plane landed, according to his representatives. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” his publicist told the Daily News Monday. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” The former heavyweight champion “became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,” but has since bounced back, his representative said. Tyson’s team knocked down reports that the 57-year-old boxer’s medical setback caused disembarking delays Sunday and blamed an unrelated “air conditioning issue” for the inconvenience. Tyson is scheduled to in Texas on July 20. His handlers said the ‘s gastrointestinal issue will have no affect on that plan. Critics have expressed concern about the bout due to the 30-year age difference between the combatants. Boxing Insider Promotions promoter Larry Goldberg said in March there’s no way he could get the New York State Athletic Commission to allow a spectacle like that to take place in New York City. “The doctors would never sign off on it,” Goldberg said. “We couldn’t even suggest something like that here.” Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2005, but in 2020 for an exhibition with fellow former champion Roy Jones Jr., which ended in a draw. His professional career included 50 wins and six losses. The Brooklyn native won 44 matches by knockout.",

A Monte Carlo, nella zona al porto riservata alle barche di lusso, un motoscafo è improvvisamente piombato, senza controllo, su uno yacht fermo e un piccole gommone su cui, per fortuna, non c'era nessuno. Lo yacht, invece, era pieno di gente per un party, ma non ci sono stati feriti. Secondo alcune informazioni, lo yacht colpito sarebbe di proprietà della famiglia di Logan Sargeant, pilota Williams. L'incidente, infatti, è accaduto durante il Gran Premio di Formula 1. L’impatto è stato violento: i pezzi delle barche travolte sono schizzati in diverse direzioni, mentre il motoscafo è riuscito a restare fermo, incastrandosi fra le due imbarcazioni e mancando per un soffio due persone che stavano passeggiando sul molo.",

        "content": "EXCLUSIVE Melania Trump was missing from Donald's trial - here's what legal experts say it means for the ex-president Melania has not been among the family members to support Trump in court READ MORE: Would Trump get jail time if convicted in hush money case? By Sarah Ewall-wice, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In New York, Ny For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:51, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:50, 27 May 2024 e-mail 134 View comments As the trial of Donald Trump over hush money payments to a porn star heads into its final stage, Trump's wife Melania Trump has been noticeably absent from the courtroom. Over the course of five weeks, a series of Trump supporters including Republican lawmakers, former administration officials, vice presidential hopefuls and a few of his own kids have been in court. They've sat through hours of salacious testimony as the ex-president stands trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment for pornstar Stormy Daniels . Melania Trump, however, has remained far away from the New York criminal court room home in Florida . Melania Trump with former President Trump as they arrive at a GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, FL on April 6 just over a week before the hush money trial began in New York Read More Probation officers checking up on him, teaching school kids about crime and cleaning up graffiti: What Trump could face if he is convicted in New York and avoids jail Legal experts tell DailyMail.com that while it is often beneficial for a jury to see defendants with their spouse by their side in the courthouse, in this unique case it doesn't matter. 'Generally speaking, jurors pay attention to who is seated in the courtroom,' explained Anna Cominsky, Managing Attorney of New York Law School Legal Services. 'Defense attorneys usually like to have 'support' for their client evidenced by friends and family - it's something that humanizes the client. That said, this is a very different case. The jurors know that this is the former president.' Cominsky also pointed out that this particular courtroom is ' completely packed with people from both sides.' She said it makes it hard for the jury to distinguish who is there for whom. Ex-president Trump seated in the Manhattan criminal courtroom on May 21 as he stands trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records Berkeley Law professor John Yoo also said he did not think her absence matters much and may perhaps have a benefit to the defense. ' I could see how some jurors would ask where Melania Trump was. Perhaps her presence would show her support for Trump's story that his fling with Stormy never happened,' he added. 'But her presence would also buy into the prosecution's underhanded effort to make the trial about Stormy [Daniels], and not about whether any bookkeeping misdemeanors occurred and whether they concealed some greater crime.' Yoo argued Trump's defense team has done a good job of attacking the failure of the prosecution to prove its case on the law. He said they were smart to keep the focus on that and not alleged affairs. Cornell law professor Randy Zelin believes no one would care and 'it would look contrived anyway.' On Tuesday, both sides are set to give closing arguments before the case goes to jury for deliberations. While Melania has not traveled to New York to stand by her husband's side as he came face-to-face with Daniels or others testifying about the hush money payment , the former first lady has been spotted along side her embattled husband elsewhere. Earlier this month, the two sat side-by-side at their son Barron's high school graduation in Florida and the former first lady was seen smiling and clapping as Barron's name was called. Court in New York was recessed early for the week so the ex-president could attend. Former First Lady Melania and Trump were all smiles at the ceremony as their son Barron graduated from high school on May 17 Melania attended the Republican fundraiser hosted by billionaire John Paulson that raised more than $50 million as Trump runs for a second term in the White House The Trumps arriving to vote in Florida on March 19. When asked if she would be joining Trump on the campaign trail she responded 'stay tuned.' The former first lady has not attended any of Trump's 2024 rallies or primary election night celebrations to date Melania was also in attendance last month in a stunning purple jumpsuit for a campaign fundraiser hosted by John Paulson in Florida where the ex-president raised more than $50 million for his presidential bid. The former first lady jumped back into politics to speak at a fundraiser for the pro-conservative LGBT organization Log Cabin Republicans last month. But she has not hit the campaign trail for her husband as he holds rallies in battleground states across the country or celebrated his primary nights in early contest states. When asked if she would be joining him on the campaign trail in March while joining her husband to cast ballots in the Florida GOP primary, Melania responded 'stay tuned.' DailyMail.com has inquired with the Trump campaign about any future plans for Melania to hit the campaign trail. While Melania has not been spotted in court, both of Trump's older sons Don Jr. and Eric and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump have been in attendance for some of the many hours of testimony. His sons could be seen arriving and leaving the court with their father's large entourage and sitting a few rows behind him in the courtroom. His adult daughters Ivanka and Tiffany Trump's names have come up in the testimony during the hush money trial, but they have not appeared in the courtroom to support their dad. Both live in Florida. Trump's son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara Trump returning to the courtroom from a break in the hush money trial on May 14 Eric Trump has been a regular in the Manhattan criminal courtroom to support his father. Here he is returning to court behind the former president and lawyer Todd Blanche on May 6 Don Jr. looking on in the Manhattan criminal court as his father speaks before the media on May 21 Don Trump Jr. speaking in support of is father with other Trump supporters outside the Manhattan criminal court on May 21 Even without Melania's support in the courtroom, her name has surfaced across testimony from multiple witnesses. During her days of lurid testimony, Daniels recalled Trump telling her in 2006 before their alleged sexual encounter that Trump told her the couple slept in separate bedrooms . Michael Cohen claimed Trump was not worried about Melania leaving him over the Daniels affair story and even claimed the then presidential candidate said 'how long do you think I'll be on the market for?' But other witnesses painted a picture of a very different relationship between the former first couple during testimony.

Westerhout served as Trump's executive assistant while he was president A sketch of Westerhout breaking into tears on the stand as she testified about her regretful action that led to her exit from the Trump White House. She also testified about observing Trump and Melania's 'special' relationship up close Trump and Melania departing the White House to board Marine One a last time in January 2021 Trump's White House executive assistant said during her tearful testimony that Donald and Melania had a 'special' relationship. Madeleine Westerhout told the court she believed they had a relationship of mutual respect and Trump cared a lot about Melania's opinion. 'There was no one else who could put him in his place,' Westerhout testified. She also recalled Melania texting her asking when Trump would be coming up for dinner while they were in the White House and Trump calling Melania from the Oval Office while he was president to chat.

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday affirmed the victory of Governor Usman Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 11 November 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed it. The tribunal held that the petitioners – the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka – failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous decision, held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Kogi had on 11 November 2023 held its off-cycle election in which Mr Ododo of the APC emerged winner, beating his closest rival, Mr Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Mr Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Mr Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on 13 May when SDP, Mr Ajaka, APC, Mr Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgment in the petition.

Game 7, if necessary, will also be in Glens Falls on Wednesday. Adirondack looked lackluster, suffering back-to-back shutouts, in Games 3 and 4 in Florida last week, but rebounded to bring the series back home with a 4-2, Game 5 victory on Saturday. Ryan Smith scored what proved to be the game-winner at 5:19 of the third period from inside the right circle. The goal, his ninth of the playoffs, came off a well-placed pass from defenseman Darian Skeoch behind the right side of the net. Zach Walker also collected a helper on the play. Meanwhile, goaltender Jeremy Brodeur, making his first start of the series, stopped 35 shots to earn the win and keep Adirondack’s quest for a Kelly Cup championship alive. The Thunder jumped out to an early, 2-0, lead on first-period goals by Filip Engaras and Erik Middendorf. Engaras beat Everblades netminder Cam Johnson with a snapshot from the top of the left circle for a 1-0 advantage. Defenseman Will MacKinnon was credited with the lone assist on Engaras’s fifth goal of the playoffs. Middendorf made it 2-0 with 4:27 left in the first stanza on a wrister from the bottom of the right circle. Skating from behind the net to the bottom of the circle, he turned and fired a shot over Johnson’s left shoulder. Jackson van de Leest and Connor Blake were credited with assists. But the second period was all Florida’s as they outshot the Thunder, 19-6, and knotted the score at two goals apiece. Riese Zmolek beat Brodeur with a wrister from the hash marks at 16:31 of the frame and Cole Moberg scored on a power play with just 1:28 left in the period. Adirondack regained the lead on Smith’s goal, but the outcome was far from determined with almost 15 minutes left to play. With two minutes left on the clock, Thunder forward Ryan Wheeler went to the penalty box on a somewhat controversial call, for delay of game. The puck went above the glass but replays showed that a Florida player lifted Wheeler’s stick. Yet the call stood and the Everblades pulled Johnson in favor of an extra attacker, giving them a 6-on-4 power play. Tristan Ashbrook sealed the outcome by firing a shot into Florida’s empty net after winning a face-off at center ice. The goal was Ashbrook’s eighth of the postseason, shorthanded and unassisted. Ashbrook’s 15 points are the fifth-most among all ECHL playoff performers. Toledo’s Riley Sawchuk tops the leaderboard with 17.",

        "content": "The cost of living will remain the Government’s “focus” in this year’s Budget, Simon Harris has promised. Inflation shot up after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and averaged out at 8% in 2022. It began to slowly fall in 2023 and is forecast to drop further to 1.9% this year . Despite this, the Taoiseach said he is aware that “people are still hurting” and pledged to keep this in mind during budget negotiations. “Cost of living increases have left [people] feeling that their personal finances are somewhat insecure and, indeed, a real worry that they might not withstand any further shocks,” Mr Harris said. “Therefore, I believe that recognising the existence of cost of living pressures must once again be the focus as we plan for the next budget, building on previous measures over the last number of years.” Out on the streets of Dublin, a lot of people were keen to talk about how difficult it is to get by in the current economic climate. “Today I had to dip into my savings,” one woman in Dublin told Newstalk. “My savings actually consisted of €20, so now I’m down to my last €6 I would say and that was for lunch. “I would say we’re very much still in a cost of living crisis . “A lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck, rent is getting higher, everything is increasing and even though the minimum wage has gone up, you’re just on par with what it was before. “So, I don’t really think I’ve seen any improvement.” One man said he felt the cost of living crisis was far from over. “Being a student, it’s well documented how we get affected by this kind of thing,” he said. “I’m on placement in Dublin at the moment and I’m living with my uncle and I went through three years of college living with my Grandad. “If I didn’t have that availability there, I don’t know if I’d be able to see out the three and a bit years of college.” Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , DCU Economics Professor Edgar Morgenroth said wages have yet to catch up with the galloping inflation of the past two years and so so “on average people are worse off”. “There are some sectors, some groups in the economy that seem to have higher wage increases but most definitely down relative to inflation,” he said. “So, yes people are in real terms worse off than they were.” Professor Morgenroth said the poorest in society always suffer “much much more” when inflation is high and urged the Government to consider this when drawing up budget measures. “If we are going to support people, I would argue that we should support those that are actually most affected and that would be those on lower incomes,” he said.

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline German tennis star Alexander Zverev defeated Spanish legend Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open on Monday, moving on to the second round at Rolland Garros, though in just days, the German star’s appeal of assault allegations will head to trial. Alexander Zverev defeated all-time great Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open. Key Facts The six-foot-six Zverev, 27, is the fourth-ranked men’s singles tennis player and considered one of the favorites in the tournament. Zverev defeated 37-year-old Nadal in a highly anticipated first-round match Monday morning, taking the match in three sets over 14-time French Open champion Nadal, who has struggled to return from injuries and ranked only No. 276. Off the court, the 27-year-old’s career has become marked by scandal: Zverev was accused in an October 2023 lawsuit of “physically abusing and damaging the health” of a woman during a May 2020 argument in Berlin, according to the suit filed in Germany. That woman was later identified as his former girlfriend Brenda Patea, a model and the mother of Zverev’s daughter, and Zverev has denied the allegations. Later in October, a German criminal court fined Zverev $488,000 (450,000 Euro) over the charges (public prosecutors in German courts can seek penalty orders when there is compelling evidence that does not necessitate a trial, The Athletic and The Guardian reported). Zverev appealed the order, bringing the challenge to trial in Berlin court, calling it “completely bulls**t” with his lawyers slamming it as “scandalous.” Patea has since gone public about the allegations, telling German magazine Suddeutsche Zeitung in November that Zverev pushed her against a wall and proceeded to choke her. Zverev’s trial in Berlin is slated to start on May 31, putting it in the middle of the French Open, though he will not be required to appear in person at court, at least at first, the BBC reported, though he could still “theoretically” be asked to attend later in the trial, a court spokesperson said. The trial is expected to last eight non-consecutive days that could take proceedings into mid-July, ESPN reported.

Tangent This assault case follows previous abuse allegations against Zverev from his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova, who accused the German star of punching her in the face and covering her face with a pillow, leaving her “scared for [her] Chief Critics In the wake of the allegations, Zverev faced public criticism after he was elected to an ATP advisory council in January. U.S. tennis star Sloane Stephens told reporters at the time a women’s star facing similar charges would not have been elected to the WTA player council, while Iga Swiatek, the No. 1 women’s player, told reporters “it’s not good when a player who’s facing charges like that is kind of being promoted.” Surprising Fact Zverev starred in an episode of Netflix’ since-canceled docuseries “ Break Point ” last year dedicated to his recovery from an ankle ligament tear and a surgery that sidelined the German star for months. Controversially, the episode never mentioned the allegations against Zverev. The show was canceled in March. Contra Nadal, regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time, has 92 singles titles to his name and holds the record as the winningest player in men’s singles competition at the French Open, though this year he entered the tournament unseeded following a string of injuries that kept him sidelined for months. He last won the French Open in 2022, defeating Zverev in the semifinals, when Zverev stumbled and injured his ankle so badly he left the court in a wheelchair and was sidelined from the sport for months. What To Watch For Zverev’s next match is scheduled for Wednesday against the winner of the first-round match between Germany’s David Goffin and France’s Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Big Number Over $2.6 million. That’s how much the winner of the men’s singles competition at the French Open will take home as a grand prize (roughly 2.4 million Euros). Key Background Zverev broke onto the international tennis scene as a 20-year-old in 2017, defeating three-time French Open winner Novak Djokovic at the 2017 Italian Open and Swiss star Roger Federer at the Rogers Cup that same year. In 2018, he was named on Forbes Europe’s 30 Under 30 in Entertainment, along with artist Dua Lipa, actress Millie Bobby Brown and actor Daniel Kaluuya. Zverev has since won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but has not yet won a grand slam singles title. Further Reading Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Archaeologists make gruesome new discovery about first English settlers in North America READ MORE: Jamestown's original four colonial leaders discovered By Nikki Main Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 15:55, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:35, 27 May 2024 e-mail 11 shares 213 View comments The first English settlers to arrive in North America ate dogs to survive an extreme period of starvation, according to a gruesome new study. Researchers at the University of Iowa discovered the remains of 16 indigenous dogs at an archaeological site in Jamestown , Virginia , that strongly suggest the 17th Century settlers ate at least six canines. Their remains showed hallmark signs that the colonists had skinned the animals, dismembered their limbs and removed the flesh from their bones between 1609 and 1617 AD, the team said. The events occurred during the 'Starving Time', when food shortages, fractured leadership, disease and violence with the Indigenous tribes wiped out the Jamestown community. Archaeologists found the remains of 16 Indigenous dogs and confirmed that English settlers killed them for food in the early 17th Century. The canines were found in the Jamestown, Virginia settlement Archaeologists excavated roughly an acre of land within the boundaries of the James Fort. They recovered 181 canine bones from trash deposits in a former workshop, two wells and within a construction trench for the fort's defense walls. The 'butchered dog remains... unquestionably date to Jamestown's Starving Time during the winter of 1609–1610, indicating that Indigenous dogs were eaten during this period of severe famine,' the study said. Archaeologists said the practice was not uncommon at the time. 'Although the consumption of dog flesh in modern Western societies is considered taboo, there is a long history of eating dogs during periods of stress in England and other parts of Europe ,' they wrote. The Starvation Period killed 80 to 90 percent of the English colonists because of food shortages, contaminated water supply and a harsh winter. Archaeologists found 181 canine bones belonging to 16 dogs, and said that at least six had been eaten by English settlers between 1609 and 1617 Jamestown's checkered past Church burnings, cannibalism and slavery By the spring of 1610, only about 60 of the original colonists were still alive and George Percy - one of the original settlers - authored an account of what occurred in the wake of the starvation period. 'Now all of us at James Town, beginning to feel that sharp prick of hunger which no man truly describe but he which has tasted the bitterness thereof. '... Then having fed upon horses and other beasts as long as they lasted, we were glad to make shift with vermin as dogs, cats, rats, and mice,' Percy wrote in excerpts of his account called 'Starving Time,' archived by the National Humanities Center . He added that the settlers turned to cannibalism as a means to survive and dug up 'dead corpses out of graves and to eat them, and some have licked up the blood which has fallen from their weak fellows.' The archaeologists reported that the dogs' DNA was of Native American ancestry, sharing similarities with the Hopewellian, Mississippi and Late Woodland period dogs from eastern North America. This signified the social issues that arose between the colonizers and Indigenous communities, according to the study. It 'suggest(s) complex forces at play before, during, and after the Starving Time that influenced the presence of these dogs in the fort and led the residents of Jamestown to consume dogs with Indigenous ancestry,' the study said.

The lake and parks were supposed to open from 3pm on Monday. All the clubs at Rabindra sarobar have also been instructed by KMDA to keep shut till 12 noon on Tuesday and rowing activity in the lake will be allowed only after the authorities conduct an inspection. \"Rowing activity in Rabindra sarobar will commence only after a joint inspection by KMDA and police,\" said an official. The decision to further keep the lakes and parks closed till Tuesday night was taken after KMDA officials went to inspect the condition of Rabindra sarobar on Monday afternoon. \"At least eight to nine full grown trees fell and branches of many trees continued to fall in many places inside the lake premises. We would try to replant the trees as much as possible depending on whether the trees are retrievable or not,\" said a KMDA official. The authorities cleared the trees on Monday and kept aside for replantation if found to be suitable. \"We are receiving many requests from NGOs for replantation of the trees. We are allowing them to replant the trees by themselves if they want to after the weather condition improves,\" an official said.",

        "content": "Days after skirmishing with Destiny’s Child alum Kelly Rowland on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival , a security officer was scorned by the internet for her treatment of a K-pop star—marking her third uncomfortable run-in with a celebrity so far. Rowland went viral for pointing her finger at the guard during their encounter last week. She later explained that she felt she had been mistreated and shooed off the red carpet because of her race. “The woman knows what happened. I know what happened,” Rowland said. “I have a boundary, and I stand by those boundaries. And that is it.” “There were other women that attended the carpet who did not quite look like me, and they didn’t get scolded or pushed off or told to get off,” she added. “And I stood my ground, and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground, and that was it.” Soon after, the same security guard, who has not been identified by name, visibly irritated Dominican actress Massiel Taveras, seemingly by trying to move her forward along the carpet. Taveras reacted by pushing the guard away. Then, over the weekend, the guard put up an arm and blocked K-pop star turned actress Yoona, who had turned to greet her fans. The incident was somewhat less dramatic, as Yoona did not react visibly, but still attracted negative attention for the guard’s rough tactics, and because all three celebrities she tussled with are women of color.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria ASUU kicks against student education loan, calls for intervention in tertiary institutions Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News ASUU kicks against student education loan, calls for intervention in tertiary institutions Published on May 27, 2024 By Lovina Anthony The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Calabar Zone, has vehemently opposed the proposed Student Education Loan of the Federal Government. It described the loan as not only “strangulating” but has the capacity of subjecting the benefiting students to slavery, perpetual debt, depression and eventual suicide. Addressing a press conference in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital on Monday, the Zonal Cordinator of ASUU, Happiness Uduk flanked by all the Chapter Chairmen of the zone said it was disheartening that the people who attended schools on scholarship, enjoyed meal subsidies, bursary awards among others were the ones making some of these obnoxious policies saying that the union would not relent in opposing such policies. Uduk in a statement jointly signed by the eight union Chairpersons reasoned that instead of giving loans for students education; FG could use the money for interventions in higher institutions saying that such would bring about positive turnaround of events that would make the institutions self reliant with highly subsidized tertiary education in the country. According to her, “It is disheartening that people who attended schools on scholarship, enjoyed meal subsidies, free laundry services and bursary awards are the same running our economy today. Their Children are on scholarship in the best foreign universities in the world but after siphoning our economy, they turn around to impose a strangulating Education Loan in tax payers’ children so that they will be enslaved and remain indebted to the country forever. They do not mind the devastating effect of this scheme on the country, such as depression, suicide, and collosal loss of intellectuals. “To this end, we vehemently condemn the idea of Education Loan and state clearly that using the money for intervention in higher Institutions will be about a positive turn-around of events that will make our institutions self reliant on highly subsidized tertiary education in Nigeria.” The union also called on the federal government to come to a renegotiation table and reconvene a committee to review the agreement reached by ASUU leadership and Prof. Nimi Brigs-led Government committee with the view of adjusting the document according to the current economic realities so as to have acceptable salary structure for university lecturers. The union also condemned the indiscriminate proliferations of universities in Nigeria without adequate funding by both the Federal and state governments, noting that 2020 ASUU-FGN Memorandum of Action (MoA), which stressed the need to review the NUC Act to make it more potent in arresting the reckless and excessive establishment of universities, should be fully implemented. “We urge the President Tinubu-led administration to refrain from further proliferation of universities and rather consolidate on the already existing ones. What we need are universities that are adequately equipped and empowered to address the challenges confronting Nigeria, not glorified schools,” the statement added. On the ongoing minimum wage negotiation, the ASUU Calabar Zone urged FG to immediately deploy the instrumentality of collective bargaining to conclude the social dialogue, saying that such would lessen the invasive decline in the socio-economic lives of Nigerians. It further urged federal, state and local governments to take a critical look at all unworkable policies and programmes sponsored by international money lenders such as the World Bank and IMF with a view to reclaiming the country’s sovereignty and restoring the confidence of Nigerians. The union, however, advised governments and her agencies to read the Act establishing universities and stop interfering and threatening the autonomy of the universities, especially in terms of policy, academic planning and administration, even as it advised that suspended members in Ebonyi State University be recalled in obedience to the declarations and orders of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria. It added that outstanding salaries of academics in all institutions should be paid without further delay, noting that failure to accede to their demands would make them embark on industrial action, even as it regretted that it resorted to strike to press home its demands as that was the only language the government understood.

        "content": "Glamorous doctor 'faked cancer diagnosis to scam friend out of $160,000' Monica Kehar allegedly defrauded her medical colleague out of thousands She claimed she had cancer and needed money to foot her housing bills READ MORE: 'Fake' California doctor treated thousands of patients By Mackenzie Tatananni For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:37, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:23, 27 May 2024 e-mail 5 View comments A glamorous Canadian doctor has been banned from practicing medicine and shamed by friends who say she scammed them out of $160,000 with a fake cancer diagnosis. Monica Kehar is accused of fabricating the illness to bilk friend Dr. Meaghan Labine out of the money before vanishing. The pair met in 2018 when both were chosen to sit on the national body representing the College of Family Physicians of Canada . Labine says Kehar preyed on her conscience, asking her for the money after lying about a breast cancer diagnosis and claiming she was struggling to afford housing for a residency program in Calgary. 'It just seemed like no matter how much I lent, it was never enough,' Labine told CBC News . Monica Kehar is accused of scamming a fellow doctor out over $160,000 CAD after faking a cancer diagnosis and asking for money Labine plied Kehar with contracts that she signed, promising to repay her, but the requests didn't stop. 'I felt absolutely humiliated,' Labine told the publication. 'How could I be so stupid as to be led on like this?' She would later learn that Kehar had not only lied about the illness, but had not been accepted into a residency program in Calgary, either. In fact, Kehar was expelled from her medical program following a series of infractions that culminated with the fabrication of a medical condition. On November 13, 2020, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba Investigation Committee censured Kehar 'as a record of its disapproval of her conduct.' According to documents reviewed by DailyMail.com, Kehar registered with the College and enrolled as a first-year family medicine resident at the University of Manitoba in February 2019. Kehar was expelled from a program in Manitoba following a series of infractions that culminated with the alteration of documents and the fabrication of a serious medical condition The College later learned that Kehar defrauded 'substantial sums of money' from two medical colleagues after lying about the state of her health 'to garner sympathy and support.' However, she began participating in an elective in Saskatchewan without the proper license. Kehar would later claim that this slip-up was 'inadvertent.' After she was alerted to the problem, Kehar immediately stopped practicing and altered an email she had received from the College before forwarding it to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. 'This was an apparent attempt by Ms Kehar to remedy the situation and to deflect responsibility for this error from herself onto the College,' the document reads. The College discovered the alteration on February 14, 2019 and reported to the University of Manitoba the same day. The finding prompted both the College and University to conduct months-long investigations into Kehar’s behavior. She denied altering the email, but was placed on paid leave of absence pending further review. Meaghan Labine says she has yet to be paid back despite winning a default judgement against Kehar in 2022. Kehar has a lengthy history of lying, as evidenced by documents from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba Investigation Committee Kehar later contacted administrators, claiming 'she had received an email from another person who confessed to hacking her account and altering the February 13, 2019 email.' Around March 13, Kehar was allowed to return to her resident duties, and around two days later, the University provided her with a report showing there was no evidence to support the hacking claims. Kehar ultimately took responsibility for altering the document, blaming 'a brief episode of mental exhaustion.' She claimed the decision had arisen from 'fear, stress, exhaustion and nervousness.' Also in 2019, Kehar had her French bulldog, Django, registered as an 'emotional support dog' for 'stress related' reasons in Alberta, documents reviewed by DailyMail.com show. She later admitted that she had altered the offending email, and was expelled from the University of Manitoba's Family Medicine Program on May 7. 'Her expulsion was based on her admission to having altered the e-mail in question, and the Faculty's finding that Ms Kehar had been dishonest in relation to certain other academic events, which she denied,' the document states. Just weeks later, Kehar appealed her expulsion to the University's Local Discipline Committee. In the appeal, she 'described a concern that she might have had a serious health condition... and that she underwent a surgical procedure to address the concern in January of 2019.' The document quotes her as saying, 'Though I am not comfortable discussing this issue, I now understand that it is relevant to this matter and had an impact on me and my actions during this time.' On May 28, seven days after filing the appeal, Kehar was interviewed by the College Investigator. She described 'going through a very difficult time' beginning at the end of 2018 and 'feeling extremely stressed at the time.' Following her expulsion from a residency program at the University of Manitoba, Kehar opened up an electrical muscle stimulation clinic in Surrey, British Columbia Kehar also insisted that she had undergone surgery on January 8, but failed to provide documentation. The appeal of Kehar’s expulsion was heard and dismissed that June - but she filed again in July. In August, Kehar provided the College with a letter purportedly written by the office manager of her surgeon's clinic as proof of the aforementioned surgical procedure. Her lawyers claimed that there was no documentation from the hospital because Kehar 'did not stay overnight.' Subsequent investigations by the College found no evidence to support Kehar's assertion of a diagnosis, nor her claim of having undergone surgery at the hospital she named. Moreover, an investigation found that the letter she provided had been written much earlier and about a different matter, but Kehar altered it. The surgeon she identified confirmed that the only procedures he had ever performed on Kehar were in October 2017 and February 2018, and neither were related to the supposed 'serious medical condition.' The second appeal of her expulsion was heard on January 24, 2020, and dismissed five days later. The College later learned that Kehar had lied to two colleagues about her personal circumstances, including the state of her health, 'to garner sympathy and support.' Those colleagues loaned Kehar 'substantial sums of money in response to requests from her for assistance on multiple occasions,' according to the document. Kehar 'acknowledged that her conduct was a serious mistake and expressed remorse over her actions in retrospect,' and 'acknowledged that she has demonstrated an unfitness to practice.' Despite being barred from practicing medicine, former clients insist Kehar advertised 'M.D. provided services' and presented herself as a licensed medical practitioner Her expulsion was upheld, meaning she was barred from practicing medicine in the country. Despite this, Kehar moved to British Columbia and founded Prestige Body Lab, an electrical muscle stimulation clinic, billing herself as a doctor all the while. Business cards viewed by DailyMail.com promise 'M.D. provided services' at the clinic in Surrey, which has since shuttered. Per Canadian regulations, Kehar is still allowed to refer to herself as a doctor or MD, but cannot mislead the public into believing she is licensed to practice medicine. And some former clients insist this is just what she did. Read More My friend Belle Gibson faked cancer, met real patients and mimicked their symptoms... I suspected she was lying after seeing her excessive drinking and tanning habits On the clinic's Instagram page, which has since been taken down, Kehar offered 'free MD consultations' and services in exchange for honest reviews. One comment beneath a testimonial from May 2023 asserts that Kehar 'lied to thousands of women by presenting as an active doctor.' 'Just giving you a friendly heads up as many influencers have had to put out public, apologies to the women in the greater Vancouver area as they were being held responsible for promoting this particular businesswoman in return for free sessions or discounted sessions,' the commenter wrote. Another user claimed they were 'one of her victims' and thanked the original commenter for 'saving lots of people from her.' Despite winning a default judgement against Kehar in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2022, Labine has yet to be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars she lost. She recently filed a lawsuit in British Columbia in an attempt to get her hands on the money. While Kehar has promised to pay her back, Labine has her doubts. 'When pressed for specifics or meeting with my lawyer, she provides nothing,' she told CBC News.

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Tourism in Japan has witnessed an unprecedented surge, with the country’s rich heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences attracting visitors from across the globe. However, this influx of travellers has brought about unforeseen challenges, as Japan grapples with the delicate task of preserving its cherished cultural traditions while accommodating the growing tourism demand. As iconic destinations bear the brunt of overcrowding and disrespectful behaviour, the nation finds itself at a crossroads, seeking to strike a balance between welcoming guests and safeguarding its way of life. As per a news channel, recently, tourists have been banned from certain private streets in Kyoto’s famous historic Gion district, traditionally home to the teahouses where geisha (geiko) and maiko (apprentice geiko) performers work, largely due to antisocial behaviour. A video titled “Don’t do this in Kyoto” shows a tourist intruding on a geisha’s privacy by filming her persistently.",

        "content": "piranka Dear readers/followers You may recall that a number of months ago, back in March, I started covering a UK-based REIT called Big Yellow ( OTCPK:BYLOF ). I considered the company a \"BUY\" at the time, and now I'm updating given a double-digit outperformance to market. I'm downgrading the company at this time for reasons related to company valuation - in layman's terms, it's become too expensive at this particular time. The Big Yellow Group is the largest self-storage business in the UK. I've recently covered other UK REITs as well that you'll see articles on here on Seeking Alpha, and I believe the UK market offers a very compelling, low-valuation entry into what is without a doubt - to my mind - qualitative real estate plays. And this company, dear readers, is most definitely one of those plays. I invest quite a bit in European REITs like Gecina and Icade, as well as now in the Supermarket Income REIT ( OTCPK:SUPIF ), which is one of those plays you will get to read about. But the point here is Big Yellow. Since my last article, we can see the following outperformance for the company here. Seeking Alpha Big Yellow Article TSR (Seeking Alpha Big Yellow Article TSR) As you can see, the outperformance is material, indicating if nothing else that the short-term valuation at the time of my last article was wrong. There's no doubt to me that European REITs are more volatile than their American counterparts. However, I really believe that this has to do with them being misunderstood in terms of risk/reward, such as aforementioned Icade and Gecina. While the European real estate segment is currently in a downturn, this creates what I believe to be excellent investment opportunities for the next 5-15 years. And above all, I look to the long term. Aside from that, England or Great Britain is a great market for me. There is no dividend withholding tax , which makes any investment there even more hassle-free than most of the other European markets I invest in, even with my current circumstances of getting 99.8% of all withholding back within 12 months (specific DTS circumstances in Sweden relatively unique to our tax domicile). So I have a stated target of finding attractive UK-based plays/LSE-based tickers. Let's see, therefore, what we have here. Updating on Big Yellow - a lot to like even now. So, a quick rundown of the company again, self-storage player, the biggest in the UK, has never missed a 5-year estimate negatively, and one of the trickiest markets not only in the UK but in Self-storage. It's already part of the FTSE250, and According to surveys done by the Self-Storage Association in the UK, Big Yellow has the largest brand awareness in the UK self-storage sector. It's comparable, as I see it, to something like Public Storage ( PSA ) here. The company is 26 years old, and exists in the following geography, with an apparent focus, as you can see, on the larger London area. Big Yellow IR (Big Yellow IR) As I said in my initial piece, the company is in a very underpenetrated and fragmented market, offering both growth and consolidation potential. This is unlike the US, which I would characterize as a mostly mature market, especially on the coasts and in urban areas. With customer satisfaction and other quality indicators and the company already mostly digitized, Big Yellow already operates what in the USA would be considered a qualitative operation with scale and very good synergies. The company's assets are primarily freehold RE, with a concentration in large population areas like London and the Southeast. The company's metrics continue to show growth over time, and we're not just talking about any growth, but double-digit growth in profit and revenues. Big Yellow IR (Big Yellow IR) The big news is that we have end-year results reported as of May 20th. But first, I want to show you Big yellows overall returns over time, if you had invested in the company. We're talking quadruple digits 20-year returns, and significant overall market outperformance. Big Yellow TSR (Big Yellow TSR ) Key KPIs for the full fiscal of 2024 include significant revenue growth, a 7% growth in store EBITDA, a 1% growth in profit before tax adjusted, and a flat dividend that nonetheless keeps BYG's payout and yield at a competitive level in the broader perspective, though not necessarily \"great\" as such. BYG currently has a market cap close to £2.5B, which once again makes it a relatively small player. But I want to be perfectly clear that this company does not miss estimates. Despite the lack of a credit rating, the sheer forecast accuracy and earnings and dividend safety could arguably raise it to the safety level of something like a larger, US-based storage REIT. BYG Forecast Accuracy F.A.S.T Graphs (BYG Forecast Accuracy F.A.S.T Graphs) The company has the core focus of driving shareholder value through a combination of new prospects, customer satisfaction, revenue driving. BYG IR (BYG IR) Operating numbers for the year and overall demand indicators are very solid. The total number of move-ins is up 1% for the year. The company characterized this as \"muted conditions\", which mirrors what we're seeing across the pond in the US. Companies are seeing the effects of higher inflation and higher cost awareness. Current occupancy in the established BYG units/stores is at around 84-85%, which is slightly down from last year, with a total occupancy across the entire group nonetheless above 80%. This is slightly below some US averages. I would characterize the reason for this not as a requirement of growing the company portfolio, but rather a current general muted trend, that's likely to reverse over time as inflation and other indicators do so. BYG IR (BYG IR) The full-year results, while muted, provide a good basis for further growth and profit for Big Yellow. The market dynamics, as I see them, are intact. The UK self-storage market remains underpenetrated, especially in urban areas, where concentration remains low. Even at an average 80% occupancy, the company can drive profit with such numbers. Self-storage is also far more a part of the current societal ecosystem than it was only 20 years ago, and the company, like its US counterparts here, has shown resilience and excellent performance during the pandemic. Out of other self-storage players, BYG is by far the largest in the UK, with 90% of inquiries now online-based, and the company's stores are usually located on arterial or main roads, with extensive frontage and high overall visibility. Continued innovation and investment CapEx means the company's technology and solutions are up to par here, and the company's customer satisfaction scores are, as mentioned, one of the highest out there. Fundamentally speaking, despite the lack of a credit rating, nothing is really in a worrying state here. BYG has less than 15% long-term debt to capital, making it one of the most conservatively leveraged players in the entire industry. Let's look at the updated valuation. Valuation for Big Yellow - no longer as appealing So, unfortunately, we no longer have an appealing valuation for entry with Big Yellow. That has nothing to do with company fundamentals, but instead everything to do with pricing for the share. It's a bit sad that I \"have to\" change my rating only 2–3 months, but that's what I do when new facts present themselves - I change my thesis. The new fact here is that we have BYG trading at a P/AFFO of something like 20x, which is not only on par with but above companies like Public Storage (PSA), a similar REIT where I own a significant portfolio stake. PSA, as a comparison, trades at around 18x, but with a yield of 4.41%, far above that of BYG at 3.6%, and also comes with very compelling accuracy ratings. That would mean that currently, between these two, PSA is by far the more preferred \"BUY\" as I see it, and is also reflected in the fact that I recently added to PSA - but did not add to BYG. BYG instead offers us the following upside at a P/AFFO of 20x. Big Yellow Upside F.A.S.T graphs (Big Yellow Upside F.A.S.T graphs) And despite the company's fundamentals, I remind you that I in fact, in my last article, put my PT on BYG at a level of £11/share. I also mentioned that it becomes more interesting as it drops below the 18x level, which it hasn't. It has instead approached 21x. Therefore, my stance change to \"HOLD\" is entirely logical and in line with my overall expectation of a PT of £11/share, and where I put my attractive target ranges. Other analysts are fairly clear on where they consider this company to be interesting. Big Yellow is currently followed by 15 analysts, 7 of which give the company a positive \"BUY\" or \"outperform\" rating. This comes with a low PT of around £9 to a high PT of about £14.3. The average lies at £12.1, which at a price target as it currently is does not really give us any sort of upside. We're also no longer buying BYG at a discount to EPRA NAV. We're, in fact, paying a non-trivial premium to the company's EPRA NAV of just above £11/share. (Source: Author calculations, Big Yellow Group IR) For that reason, I no longer believe this company to be a worthy investment for any value-oriented investor's portfolio, and would consider it a \"HOLD\" with the following updated thesis for May of 2024. Thesis Big Yellow Group is Great Britain's largest self-storage REIT and one that I view as still in its basic growing stages. This company has what I view as a bright future and good prospects to grow even further both inorganically and organically as its services expand to other UK cities and geographies. I also want to point to the company's fundamentals, which are actually very solid. The company may lack a formal credit rating, but it nonetheless offers safety to a degree that I consider to be good enough for investing. It's diversified enough that the company isn't likely to see a sudden downturn from any one market, with perhaps the exception of London, which I consider unlikely. However, as of the most recent update, we do have the company rising too far based on my share price target - and I am not changing my share price target here. I consider Big Yellow Group to be a \"HOLD\" with a PT of £11/share and a P/FFO target of around 18-20x P/FFO at most, and becoming less interesting as it rises above 20x. Remember, I'm all about : 1. Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight, and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. 2. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1. 3. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation, but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows. 4. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1. Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized). This company is overall qualitative. This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run. This company pays a well-covered dividend. This company is currently cheap. This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion. For that reason, the company doesn't fulfill my valuation-related criteria, and now represents a \"HOLD\" here.

        "description": "Another surprise could be awaiting with AMD Ryzen 9000 in the form of new X870 AM5 boards by Sayan Sen Image via AMDIt looks like AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors, powered by Zen 5 architecture, will be full of quite a few surprises. The biggest one of them is the apparent lack of support the chips have for Windows 10 according to a supposed Lenovo manager. The Ryzen 9000 naming itself is a bit surprising considering the 8000 series desktop CPU nomenclature is now held solely by the G-series APUs only with much of it going to mobile SKUs. That's not all though as AMD is seemingly looking to rename Strix Point APUs from 8050 series to \"Ryzen AI HX\" potentially looking to capitalize on the AI hype and buzz surrounding almost everything nowadays. If you recall, AMD made a big deal about its Ryzen 8000G APUs as they had the \"world's first NPU in desktop processors.\" The third surprise is allegedly heading our way at Computex 2024 as AMD will be unveiling new 800 series chipset boards that will socket the Ryzen 9000 series processors. The rumour has surfaced from Chinese news outlet Benchlife which has in the past provided credible leaks and it claims it has to do with matching with Intel's chipset naming. In a news article surrounding a newly released Gigabyte B650E motherboard, the site has added that 800 series board for upcoming 9000 series CPUs \"has been confirmed\". It writes (Google-translated to English): GIGABYTE is clearly ready for AMD's next generation Ryzen processors. Obviously, we can expect various motherboard manufacturers to display AMD and Intel 800 series chip motherboards at Computex 2024; it has been confirmed that the chips used with AMD Ryzen 9000 will be called the 800 series, the same as Intel. If this turns out to be true, it will mean AMD is going to skip a digit for the first time in its chipset naming. The company started the AM5 (LGA1718) socket with its 600 series boards and it had stuck with this naming since 300-series back when AM4 was launched alongside Zen 1. Speaking of the 300-series, it is believed AMD started with that number as it wanted to one-up Intel since at that time, Team Blue had 200 series chipsets. So, the rumour certainly seems plausible. One thing that is not surprising about this news is the timing as we have already had evidence about upcoming AMD boards from chipset driver support that was added recently in April.",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was crashed out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5), 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Rafa Nadal experienced his earliest exit from the French Open on Monday, falling 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 in the first round to fourth seed Alexander Zverev. This unexpected defeat has left fans questioning whether the 14-time champion will return to the Grand Slam he has dominated for two decades. The 22-time major champion, who first claimed the Musketeers' Cup in 2005 and last lifted the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury disrupted his career, had hinted that this year might be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros , after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

        "content": "The Kasturba Marg Police in Mumbai arrested a 46-year-old man on Sunday for allegedly impersonating a officer and demanding money from a ration shop owner in Borivali East, the police said. The accused, identified as Wardhan Salunkhe, was produced in court on Monday, where he was remanded to police custody for four days, an official said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Kasturba Marg police, a week ago, Salunkhe had approached 77-year-old Dinanath Kaluste's shop at Shanti Niwas in Borivali East and threatened to fine him Rs. 1 lakh, accusing him of selling ration illegally. Kaluste pleaded with Salunkhe not to impose the fine, at which point Salunkhe demanded Rs. 20,000. Kaluste negotiated and paid Salunkhe Rs. 10,000 after Salunkhe flashed his ID card, the police said. On Sunday, Salunkhe returned to Kaluste's shop and began recording a video on his mobile phone, accusing Kaluste of irregularities. This time, Kaluste sensed foul play and asked Salunkhe to show his ID card again. \"Kaluste saw that the government stamp on the ID card was missing, which raised his suspicion,\" said a officer. Kaluste then gathered a few other rationing shop owners, who discovered that there was no one named Wardhan Salunkhe working at the FDA. The shop owners alerted the police, who arrested Salunkhe under sections 420 (cheating) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.",

        "description": "Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker has broken his silence after his commencement speech placed him at the top of headlines for weeks.",
        "content": "The world was left in a tizzy when Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker delivered a commencement speech that was full of socially conservative rhetoric that was called into question. After he referred to women as needing to focus on being wives and raising children instead of entering the workforce and calling Pride Month \"a deadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it,\" the NFL made a statement declaring Butker's \"views are not those of the NFL as an organization.\" Read more: that he believes Butker is a \"good person\" though they are \"not always going to agree on things.\" Head coach Andy Reid offered up a similar sentiment, stating that the NFL is a \"microcosm and everyone has their own beliefs.\" on his \"New Heights Podcast\" stating that he does not agree with what Butker said. There was naturally a huge backlash against Butker's comments, but now the man himself has addressed the speech and how he feels after the whirlwind couple of weeks that followed it. to the speech on Friday night at Regina Caeli Academy's Courage Under Fire gala in Nashville, Tennessee. Butker stated, \"It is now, over the past few days, my beliefs or what people think I believe have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,\" Butker said Friday. \"At the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion.\" \"It's a decision I've consciously made and one I do not regret at all,\" Butker added. The kicker also indicated that he values his religion far more than football. That is good if the league plans to dish out any sort of punishment for what was said. That is likely not going to be the case, as Butker's opinions are his own. But in the highly unlikely scenario that Butker is cut, he is already of the mind that he values and stands by what he said more than playing in the NFL. Butker is a three-time Super Bowl champion with the Chiefs, and the idea would be he would remain on the team to attempt to secure the NFL's first-ever three-peat championship.

During Nicki's concert at the Resorts World Arena in Birmingham, the 41-year-old singer shared her unlikely love for the former Princess of Wales who passed when the rapper was just 14 years old. Nicki channeled her alter-ego Martha Zolanski as she put on a fake British accent and asked the cheering crowd to give a moment of silence for Princess Diana who died 26 years ago. As she took to the stage in her ripped jeans and hot-pink silk gloves, Nicki shouted to the crowd: \"Wales - it always reminds me of a dear friend of mine, well she's not here anymore, but the Princess of Wales. Let's have a moment of silence for her.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .

But despite the connection, Nicki's fans were caught off guard by the dedication, as they took to X, formerly Twitter , sharing their thoughts. One fan joked: \"A dear friend of mine... She was 14 when Diana died...\" And another replied: \"The way the minute's silence was 3 and a half seconds.\" And a third added: \"i was there last night. such a moment.\" Nicki's shoutout comes as she has been making shocking headlines throughout her European tour including being forced to cancel one of her gigs after getting arrested. The US rapper was detained by police in Amsterdam , who arrested her for carrying “soft drugs” – something she adamantly denied on social media. During her run-in with the police, Nicki was forced to spend five to six hours in a jail cell before being released without charge. After her time behind bars, the Bang Bang singer was late to board her flight to the UK which resulted in her missing her show at Manchester's Co-Op Live Arena. But although Nicki couldn't make it in time for her show, she made sure to still do something special for her dedicated fans. On Sunday evening, Nicki held an impromptu meet and greet at her hotel room where she apologized and met some of her Barbz. * Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube a nd Threads .",

        "content": "Nigerians have taken to the microblogging site X.com to express their shock, anger, and disbelief over the brutal death of Alex Timileyi, a 200-level engineering student at the Ajayi Crowther University in Oyo State, who was clubbed to death by his colleague on Saturday over a claim that he stole a mobile phone. The student was allegedly beaten to death inside a hostel known as Shepherd Inn on the school premises. After he was allegedly discovered in possession of the stolen cell phone, PRIMANEWS Metro reported that his attackers had allegedly had his (the deceased) hair forcibly shaved. A source in the school who spoke on condition of anonymity with our correspondent because of the sensitivity of the matter claimed that the deceased was beaten from 6 p.m. on Friday to about 10 a.m. on Saturday. “They said they caught him with a stolen phone. They started beating him from 6 p.m. yesterday (Friday) until he died at about 10 a.m. today (Saturday). “The incident happened at ‘Shepherd Inn’. It’s like a lodge or a hostel now. They also shaved the hair of the guy before beating him,” he said. Two different videos that were shared with our correspondent on Saturday night showed the deceased rolling on the hostel floor while other students were beating him with sticks. In one of the videos, one of the students could be heard encouraging the other students to smack the deceased “harder, harder.” The varsity said on Saturday that it had expelled some of the students who had been involved in the incident that resulted in their colleague’s death as a prompt response to the situation while also dismissing the claim that the suspects were members of a cult group. The school, through its spokesperson, Femi Atoyebi, described the incident as “the unfortunate death of the student.” The varsity stated, “Contrary to what is trending, the university affirms that there is no cultism in the institution, just as the university has zero tolerance for any sort of anti-social vices and misconduct. It is important to stress that the expelled students do not belong to any cult group. “What actually happened is that the deceased was alleged to have stolen a mobile telephone, but instead of reporting the issue to the university management, the expelled students could not control their emotions. Their actions led to the unfortunate death of the student. “The university has taken swift action by handing over all the students involved to the Nigeria Police Force for investigation, with the assurance that justice will be served.” However, Nigerians have continued to demand thorough investigation and justice for the slain student. Leading the pack is an activist of Itsekiri in the Warri Kingdom, identified as @Lord_of_Warri, who, in a letter titled, “An open letter to His Excellency, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State: Regarding the tragic murder of Prince Alex Timileyi of the Warri Kingdom at Crowther University, Oyo State,” described the slain student as a prince and a first cousin to the Olú of Warri Kingdom, Ogíamè Atuwatsé III. The letter was copied to the X.com handles of the state governor, the Nigeria Police, President Bola Tinubu, and the Department of State Services, among others. The activist lamented that the death of the student had left an indelible mark on the Itsekiri people, urging the governor to “ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice.” The tweet partly read, “This incident has left us deeply saddened and concerned about the safety and security of students in schools not just in Oyo State but in Nigeria as a whole. As Itsekiri people, we appeal to you, the Governor of Oyo State, Makinde, to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice.” He demanded that security operatives “conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and ensure that justice is served. The perpetrators of this heinous act must be held accountable and face the full wrath of the law. We cannot allow the murder of an Itsekiri prince to go unpunished. “It is important for His Excellency to know that the Yoruba and Itsekiri people are one and the same. Allowing these murderers to go free would be equivalent to allowing the killers of your family members to go unpunished, without seeking justice.” @Jessica_Egbedi wrote, “Now he’s dead, so sad... Why didn’t they just hand him over to the school authority?” “I feel traumatised watching this video. There is no difference between them (the suspects) and Boko Haram. I think tyranny and lawlessness are prevalent traits in an average Nigerian. “We may not have confidence in @PoliceNG to meet justice, but that does not justify taking the law into our hands,” @Jojo_Amandy partly wrote. Also, @FaventM posted, “The ‘leaders’ of tomorrow. Most are born into comfort but lack basic etiquette. From the ghetto to the affluent environment, it is all cocktails of bad behavior; they only differ in forms and shapes.” Another tweep who posts by name @HENRYDAVIE10116 said, “This is not a good image for the Anglican Church University. I am sure that the church’s fathers will sanction the management and carry out a thorough investigation into the management of the hostels and student affairs in the university.”",

        "content": "Anton Du Beke 'is hugely standing by' Giovanni Pernice as the pair begin rehearsals for their new live show after pro dancer quit Strictly amid 'serious misconduct' probe By Rebecca Davison for MailOnline Published: 12:20 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 13:11 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 42 shares 30 View comments Anton Du Beke 'is hugely standing by' Giovanni Pernice after he quit Strictly Come Dancing amid the BBC's 'serious misconduct' probe. The pair are appearing together in a live show called Giovanni and Anton Together: The Live Tour, which will begin in June and last until the end of July - and the duo began rehearsals on Monday. Giovanni posted a video of the pair on his Instagram Stories and the accompanying promo photo shows the two men hugging one another, showing they are the best of friends. Anton opened the clip by saying: 'First day of rehearsals, always my favourite day. Second day, less so,' to which Giovanni laughed. Giovanni, who was smiling and appeared in good spirits, continued: 'Because we have to remember everything about day one. We are back on tour. It feels nice.' Anton Du Beke 'is hugely standing by' Giovanni Pernice after he quit Strictly Come Dancing amid the BBC's 'serious misconduct' probe Giovanni posted a video of the pair on his Instagram Stories on Monday and the accompanying promo photo shows the two men hugging one another, showing they are the best of friends Anton opened the clip by saying: 'First day of rehearsals, always my favourite day. Second day, less so,' to which Giovanni laughed The news comes as it emerged a n investigation was launched into claims surrounding Giovanni's behaviour on Strictly Come Dancing. Giovanni, 33, has been hit by a string of allegations from former celebrity partners on the BBC show, with the channel forced to investigate 'serious workplace misconduct claims' after three of his celebrity partners sought legal help. A source told The Mirror : 'This has been a really difficult time for Giovanni but the tour with Anton is going ahead. 'There is no reason for it to be cancelled or even postponed. Gio has not been found guilty of anything, though he is the subject of much speculation. 'The Back Together tour will go ahead, and he and Anton will be standing up on stage together as they have done for many tours.' Meanwhile, the BBC has reportedly pulled the plug on their travel series. It's been claimed that despite hinting on social media that a second series could be in the works, BBC bosses have told Giovanni that his Adventures With show with Anton will not be renewed. It comes after it was revealed he is 'fully co-operating' with the BBC's investigation, and has launched a fight back by legal firm Schillings. Giovanni and Anton's tour will still go ahead, after an investigation was launched into claims surrounding his behaviour on Strictly Come Dancing Meanwhile, the BBC has reportedly pulled the plug on their travel series, Adventures With... Giovanni has been hit by a string of allegations from former celebrity partners on the BBC show, with the channel forced to investigate 'serious workplace misconduct claims' after three of his celebrity partners sought legal help A source said: 'This has been a really difficult time for Giovanni but the tour with Anton is going ahead. There is no reason for it to be cancelled or even postponed. Gio has not been found guilty of anything, though he is the subject of much speculation' It comes after it was revealed he is 'fully co-operating' with the BBC's investigation, and has launched a fight back by legal firm Schillings Schillings confirmed they had been hired by Giovanni after his former dancer Amanda Abbington and two other women instructed lawyers at Carter Ruck to complain to the BBC A source told The Sun: 'Giovanni and Anton had conversations about another travel show and had discussed where they could go next after their trips to Sicily and Spain . 'But Giovanni has now been told this won't be happening and there will not be another series. 'It's embarrassing because he'd actively hinted about getting another run but all discussions are off and he's been told the show is on the scrap heap now.' Giovanni has also signed with talent agency Off Limits in a bid to rebuild his profile, after multiple Strictly co-stars remained silent on the claims he's facing. On Wednesday, Schillings confirmed they had been hired by the troubled Strictly dancer, in what television insiders describe as a 'bold move' after his former dancer Amanda Abbington and two other women instructed lawyers at Carter Ruck to complain to the BBC. Read More The TRUTH behind the Giovanni Pernice scandal: Insiders reveal how the BBC 'thought Amanda Abbington was a troublemaker' and the Strictly bosses' big regret, while Gio's friends break their silence to KATIE HIND Schillings insisted Giovanni will 'clear his name' and 'fully co-operate.' In a statement to The Mail, they said: 'Giovanni... has instructed Schillings International LLP. 'Schillings is engaging with BBC studios to provide it with Giovanni's evidence to strongly rebut claims being made about him and confirm that Giovanni is fully cooperating with that process. 'As with any reality TV show, when decisions are being made for entertainment reasons, the producers have a duty of care. 'Giovanni is fully committed to clearing his name and defending his rep against accusations against him.' The move, some say, means 'war' after Amanda claimed at the weekend Giovanni has left her bruised after stamping on her foot. A source close to Giovanni said: 'Giovanni has instructed Schillings and is clear he will not be cancelled by spurious and unfounded allegations In the press. 'He has faith in the process and is fully participating, that is the right and proper forum for all the allegations to be made and reviewed. 'He is confident he will clear his name, the only substantive allegation is that he stepped on someone else's toes - an occupational hazard dancing professionally or at a wedding. 'Giovanni has made no secret that he is a hard taskmaster, that's what is required on Strictly. 'But he has and will deny any allegations of threatening or abusive behaviour.' Just over a week ago, The Mail revealed that Giovanni parted company with Strictly three weeks ago amid the BBC launching an investigation into his conduct after a group of his former dance partners instructed lawyers to make 'serious complaints' over his conduct. The BBC are reportedly scouring nine years of footage from Giovanni's training sessions, with it previously claimed bosses fear more contestants could come forward with complaints Giovanni suddenly removed Strictly from his future work schedule shortly after he was given a contract by the show's bosses which he had intended to sign. But now they have been forced to gather evidence after lawyers served three separate grievances to them by three separate women over Giovanni's behaviour. In recent days, former Strictly contestants Ellie Leach reportedly unfollowed Giovanni after he rejected any allegations of 'threatening and abusive' behaviour. Read More Ellie Leach and Ellie Simmonds are the latest stars to 'snub' Giovanni Pernice as former Strictly stars 'unfollow' the professional dancer amid BBC probe into 'abusive behaviour' following contestant's complaints Leach's former dance partner Vito Coppola has also reportedly hit the unfollow button, according to The Mirror. Giovanni has also seemingly lost the support of his Strictly partner Rose Ayling-Ellis, who has stayed silent amid the claims. It was believed Giovanni was still on good terms with Rose, who he won Strictly Come Dancing with in 2021. But, in recent days it's been claimed by sources that Rose is 'shocked' by the allegations but 'believes what the others are saying' and 'won't be speaking about it publicly.' Giovanni brushed off the scandal surrounding his Strictly Come Dancing exit as he proudly posed with his new puppy last Wednesday. He has recently returned from a trip to Dubai and Portugal with girlfriend Molly Brown. There was no reference to the current media storm Pernice finds himself in, following claims that Strictly bosses are bracing themselves for yet more complaints from former contestants. The BBC are reportedly scouring nine years of footage from Strictly professional Pernice's training sessions, as the explosive show scandal continues to rumble on. It's also claimed that Amanda has vowed to leave 'nothing unsaid' in her meeting with investigators this week. Read More The TRUTH behind the Giovanni Pernice scandal: Insiders reveal how the BBC 'thought Amanda Abbington was a troublemaker' and the Strictly bosses' big regret, while Gio's friends break their silence to KATIE HIND On Monday evening, industry colleague Korina Travis, who performed with Pernice at private functions and has no association with Strictly, accused the Italian dancer of behaving questionably when they worked together. 'I've known him for years as a fellow competitor and he has done horrendous things to me,' she said in a statement. She added: 'I will not speak about my experiences with him... I'll leave it at that.' Travis works for ballroom company Burn The Floor alongside numerous former Strictly Come Dancing professionals. She was previously considered for a role on the BBC show in 2016 before producers opted for Chloe Hewitt. According to The Sun , several women who have danced with the Italian on Strictly are contemplating joining the three existing claimants in a Beeb investigation for 'serious workplace misconduct claims'. A source disclosed that several former dance partners of Pernice's have been communicating privately and suggested that even more names could come forward. Giovanni brushed off the scandal surrounding his Strictly Come Dancing exit as he proudly posed with his new puppy last Wednesday The source went on to say that the future is unclear for the professional dancer, who vehemently denies any claims of threatening or abusive behaviour and has vowed to 'clear his name.' They revealed: 'Numerous celebrities, all former partners of Gio's, have been in contact with one another behind the scenes. 'Three women that we know of have come forward, and taken things a step further with legal action. 'But Carter Ruck, the prestigious firm acting on behalf of these stars, have quietly been speaking to one or two other potential claimants. In other words, more names could come out of the woodwork.' The fresh claims come after the professional dancer reportedly quit Strictly after the scrutiny became 'too much'. Off the back of Giovanni's departure, friends close to Amanda spoke about how she found the pro dancer 'abrasive' and would have to have 'crisis talks' with show bosses every week after being left in floods of tears at his 'tough' training method with claims it left her 'bruised '. Amanda, who dramatically withdrew from last year's competition and was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the show, is said to have met with Whitmore and Singh, 46, earlier this year for an 'emotional summit' to 'compare notes' about their time working with him. Giovanni shared a post to Instagram detailing that he was 'totally surprised' by the allegations, which he denies. Pernice faced further claims of workplace misconduct on Monday evening after professional dancer Korina Travis accused him of 'horrendous' behaviour He said in a statement: 'You will be as surprised as I am that allegations have been made about my dance teaching methods in the media this week. 'Of course, I reject any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour, and I look forward to clearing my name. 'Those who have followed my journey on Strictly Come Dancing over the last decade will know that I am passionate and competitive. No-one is more ambitious for my dance partners than me. 'I have always striven to help them be the very best dancers they can be. This has always come from a place of love and wanting to win - for me and my dance partners. 'Thank you all once again for your continued love and support!' Read More EXCLUSIVE Giovanni Pernice is seen for the first time in Portugal since quitting Strictly after fleeing the country amid BBC probe into 'serious workplace misconduct claims' Now, Pernice looks set to be planning a whole new career after leaving Strictly under a cloud. Last month, the professional dancer quietly set up two new companies, which suggest that he's embarking on a life outside of the BBC show and heading for the classroom. The Latin and Ballroom champion filed Rock You Productions Ltd at Companies House, which relates to the 'operation of arts facilities'. This suggests that he's making a move to create his own dance school, similar to ones set up by other performers such as Kevin Clifto n. Giovanni's new business is with Paul Irving, who produced his and other Strictly stars' tours. Paul is also the founder member of The Strictly Foundation, set up to 'raise funds to place talented youth in stage schools and arts training courses'. Giovanni's second firm is called GP Ballando and the nature of its business is 'cultural education'. Debbie Lee serves as director after working with Giovanni and other Strictly celebs on their dance classes. Last year, Pernice turned his hand away from dancing to set up his own cosmetics range GP Vita, selling fragrances for men and women. He announced on Instagram at the time that 'my dream come true is finally here!' adding: 'VITA is my new fragrance for men and women - an intoxicating scent that captures the sensuality, vitality and energy of Sicily.' The professional dancer shared a post to Instagram detailing that he was 'totally surprised' by the allegations, which he denies As well as teaching, Pernice could be set for a career in Hollywood. The dancer is set to make his film debut this year with insiders predicting he'll 'have more acting roles coming his way. Pernice has filmed a role in Man & Witch - a heart-warming homage to the lo-fi fantasy films of the Eighties. While Strictly fans may miss seeing him every weekend in the ballroom, there might not be that long to wait to see him back on the small screen. Insiders confirmed that Pernice is already mulling over offers away from BBC and he would find it 'difficult to resist' a lucrative contract with jungle show I'm A Celeb .

        "content": "The Benue State House of Assembly has repealed the law for lifetime pension and other benefits of former elected governors and their deputies. Recall that few days to the end of the last assembly, lawmakers passed the controversial pension bill to extend benefits to ex-elected governors and their deputies from 1999. Titus Uba, the 2023 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was the speaker of the assembly. But, during plenary on Monday, May 27, 2024, the assembly repealed the bill passed into law by their predecessors on account that it was not done in good faith. The lawmakers said the law was anti-people and they were unanimous in support of the repeal after several contributions from members of the House. Speaker of the House, Aondona Dajoh, ruled in favour of the unanimous resolution of the House to repeal the “Bill for a law to repeal provision for the maintenance of former elected governors of the state and their deputies and for other matters connected thereto 2024.” The bill had stipulated conditions of the law to include, payment of monthly stipend as basic pensions for former governors and their deputies, equivalent to the current salaries of the serving governor, from the consolidated revenue of the state. Other benefits include: “A monthly stipend equivalent to the basic salary of a serving/incumbent Governor in the State for life and which shall be a charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State. “The deputy governor shall enjoy a monthly stipend equivalent to the Basic salary of an incumbent Deputy Governor for life and shall be charge on the Consolidated Revenue Funds of the State. “A maintenance allowance of N25,000,000.00 (Twentyfive Million Naira) for the former Governor and the Deputy Governor N15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Naira) every four (4) years.” It also offers the “procurement of two official SUVs of the status of the former governor and one official car for the deputy governor while the state government is mandated to avail a former governor with six personal staff, one personal assistant, two drivers, two cleaners and one cook.” A former deputy governor, according to the law, will enjoy three personal staff, one personal assistant, one driver and one cleaner. “There will also be provision of security, yearly medical expenses, replacement of vehicles every four years with new ones of same quality and status,” the old law stipulated.",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Nadal lost for only the fourth time in 116 matches at the clay Major.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 ,7-6(5), 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-time champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-time Major champion, who won the Musketeers’ Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. We love you too Rafa, and we hope to see you again next year 🧡 Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semifinals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

        "content": "Sanda Island, located just off the southern coast of Mull of Kintyre and is in Argyll and Bute, has gone up for sale for a staggering £2.5 million. The stunning island, which is around 453 acres in total, boasts incredible views from its multiple hills - the highest being 23 meters above sea level. Sanda is accessible via boat as it has two slipways, one north and one south on the island, that run out from its beautiful sandy beaches. READ MORE: Private island with stunning scenery nestled in a Scottish loch hits the market Along with the breathtaking views, there are seven cottages on the island, four of which are based at the island's northern end while three are next to the lighthouse in the south. Most of the houses have been renovated by the current owners which includes the installation of double glazing, shower rooms and underfloor electric heating. There are also two smaller islands north of Sanda, Sheep and Glunimore, which are also included in the sale. Sheep Island is the larger of the two at 31 acres while Glunimore Island is just 4 acres, but both offer their own charming scenery and views. The island was previously owned in the 60s by the famous Scottish musician Jack Bruce, who was the lead vocalist and ‍bassist ‍of the iconic rock band Cream. It is now home to some equally incredible wildlife such as Puffins, Storm petrels, Razorbills, Manx shearwaters, Kittiwakes, Gulliemots, Great black-backed gulls, Shags, and Black guilliemot. It even has a small functioning farm which is home to 55 black-faced sheep and has a registered farm code which even receives a subsidy. The seven homes, lighthouse, and farm are all connected by tracks which can be accessed easily by quadbikes and there is even a helipad to help gain access to the island. The beautiful island overlooks the channel between mainland Scotland and Northern Ireland and is mainly accessed from Campbeltown. The lucky next owner will have incredible views of the Antrim Hills and the beautiful beaches on Carskiey. They will even have a unique view of the Isle of Arran.",

        "content": "The Atlanta Braves have confirmed Ronald Acuna Jr will miss the rest of the year after suffering a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The did the damage during the first innings of the ' game Sunday against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Acuna, 26, had his knee buckle during a delayed steal attempt between second and third base. The outfielder screamed while falling into the infield grass after taking a big secondary lead before moving toward third. “I saw the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher very slow,” Acuna recalled through an interpreter in the locker room after the game. “I was timing that so I could steal third. But in that moment, he threw it hard. So I had to come back, and that’s when I felt it.” After gingerly walking off the field, Acuna shared with reporters his belief that it would not be a season-ending setback. \"I got scared a lot because I felt the pain in the beginning,\" Acuña said. \"Hopefully, everything is going to go well this time. [I] don't feel that painful, any pop or anything ... Don't think it's that bad.\" But hours later, after having a scan, the team shared the following update: \"OF Ronald Acuña Jr. tonight underwent an MRI that revealed a complete tear of the ACL in his left knee,\" their statement reads. \"He is set to undergo surgery at a date yet to be determined and will miss the remainder of the 2024 season.\" It will be the second such procedure in three years for Acuna. Midway through the 2021 season, the right fielder suffered the same injury to his right knee while jumping to make a catch. That injury kept Acuna out for nine-and-a-half months. As a rookie, the Atlanta outfielder also sprained his left ACL and missed over a month of the 2018 season before returning to win the NL Rookie of the Year award. He now faces another extended absence and will be aiming to return in time for the start of next season ten months from now. On social media after the announcement, Acuna apologized. \"Sorry,\" he posted on X, formerly , punctuating the post with a broken heart emoji and sleepy face emoji. The Braves have already lost All-Star right-hander Spencer Strider for the season after having the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow surgically repaired with an internal brace. Catcher Sean Murphy also has an oblique injury that has kept him on the 10-day injured list since Opening Day. Braves manager Brian Snitker spoke generally about Atlanta's injury situation before Acuna had his scan. \"I just hate it for the young men that it affects more than us,\" he said postgame. \"These guys love to play the game.

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday.",
        "content": "PARIS — Rafael Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavorable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. — Reuters",

Or you can pick it up from the Ninja website for £79, where it comes with a free two pack of 650ml cups with sleeves, while stock lasts. On Amazon the Ninja Foodi Power Nutri Blender 2-in-1 has a near-perfect overall star-rating of 4.7 out of five from over 1,360 five-star reviews. One shopper said: \"This is a really good blender and takes up much less space than my previous one. It blends smoothies and milkshakes in seconds and crushes ice very well. Both cups feel really thick and strong, and all the moving parts feel so solid. It has already lasted three years and seems like it will last many more.\" A second wrote: This blender is easy to use and has multifunctional features. It crushes, blends and mixes items. I am so excited having it in my kitchen. It makes cooking so much easy and delightful.\" A third penned: \"Best smoothie maker/blender I have ever bought. It feels really sturdy and makes short work of mixing smoothies and shakes as it's very powerful. Worth the bit extra, hopefully will last longer than the cheaper, flimsier ones I've had before.\" Amazon has slashed the Ninja Foodi Power Nutri Blender 2-in-1 to less than £80 (Image: Amazon) \"I recently purchased the Ninja Foodi Power Nutri Blender 2-in-1, and it has completely transformed my cooking and blending experience,\" mentioned another. \"This blender is an absolute game-changer, and I can't sing its praises enough. First and foremost, the power of this blender is unmatched. \"It effortlessly pulverizes even the toughest ingredients, turning them into smooth, creamy concoctions in no time. From frozen fruits to leafy greens, the Ninja Foodi Power Nutri Blender 2-in-1 tackles everything with ease. The 1100 watt motor is a beast and blends everything to perfection.

The included cup is also great for larger batches. It’s also great for drinking straight out of on the go. Another standout feature is the sleek design of this blender. It looks modern and stylish on my countertop, adding a touch of elegance to my kitchen.\" However, one person gave the Ninja Foodi Power Nutri Blender 2-in-1 a three-star review because it can be 'very stiff to lock into place'. They said: \" Works excellently but it is very stiff to lock into place in order for it to work, and if you have rheumatoid arthritis or any form of weakness in your hands, it's not a product for you. There is no grip and you have to push down and twist it into position. When finally done, it works well and blends just about anything. This replaced my old Nutribullet, which was easier to use but noisy. Great product, just wish it was for everyone.\" But another loved their latest Amazon purchase, adding: \"I hesitated to spend so much on this but it was worth it. It's sold, well engineered and worth every penny. It is a joy to use and easy to clean. Best of all, you actually want to make healthy juices so it's not just sitting in your cupboard. Absolutely brilliant.\" Alternatively, the Nutribullet Blender in grey has been slashed to £89.99 from £99.99 at Currys for a limited time. A cheaper option is Amazon's Blender Smoothie Maker which has been discounted to £36.54 from £42.99.",

        "content": "An economist and Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf speaks to DANIEL AYANTOYE about the performance of President Bola Tinubu President Bola Tinubu will be one year in office on May 29, how will you assess his performance? Performance review of one year of the current administration requires proper contextualisation. There were significant legacy issues that significantly impacted performance outcomes, especially from a macroeconomic point of view. There was a legacy of an incredibly dysfunctional foreign exchange market riddled with round-tripping and all manners of malpractices. Secondly, there was a fuel subsidy regime which created opportunities for corruption and bleeding of the country. The state of affairs in the sector was a major disincentive to investors in the downstream oil sector. The sector became a hotbed of corruption of a huge proportion. The huge backlog of mature foreign exchange obligations was more than $7bn. This created a major liquidity crisis in the economy. There was vandalisation of oil production facilities with incredible impunity. The administration has made significant progress in restoring some sanity to the oil-producing areas, even though it is a work in progress. How will you describe the economic impact of some of the policies and reforms introduced by the government since assumption? The truth is that reforms take time to be prepared and executed. It could take an even longer time for the results to be felt. But my view is that the reforms will necessarily pull back the economy from the brink. Much has been achieved with fiscal consolidation. Government revenue has improved significantly following the reforms. There were also tax reform initiatives. The point to stress is that much of the first year was devoted to corrective reforms which were in many instances also painful. But the reforms were inevitable. Will you say the policies have had any significant impact on the economy? They have had an impact because if those policies were not introduced, the economy would have been worse off than what we have now. This is because before he took over, the Central Bank of Nigeria was practically financing the government through the Ways and Means, and that is why the Ways and Means financing got to almost N30tn by the end of that administration. This is why the fiscal space for the government was extremely very tight because we are spending almost 80 per cent of our revenue on subsidy. Not just subsidy, but even corruption is also related to the subsidy. So, the reforms that have been introduced, has helped us to improve the fiscal space. Government has more revenue and the FAAC has increased; almost tripled, and the need to borrow from the CBN has reduced. The level of deficit is likely to go down. From a revenue or fiscal consolidation point of view, there has been a remarkable movement from where we were. Then all the challenges of the foreign exchange market and corruption in the foreign exchange market; all of those things reduced drastically. Investors now have a lot more confidence. The administration has been able to clear the backlog of maturing obligations in the foreign exchange market which was also creating a confidence crisis before the administration came. So, those things have had some good impact. But I must admit that they have also come with a lot of hardship through the high prices of commodities, the high cost of fuel, and transportation costs. Well, there is a price for everything. That is the price we have to pay at least to bring the economy back on track. The hardship has put many into abject poverty. Why do you think it is difficult for previous and current administrations to put an end to the suffering of the people or bring it to a bearable level? It is not easy because one of the biggest problems in poverty is inflation. Since inflation is still high, purchasing power will be weak. People will not be able to consume much. That is why it is good for the government to focus on economic stability bringing down inflation. The second thing is the issue of food insecurity. Insecurity is a major problem as far as food production is concerned because if the farmers are not producing enough, how can they sell at a cheaper rate? These are problems that the government is trying to solve and these are not things that you can solve very quickly. There is no quick fix to them. Do you think the situation could have been better handled than this? The administration could do better about the speed of delivering mitigating measures to ease the pains of the reforms. There is also the need to address the volatility in the foreign exchange market. Frequent swings in the exchange rate are very detrimental to business because of the uncertainty that comes with it. The CBN should also address the frequent changes in the exchange rate for import duty computation. Subsidy removal, electricity tariff hike, and taxation are some of the policies that Nigerians have described as anti-people. What is your take on this? My take is that the government has set up a tax reform committee. I think we should wait for the outcome of the report of that committee. One of the mandates given to the committee is to streamline the taxes so that you can put an end to the multiple taxations. Let’s see what comes out of that report. The committee has finished its assignment and they are about to present their report to the President. I am sure the outcome will address some of these issues. Do we need electricity tariffs to increase at this time? That is a chicken and egg situation because the electricity people are saying that they are not able to cover their costs. Therefore they are not able to invest in infrastructure and things that will ensure steady power. The citizens are complaining that the burden on them is too much. So, it is a tricky situation. That will require some government intervention to see how we can have a balance. However, the electricity company needs to invest more equity into the business because some of them don’t have that capacity, and it is also important to address the inefficiency problem in the electricity sector. At the same time, the tariff must be such that the electricity sector is sustainable. Three years ahead for the first tenure of President Tinubu. What is the way forward? The way forward is for us to first address this issue of cost of living. That is extremely very important because citizens are still groaning because of the high cost of living. He will have to look at bringing down the cost of living, the cost of transportation, and particularly the cost of food. We need to accelerate the process to ensure that we increase the oil output so that oil production can come close to at least 1.8 or 1.2 million barrels per day. If we can do that, we will be able to get more foreign exchange to stablise our currency. The government needs to do more about insecurity which is a major issue to investors. We know they are doing something but they need to do a lot more. Then the Central Bank needs to do more frameworks to ensure some measure of stability in the foreign exchange market. We need to reduce the volatility in the market. Finally, we need to fix the customs duty exchange rate so that we can reduce the duty on clearing cargo at the ports.",

        "content": "Holidaymakers LOCKED OUT: Menorca resort shuts out sightseers with chains across its picturesque alleyways which attract 800,000 visitors a year to the village of 500 people in latest anti-tourist move By Perkin Amalaraj Published: 09:21 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:31 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 48 shares 399 View comments Furious Menorcan residents living in a resort town known as ' Spain 's Mykonos' have chained up their streets in their latest bid to stop holidaymakers intruding on their private properties. The nearly 200 homeowners of Binibeca Vell, which lies on the south of the island of Menorca, say they do not want any visitors before 11am or after 8pm. Anti-tourist signs attached to thick rope and chains have been hung up throughout the holiday hotspot. Locals have long complained of rowdy tourists disrespecting their homes by climbing stairs, scaling private balconies and even entering doorways to locals' homes as they hunt for picture perfect spots. Binibeca, famed for its whitewashed cottages and twisting alleys, can accommodate just 500 permanent residents in the summer, but every year around 800,000 tourists pile in and cause havoc for locals. But recent images show the small town almost completely deserted as several alleyways have ropes and chains hanging between the entrances with round signs indicating no trespassers. The nearly 200 homeowners of Binibeca Vell say they do not want any visitors before 11am and after 8pm Known for its whitewashed cottages and twisting walkways, Binibeca can only accommodate 500 permanent residents in the summer Nearly 800,000 people visit the town every year The new blockades are Binibeca's first anti-tourist measure before residents take a vote on whether to ban holidaymakers altogether in August, The Telegraph reported. Read More Anti-tourism protest organisers vow 'This is just the start' after holidaymakers are booed and abused by 15,000-strong mob as they ate evening meals in Majorca Óscar Monge, president of the residents association, blamed Menorca's authorities for failing to regulate tourism in the area and leaving locals to take matters into their own hands. He said: 'Binibeca is promoted by the administration and tourism companies, but what benefit do we get out of it? 'We pay dearly for being the most potent tourist attraction in Menorca'. The residents organisation receives €25,000 annually to repair and touch up the outside painting of the town's houses but Monge believes the amount is insufficient and has demanded a plan to manage the area sustainably. He said: 'It's outrageous that the politicians who run local tourism are telling us that the only alternatives we have to keep the place clean are to close it, privatise it or start charging.' In a post on Binibeca's website, locals asked visitors to refrain from 'entering homes' and 'climbing balconies'. A popular Menorcan resort known as 'Spain's Mykonos' has chained up its streets to prevent holidaymakers from overcrowding them as they take selfies Binibeca Vell is a popular holiday hotspot because of its winding alleyways and whitewashed homes Angry locals have attached no trespassing signs to ropes and chains around the town n a bid to deter visitors Read More Britain's ambassador to Spain urges UK holidaymakers in Magaluf to 'show responsibility' in wake of Majorca's clampdown on booze-fuelled tourists The message included a series of pictures showing one tourist splayed out on a stairwell and another sitting in a chair belonging to one of the locals. There are 1.2million permanent people in the Balearic Islands, which are home to Menorca, the smaller neighbour of popular tourist destinations Majorca and Ibiza. In 2023, the islands saw about 18million tourists arrive, hitting a record for the archipelago. And 14.4million of these were foreign visitors, the majority of whom were Germans and Brits. It comes as Brits headed to Majorca this Bank Holiday weekend faced major disruption as thousands of people took to the streets in anti-tourist protests. The protests were held on Saturday evening, starting at 7pm, and were centred on the capital of Palma. Organisers said they were astounded by the number of groups and organisations which had pledged their support. 'Initially, we thought there would be about 2,000 people but now it is going to be considerably more,' said a spokesman for the organising group, Banc de Temps de Sencelles. Last week, a group under the slogan 'Més turisme, menys vida', which translates to 'More tourism, less life' said it intended to cause chaos at Palma Airport over the coming weekend. Recent images show the idyllic town almost completely deserted Óscar Monge, president of the residents association, blamed Menorca's authorities for failing to regulate tourism in the area and leaving locals to take matters into their own hands Binibeca can only accommodate 500 permanent residents in the summer, but every year some 800,000 tourists pile into its pristine alleyways Read More Majorca's war on tourism: 9.30pm alcohol curfew is needed to make Magaluf safer, says mayor, as Palma now vows to bring in tougher measures to lower tourist numbers Mes is calling for a reduction in the number of flights at Palma airport, saying: 'Majorca is no longer overcrowded, Majorca is experiencing collapse. You cannot have airports that, year after year, break records.' The Balearic government says it is willing to change the tourist model and has started a round of talks with the public. As yet, no concrete measures have been agreed. Banc de Temps de Sencelles has labelled its campaign 'Majorca is not for sale!' and is so surprised by the promised support that it has asked the government to lay on more buses and trains so people from all over the island can attend. 'The demonstration aims to highlight the problem of access to housing in Mallorca, a general problem, but not isolated, because it cannot be separated from tourist saturation, the purchase of properties by foreigners,' said Carme Reynés of Banc de Temps de Sencelles. The group says the protest will be followed by 'other actions' over the coming weeks. Your browser does not support iframes. Protesters flood the streets of Tenerife last month (pictured), calling on local authorities to temporarily limit visitor numbers to alleviate pressure on the islands' environment, infrastructure and housing stock, and put curbs on property purchases by foreigners 'Tourist Go Home' is seen scrawled in English over a wall underneath a real estate promotion billboard in Nou Llevant, Majorca, a neighbourhood that has seen a massive influx of foreign buyers over the past few years. It is one of many instances of anti-tourism graffiti Protests in Majorca come after more than 50,000 people took to the streets of Tenerife back in April to protest against tourism on the island in the Canaries. Demonstrators were seeing brandishing 'you enjoy, we suffer' placards, claiming that the huge influx of tourists to the island is causing major environmental damage, driving down wages and squeezing locals out of cheap affordable housing, forcing dozens to live in tents and cars instead. British visitors to Tenerife are also set to be hit with a controversial 'tourist tax' from next year, local authorities recently confirmed. The proposal is part of the island's new tourism strategy and is seen as an eco tax, but the level of charge and the formalities are yet to be agreed by Parliament. It will apply to all of Tenerife's most famous protected sites, including the volcano Mount Teide and several rural parks and hamlets like Masca. A spokesman for the Tenerife government said the introduction of this eco tax was necessary due to the vast increase of people visiting protected sites, visitors and locals alike. Travellers aged 16 and over already pay a daily charge of up to €4 (£3.45) when visiting the equally popular Balearic islands, such as Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza.

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Mycocycle uses fungi to break down construction waste into raw materials that can be used to create ... [+] fillers, foams and other products that can be put back into the supply chain. The bioremediation process helps to decarbonize the supply chain. In 2011, the Finnish robotics company ZenRobotics tackled waste management with their robotic waste sorter. A Chicago-based science tech company, Mycocycle , has turned to nature to manage waste and is training fungi to break down and detoxify demolition and construction materials. With a recent oversubscribed round of $3.6 million, the company has raised a total of $7.3 million, including investors from Closed Loop Partners' Ventures Group, TELUS Pollinator Fund for Good, US Venture, Inc., and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity INVENT Fund. Joanne Rodriguez, CEO and founder of Mycocycle, said fungi are natural cleaners and builders. \"They're really good at breaking down a wide variety of organic materials, which made them the perfect solution for a tricky problem,\" said Rodriguez. The idea came to Rodriguez when she had to start a recycling program at a roofing company. \"I quickly realized it was a near-impossible task: less than four percent of all roofing materials were recycled. I knew we had a problem,\" said Rodriguez. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50% Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone Rodriguez says she didn't realize that fungi would be the solution at first. \"I took a course in permaculture design from Oregon State University and was fascinated by the power of fungi—specifically their ability to transform waste into low-carbon material.\" \"After speaking with citizen scientists and trailblazing mycologists, all passionate about fungi's untapped potential to help us improve societal and ecological health, I knew I was on the right track,\" said Rodriguez. \"From there, I combined old shingles and fungal spores in a bucket, filed a patent right away, and started my journey toward founding Mycocycle.\" Mycocycle's bioremediation process blends the treatment with built-environment waste such as asphalt shingles, rubber, gypsum boards, insulation lining and old textiles. It then transforms that waste into non-toxic, high-quality raw materials. \"I was looking for a natural solution to a very human problem, and mycology quickly became the obvious choice,\" added Rodriguez. Circularity in waste management Repurposing waste into raw materials for new products Mycocycle's circular waste-to-value system diverts some of the roughly 145 million tons of construction debris sent to landfills annually. This process decarbonizes a market responsible for close to a third of the US's annual greenhouse gas emissions. Mycocycle uses fungi as the tech to break down and detoxify the waste materials and produces harvestable raw materials that can be used in products such as industrial fillers, fibers or foams. \"Our process mirrors how fungi operate in nature: we create an environment in which they'll thrive and then let them get to work,\" said Rodriguez. \"We're focused on mycelium, the root-like structure of the fungi. The mycelium's hyphae, or root-like structures, break down carbon-based molecules—like paper, rubber or nylon.\" Rodriquez says fungi don't need sterile, lab-based environments. \"We can help our customers use fungi to break down and detoxify waste materials at their own demolition and construction sites,\" said Rodriguez. Customers host a mobile bioprocessor called a MYCOntainer. The containers have everything the mycelium needs—food, water and a comfortable climate. In the container, Mycocyle mixes waste fragments with the mycelium treatment and lets the fungi go to work for two weeks. “For some waste types, like carpet, we treat them at the same cost of incineration and other harmful disposal methods,” said Rodriguez. “There is no waste in nature and fungi can grow in almost any environment around the globe. “We make an environment in which they can thrive and then get out of their way—it’s as basic as brewing beer — we’re just making a strange brew,” added Rodriguez. Construction materials manufacturing accounts for 11 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions globally. Rodriguez says that means there is a massive market for the company. “The tide is turning toward accepting and acting on sustainability. We’re already working with some of the biggest construction, industrial and manufacturing companies to create a true waste-to-value chain in a circular economy.” The next Mycology generation Students use Mycology to investigate environmental improvements and nutrition Two high school seniors at Plano West High School in Plano, Texas, used fungi in award-winning science projects. Yizhen Zhang and Zaynab Abbas, both 17, used mycology to decompose complex harmful pollutants that could serve as an incentive for textile manufacturing regions to clean dye pollution in their waterways. Their project, Pathogen to Ally: Evaluating Armillaria Species in Mycoremediation—A Novel Study in Optimal Fungal Mechanisms for Breakdown of Complex Hydrocarbons, took third place at the 2024 Texas Science & Engineering Fair at Texas A&M University . Both students have come in first for the past two years at the Dallas Regional Science and Engineering Fair at Southern Methodist University. “Mycology has significant potential to impact healthcare and environmental clean-up,” said Zhang. “However, to maximize this potential, we must promote greater public interest and awareness without stigma. Increasing public knowledge about the benefits and possibilities of mycology can inspire younger generations to pursue careers in this field, leading to more innovations and advancements.” Raina Hassan and Jerusha Abraham, their classmates, used mycology to repurpose agricultural waste to increase the nutritional value of pink oyster mushrooms for application in regions with scarce food supplies. Their project, The Effects of Agro-waste Substrates in the Gallic Acid Content of Pleurotus Djamor, was a finalist at the Texas Science & Engineering Fair in 2024. “Our project, similar to Mycocycle, involved using fungi to eat waste for a larger purpose,” said Abraham. “However, instead of repurposing the waste into raw materials, our project focused on using our knowledge of the overlooked nutrients found in these waste materials to manipulate the fungi’s nutritional composition.” Abraham, who plans to study biomedical engineering in college, says that looking at overlooked nutrients in agro-waste materials is a further testament to the versatility of fungi and how they can be utilized to solve real-world problems. “Mycology is such an overlooked and under-researched field despite its many applications,” said Abraham. “I’d like to see mycology be more recognized around the world because more knowledge about fungi can help further the existing research and use fungi to create new innovations to help combat issues like pollution, climate change, and disease.” Decarbonizing the construction supply chain Fungi store one-third of the carbon in the soil “They were the creators and facilitators of the greatest ecosystems on earth,” said Rodriguez. “As we continue to adapt their technology to our man-made issues, we believe this will be the ingredient of the future—lowering carbon emissions around the world.” Mycocycle’s output is not a finished product but a biobased raw material that goes into creating a product. “Think fillers, fibers and foams,” said Rodriquez. “These raw materials require less energy to go to market, and they’re more sustainable than their counterparts made from plastic polymers or petroleum chemicals.” Rodriquez says the company sells the raw materials to manufacturers who make the product. “We’re just feeding into it — and decarbonizing the construction material supply chain.” Fungi exploration “The most exciting thing about mycology is that there’s still so much to explore in the field,” said Rodriguez. “The applications are endless—from healthcare to agriculture, to CPGs and biotechnology—we’re only scratching the surface of what fungi can do.” Mycocycle says they are building a platform company extending beyond circular treatments for construction and industrial waste. “We anticipate the ability to address other waste issues like textiles as we grow and how we work with fungi to lead the way for others to develop biobased solutions for the future.” “Using nature to fix problems plaguing the natural world is a really beautiful thing because it reduces the further harm caused by man-made or chemical solutions, said Abraham. “Not only that, but fungi are such an overlooked food source, and its abundance of nutrients and fast-growing pace can help regions struggling with food insecurity.” Zhang, who plans to major in Biology, Microbiology, and Immunology in college, says Mycology has already begun to change the world in areas such as pollution clean-up, alternative food sources and materials, and medicine. “In addition to its current uses, I see many new avenues for Mycology start-up companies in the future, including biocomputers and sensors, as well as new antibiotics.” Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Mad Max: Will There Be Another Movie Sequel After Furiosa & Fury Road? By With the recent release of , fans of the franchise are curious if there will be another movie. Some are also wondering whether this would be a sequel to Furiosa or a sequel to 2015’s . Ever since its inception in 1979, the post-apocalyptic action franchise has garnered great acclaim from critics and film fans in general. So will the story of Mad Max’s world continue? Are there any more films planned? Here is everything that is currently known. Will there be another Mad Max movie sequel after Furiosa and Fury Road? There could be more Mad Max movies according to George Miller, who mentioned that “There’s certainly more stories there,” in a recent appearance at the Cannes Film Festival press conference for Furiosa. However, as per , he also mentioned that the box office success of Furiosa and positive audience reception were key factors in deciding whether another Mad Max sequel would be made, saying “I’ll definitely see how this goes.” How many more Mad Max movies will there be? There are reportedly two Mad Max movies in development. One is Mad Max: The Wasteland, which is reportedly a prequel set before the events of Fury Road, which has been scripted, according to Deadline. As per , there is also another more mysterious movie that could be eyed for development, which could possibly cover what happens to Furiosa after the events of Fury Road. However, neither of these movies has been confirmed as of writing. It is also currently unknown if will reprise his role from Fury Road in The Wasteland, though the actor previously mentioned being contracted to do it and three more movies in a 2017 interview. ComingSoon will provide updates on any future official Mad Max announcements when they arrive. Abdul Naushad is a Contributing SEO Writer for ComingSoon.

        "content": "AL-Latiff Tetteh Amanor, the Ningo-Prampram District Chief Executive (DCE), says the assembly was clearing squatters from agricultural lands as they are hindering agricultural activities in the area. Mr Amanor said the lands in Dawhenya were fertile and could do all-year farming, hence the need to preserve them for the area to contribute its quota to the agricultural sector of the country. He said this during the commissioning of 100 hectares of land for a rice seed project, an initiative by the South Korea Agricultural Ministry in collaboration with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana, aimed at producing high-quality rice seeds in the country. The DCE mentioned that he had been in talks with the Traditional Council on steps to take to preserve the agricultural lands in the district to create farming jobs and support the local economy. “I have been telling the traditional rulers that all our lands can’t go in for concrete; I mean estate projects, so our district is wholeheartedly supporting Agric and agricultural projects,” he stated. He pledged that all government projects regarding agriculture would be sustained, stressing that the district had taken it upon itself to chase the encroaches out of the district. Nene Tetteh Kodie Aden IV, Chief of Dawhenya, said the Dawhenya Irrigation Scheme had been of great benefit to the farmers and the various communities in the district at large. “For some of us, the Dawhenya Irrigation Scheme has been some oxygen to our lives since the very day we visited this earth till now; for that matter, we’ll do everything within our power and our means to ensure that the scheme is sustained,” he stated. He stated that the people of Dawhenya were glad to have had their agriculture sector enhanced by the Korean K-Ricebelt outfit and thanked them for the huge investment they were injecting into the Ghanaian economy. He pleaded with the government to intervene in the threat being posed to the farmlands by the encroaches and appealed to the authorities and the Korean Embassy to extend their support to education, health, and sanitation to spread development in the entire district.",

        "content": "Alstom – Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen-powered train in service in the Americas, finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Alstom, global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, announced today that , the first hydrogen-powered train in revenue service in the Americas, ranked finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas list highlights ambitious projects that are helping shape the world. “We are proud that the Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen train in revenue service in the Americas, has been recognized on the list of Fast Company World Changing Ideas,” said Michael Keroullé, President Alstom Americas. “This is a testament to green energy innovation happening across the Americas, and to the expertise of suppliers and staff at Alstom who are working every day to bring low-carbon transportation options to communities around the globe.” “I was struck this year by the global sweep of the honorees,” says Fast Company editor-in-chief Brendan Vaughan. “It’s endlessly inspiring to see how the world is coming together to devise inventive solutions to our most challenging problems. We need ideas from everywhere, and this year’s World Changing Ideas Awards are an extraordinary encapsulation of the innovation and creativity that is so abundant around the globe.” President Alstom Americas, said: We congratulate the winner in the Transportation category, as well as other finalists and nominees. We are delighted to have been ranked in the top 5 among such innovative transportation projects. Alstom’s Coradia iLint is the first hydrogen-powered train to carry ticketed passengers in the Americas. It transported over 10,000 passengers in a demonstration project in that ran from mid-June to the end of September 2023. Alstom’s Green Innovation Centre partnered with Train de Charlevoix, Accelera by Cummins, HTEC, Harnois Energies and institutional partners, as well as the Quebec Government and the Hydrogen Research Institute of the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. These partnerships created an agile turnkey operation and ecosystem, enabled to deliver this successful demonstration project. The hydrogen fuel cell-powered train emits only water and can produce its electricity through green hydrogen made from renewable resources. The Coradia iLint enables sustainable train operation while ensuring the highest levels of performance and comfort. Over the span of four months, the Coradia iLint saved 8,400 liters of diesel and averted the emission of 22 tons of CO2 in comparison to the same number of trips made by a diesel train in the UNESCO’s Biosphere Reserve of Charlevoix, where Train de Charlevoix operates. In addition, Alstom and its partners welcomed thirty-four commercial, governmental and regulatory delegations from all over North America to experience this hydrogen-propulsion technology, setting the stage for wider implementation of green transit across North America. The Coradia iLint was also the first hydrogen-powered train in the world in passenger service, and we have now reached 2.8 million km in service in total on hydrogen. Alstom was listed as one of Fast Company’s World’s in March 2024, and the Coradia iLint demonstration project in the Americas also won the Environmental Sustainability Award, and the 2023 from the Canadian Hydrogen Convention.

        "description": "'We haven’t got our luck in All-Ireland finals in the last two years and, look, we’ll perform, we’ll turn up, we always do.'",
        "content": "Offaly under-20 manager Leo O’Connor admits that the heartbreaking defeat in the 2022 minor final is a motivational factor as they face Tipperary again this Saturday. Despite there being eight All-Ireland SFC fixtures this weekend, the All-Ireland under-20 hurling final between Offaly and Tipperary is expected to draw the biggest crowd, with UPMC Nowlan Park’s 26,000 capacity set to be tested. The two counties met in the minor final two years ago, with many of the same players featuring on both sides, as Tipp dramatically snatched victory in the last play of the game through a Paddy McCormack goal. READ MORE: 'They had to dance in the dark up here for a couple of days' Wexford boss Keith Rossiter on pitch after Springsteen concert READ MORE: Wexford take 'consolation prize' as Kilkenny march into another Leinster final It was controversial, however, with the goal coming off a free awarded seconds after Offaly were denied one themselves. “It’s a motivating factor for the lads, no doubt about it, what happened in 2022,” said O’Connor, who was minor manager at the time before taking over the under-20s. “The last puck of the ball, but we’ve all taken our learnings from it and used it as an experience.” Tipp came through the Munster final last Friday night, beating Cork by a point in a thrilling climax, albeit not without controversy again as an umpiring error denied Ben O’Connor’s side a clear goal. “I just think Tipp worked really hard the other night,” said O’Connor, a former Limerick hurler now resident in Newport, Co Tipperary. “They took the opportunities that became available to them. “I suppose it’s like ourselves, they got a bit of luck and when you get the luck, that’s something you’ve to take. “We haven’t got our luck in All-Ireland finals in the last two years and, look, we’ll perform, we’ll turn up, we always do. That’s what this team is a trademark for us. “From that point of view, we’re really happy to be in a good situation where we’re at at the moment.” Offaly lost last year’s under-20 final to Cork, with referee Chris Mooney shipping criticism for his handling of the game but a more experienced whistler has been appointed this time, with Sean Stack, another Dublin official though a native of Clare, handed the task. Speaking before the appointment had been made, O’Connor stressed the need for an experienced referee to take charge of the game. He said: “Our experiences over the last two years, being below in Nowlan Park with a huge crowd, very tight ground, and it creates a very unique atmosphere and certainly, the Offaly support has been absolutely massive and the same below in Thurles last year, a huge Offaly crowd. “One of the things is the experience that senior inter-county referees really have in dealing with that situation so I just think it is very, very important that the right man is put in charge next weekend and with experience, that is able to handle the situation. “There’s too much being put into it for it to be not done properly at this stage.” Although Offaly retained their Leinster title with a three-point win over Dublin in front of more than 15,000 last Wednesday, O’Connor insists that they’ll need to play to a far higher level against Tipp to take the county’s first title at this grade. He added: “We’ve got to improve. All the opportunities that come available to us, we’ve got to take them. “I actually don’t think that we have really played to our full potential and that’s the one thing, the bit of confidence of beating Kilkenny, getting over the line against Dublin the other night, that’s going to be really important going forward.” To keep up to date with all the latest GAA news, sign-up to our GAA newsletter here.",

        "description": "The Czech Constitutional Court has rejected a petition by Indian national Nikhil Gupta detained in prison in Prague against his extradition to the US to face murder for hire charges in ana alleged assassination attempt on Khalistani extremist on American soil. Gupta, 52 was charged by the US federal prosecutors in an indictment unsealed in November 2023, with working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Khalistani extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun who holds dual citizenship in the US. Gupta was arrested in Prague, Czech Republic on June 30, 2023 and is being currently held there. The US government is seeking his extradition to America. The Czech Constitutional Court heard a petition by Gupta against the extradition. The Czech Constitution did not find any circumstances for which the extradition admissible would lead to a violation of any constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms, the court said on May 22, 2024. The court said it ruled that the lower courts had given to aspects that may prevent extradition. It also rejected arguments that the case was political. For the complainant, this brings the proceedings before the Czech courts to an end. The Constitutional Court said it now confirmed the decision of the general courts on the admissibility of the extradition upholding the Municipal Court and the High Court’s order. The court also upheld the local courts decision to reject Gupta’s release request from pre-trial detention and didn’t accept compensation for detention in the form of monetary guarantee or in the form of monetary guarantee or travel abroad. Before, the Constitutional Court the applicant said courts did not examine all the essential circumstances that could become an obstacle to the extradition according to the statement. A Czech High Court in January ruled Gupta can be extradited to the US. A final decision on whether to extradite Gupta will be made by Justice minister Pavel Blazek. The Washington Post, in April 2024, reported that Vikram Yadav an RAW (Research and Analysis) Wing officer was behind the plot. The paper also said that RAW Chef Samant Goel sanctioned the operation. The Indian MEA however, dismissed the report saying that it makes unwarranted claims and unsubstantiated imputations to claim that Indian agents were involved in the plot to kill Pannun. India has publicly said that a high-level inquiry is looking into evidence shared by the US in the alleged plot to kill Pannun.",
        "content": "The Czech Constitutional Court has rejected a petition by Indian national Nikhil Gupta detained in prison in Prague against his extradition to the US to face murder for hire charges in ana alleged assassination attempt on Khalistani extremist on American soil. Gupta, 52 was charged by the US federal prosecutors in an indictment unsealed in November 2023, with working with an Indian government employee in the foiled plot to kill Khalistani extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun who holds dual citizenship in the US. Gupta was arrested in Prague, Czech Republic on June 30, 2023 and is being currently held there. The US government is seeking his extradition to America. The Czech Constitutional Court heard a petition by Gupta against the extradition. The Czech Constitution did not find any circumstances for which the extradition admissible would lead to a violation of any constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms, the court said on May 22, 2024. The court said it ruled that the lower courts had given to aspects that may prevent extradition. It also rejected arguments that the case was political. For the complainant, this brings the proceedings before the Czech courts to an end. The Constitutional Court said it now confirmed the decision of the general courts on the admissibility of the extradition upholding the Municipal Court and the High Court’s order. The court also upheld the local courts decision to reject Gupta’s release request from pre-trial detention and didn’t accept compensation for detention in the form of monetary guarantee or in the form of monetary guarantee or travel abroad. Before, the Constitutional Court the applicant said courts did not examine all the essential circumstances that could become an obstacle to the extradition according to the statement.

        "content": "Berlin considers setting up a over Ukraine, as Vladimir Zelensky has requested, to be a step too far, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Monday. Speaking to the New York Times last week, the Ukrainian leader argued that NATO countries should shoot down Russian missiles from their own territory, just as the US and UK had done with Iranian missiles and drones aimed at Israel. Hebestreit told reporters in Berlin. His comments come two days after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg likewise rejected the notion, telling the German outlet Welt am Sonntag that the US-led bloc Stoltenberg insisted that Instead, the US-led bloc’s chief has proposed agreeing to another of Zelensky’s requests, to lift the supposed restrictions on the use of NATO-provided weapons on what it considers Russian soil. Some of the bloc’s members have already pushed back against the notion, however. Hebestreit dodged the question about whether Kiev had given Berlin assurances that it would not strike Russian territory with German-supplied weapons, saying such arrangements were NATO has also pledged to send Kiev ever more weapons, ammunition and equipment, even as its stockpiles are running dry. Stoltenberg has floated a five-year plan to provide Ukraine with €100 billion ($108 billion) in military aid, but some members of the bloc reportedly have concerns about where the money would come from. Moscow has repeatedly warned that such deliveries would merely prolong the fighting, without changing the outcome, and increase the risk of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",

        "description": "Writer and Dublin resident Bill Barich on what made Laughing in the Hills, the story of a mid-range Californian racetrack, such an enduring classic.",
        "content": "IT WAS LATE afternoon in Northern California and Bill Barich had his waders on to go fishing. For much of the last five years he had dedicated himself, both on bitterly cold mornings and drawn out evenings such as this, to the pursuit of steelhead trout. He didn’t consider himself a particularly good fisherman, but these trout had proven a more evasive target than even he had first cared to imagine. They clung to the river bed, immune to what he had to offer them. Travelling from the Pacific Ocean to this stretch of water to spawn they had no desire to be disturbed by him. Stood on the decking that bordered two sides of the mobile home he rented with his wife on a 14-acre plot, he could see the Russian River below that they had inhabited and he would shortly head toward. All around him was the untouched beauty of Sonoma County and it gladdened Bill’s heart when he looked out from here how much it reminded him of landscapes he had experienced in Italy years earlier. The trailer itself (to call it a mobile home is perhaps too grandiose) was shoddy, but nice. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms and there was a hole in a wall where Bill had flung a boxed manuscript only to discover the fragility of plasterboard. For $200 a month, however, Bill and his wife could overlook any shortcomings. Out there in the countryside, one encountered other people with the same regularity that steelhead trout made themselves known to Bill. This sense of being somewhat removed from the world was welcome. A shared sense of devastation had brought them here. They had lost and were losing close family members to cancer, suffered through miscarriages, and Bill’s wife had undergone what transpired to be unnecessary surgery for a misdiagnosed brain tumor. They had decided that 12 months should be enough to work through what they were feeling, but for the next five years they would call this place home. One cold morning down on the Russian, Bill had encountered (or had been encountered, really) a local who’s knowledge of the steelhead trout far surpassed his own. Had Bill’s struggles not been so apparent, they may have parted company there and then. Instead, he came away with some essential insight to the ways of this fish. If you want to tempt them up, he was told, you would need the roe of a female steelhead, the eggs from her ovaries. And it needed to be fixed to a gold hook he was informed, “otherwise you’re wasting your time”. Fishing had become analogous to writing for Bill. He had left his job in the publishing industry to spend those initial 12 months writing a novel. When one year became two, three and then four, he delivered a novel for each of them. Publishers repeatedly told him that they liked his writing, but something about his fiction just didn’t land. Not to be deterred, he changed his approach. If they liked his writing but not what his imagination had to offer, he would find something else to write about. Something real. As he stood there in his waders about to go fishing, he had figured out how to catch steelhead trout, and his first work of non-fiction had broken through. , a book which recounted his 10-week experience of the 1979 season at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Fields race track would be in book stores soon, and Viking Press had paid him $1,500 for the privilege of publishing it. He hadn’t yet left for the river when the phone started ringing and his wife, who was in the house and answered, called out to him. “Bill, it’s Mr Shawn,” he heard. For almost 30 years William Shawn had been the editor of magazine. Bill’s literary agent had told him that they had been interested in serialising his book, but this was the first conversation he would have with a man who had published everyone from Hannah Arendt to John Updike. In his high-pitched voice and with an unbreakable formality, Mr Shawn spent the next 10 minutes or so explaining how much he had enjoyed to a largely silent Mr Barich. “And we’ll pay you a minimum of $25,000,” the editor said, bringing the conversation to a close and Bill back to his senses. “But my agent told me it was $2,500,” he replied, stunned that the “twenty-five” his agent had been quoted represented an amount unfamiliar to both of them when was concerned. Shawn could only chuckle as this realisation dawned on his newest author and when the phone call ended. Bill, waders still on, decided there was nothing for it but to go fishing. Serialisation in brought Bill Barich’s work immediate and widespread recognition, but it is the book has led both of us to a Dublin hotel café almost half-a-century after its publication. I spend more time than I care to mention (and more money than is wise to count) searching online for old American sports books. It is through this habit that I have encountered David Halberstam’s writing on baseball, Ken Dryden’s remarkable hockey memoir, Frederick Exely’s and most importantly of all, Barich’s s. It had been included on a list Sports Illustrated compiled of the Top 100 Sports Books, and the accompanying blurb seemed at once a touch sensational, but compelling: “Nearing 40 and faced with the death of his mother and a failing marriage, Barich checks into a hotel near Golden Gate Fields racetrack and stays for the season. As he gambles alongside a flock of railbirds, he becomes, he says in this evocative memoir, ‘restored if not renewed.’” As it turned out, he was still a few years shy of 40, it was a motel that he stayed in, and although Barich and his wife would separate it seems presumptuous to describe their marriage as failing based on what we read alone. All the same, I was sold on the premise. The book that followed exceeded all expectations. What I find appeals to me about these old American sports books is their finality. When Halberstam writes about Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio in , I read it knowing that the story has been played out to its fullest. I might find myself hoping things turn out well for some characters over others, but the overwhelming satisfaction of stepping into these sporting stories comes with the certainty that there is no uncertainty. They do not possess the same possibilities for joy and anxiety as actual sport, but the best of those books are not worse off for that. Indeed, they are a welcome escape from that. So far removed in time and place, the measure of their success has less to do with what a team or athlete achieved than how well the writer can tell that story. It was unnerving to then discover that the author of had breached this distinction. For almost 20 years before I had encountered Bill Barich’s work, he had been living in Dublin. In an instant he had ceased to be an abstract figure who had written a brilliant sports book in the late 1970s. It sounds naïve to have never considered that these worlds would interject. Yet, as I watched him walk toward me on a Tuesday morning to a semi-secluded table in the café, it required a conscious leap of logic to associate the man from the book with the Bill Barich now sat opposite me. He is a quietly charming man in his 81st year. There’s little outward trace of the ordeals that he worked through over the course of his book. As he patiently recounts those scenes from decades ago, his memories almost seem to be of an eccentric friend he once knew. Yet, his life changed with the creation of . An aspiring writer who became a published author, the serialisation of the book led to a staff writer job at . Numerous other successful books followed and Barich inched ever further away from the desperate man who had taken his final shot with a book about a mid-range horse track. As he speaks, his attention is drawn to the copy of the book that has been left sitting on the table between us. It is a 2015 reprint that he helped to design himself; the choice of an Edgar Degas painting for the cover was his own, he proudly explains. Degas was only a few years younger painting (‘The Parade’) (1866-68) than Barich had been writing the book. Taking us from the grandstand onto the yellowy grass of the track, Degas shows us six horses and their jockeys in various states of readiness for a race that has yet to begin. The two foregrounded appear stood still. Another two calmly walk in our direction, while the final pair of these jockeys look to be in conversation as their horses move along parallel to one another. This is a seven-horse meet, however, and Degas has instilled a little chaos. The final horse portrayed is closest to the centre of the painting, but it is also the farthest away. The jockey’s clothing – a brownish top and red cap – almost blends in with the autumnal backdrop, but the dark colour of the horse’s coat keeps him in view. Contrary to the calmness of those first six horses, the seventh is panicked and its jockey is desperately trying to bring it back under control. That this wildness is not immediately apparent on first glance feels important. Degas almost allows it to be lost in the beautiful scenery of the Parisian racetrack. Furthermore, it is striking that not one of the other six horses or jockeys appear even to have noticed the struggle that is ongoing. And while Degas’ portrayal of the crowd is vague in that Impressionist style, we can make out enough to realise that there has been no swell of interest on their behalf either. “It was as though many versions of reality were competing for a chance to obtain,” wrote Barich of his initial sensation looking out at the racetrack from the Golden Gate Fields grandstand one hundred years removed from this painting. “I stood there paralyzed, unable to make a choice.” Degas and Barich transmit a shared understanding of the possibilities open to an inquisitive mind at the racetrack. Degas allows himself is a snapshot; one scene in which any number of stories could be told. Barich goes deeper. He brings the horses, their jockeys and the myriad other individuals whose existence interweaves with the track to life. The wildness of Degas’ seventh horse would have been of concern to anyone with money on it. Barich introduces us to these people. There would have been a trainer and groom concerned with why their horse had reacted this way. Barich takes us into their barn. And those people in the crowd whom Degas presents as an anonymous whole, Barich gives them specificity and meaning. The racetrack contains multitudes. Barich unpacks them. Fishing and writing demand patience. So does picking horses. Bill Barich rediscovered the thrill of horse racing throughout the heartbreaking period that his terminally ill mother was slowly taken from him. It started as an occasional wager made at an Off-Track Betting office where his family lived in New York. Soon enough, Bill was driving to the local newsagents every morning to pick up a copy of the Daily Racing Form. Opening it up on the kitchen table, he would lose himself in the details trying to figure out which horses to back. It felt to him that a successful process should be attainable through logic, but could equally be undone through chance. When some family members surprised him by asking to place bets of their own, both the scientific and scattershot methods of picking winners were tested. Once all bets were in, the family would gather together around Bill’s dying mother on the porch and listen to the delayed radio broadcast of the races. “My father said the races were good for her,” he wrote. “I thought [my mother] heard in the track announcer’s call a little pulse of life at the heart of the cancer.” From the kitchen table of his family home in New York to a motel room not far from the Golden Gate Fields racetrack in Albany, California, Bill continued picking horses. He had sold Viking Press on the idea of a non-fiction book and it would involve him spending 10 weeks at a racetrack. There was a part of him that welcomed the time it would offer to really work on his process for picking horses. But there was something greater in the idea that the “little pulse of life” his mother experienced could contain an interior life of its own to be explored. He was not of the horse racing world, nor did he typically frequent racetracks or even know many racing people. When he descended on Golden Gate Fields with the purpose of finding material for a book, it was as a complete unknown. “Joan Didion said about people talking to her because she seems so harmless,” he says, suggesting that his presence was similarly inoffensive to this community of racing people. He refused to carry a notebook for fear that people might consider him a journalist, or worse, a cop. “There’s a lot of things that were going on, particularly at a track like Golden Gate Fields,” he continues, “that people don’t generally want you to know about.” The conversations he had or overheard were only written down in the seclusion of a nearby bar or his motel room. With time, his continual presence at the racetrack inspired more curiosity than suspicion from both the patrons and those working there alike. “You go back to the same barn a fourth time,” he explains, noting that racetracks like Golden Gate Fields didn’t contain owners, trainers and grooms who were commonly sought out for conversations about their work, “they just say, ‘OK, we’ll talk to you.’” What transpired in the form of was an exploration of what goes into the day-to-day running of a racetrack. Using his naivety as an asset, Barich asked simple questions that most readers probably didn’t know the answers to either. There was an unquestionable ordinariness to what he was discovering, but as with the details he pored over looking for clues in a horse’s form, his observations served as an extension of his attempts to finesse the process. To see how a horse is treated when it is not racing, to speak candidly with those working long hours for mediocre pay, or to gain some understanding of the ways horses can be chemically enhanced, it all helps to establish what is in a sense one man’s (ultimately unsuccessful) manual on picking horses. Yet, this sense should not be overplayed. is as much a treatise on gambling as is a guidebook for whaling; some good insights of both are contained within, but it’s scarcely the point. “That book is incredibly compressed, but I wanted it to be like that,” he explains. “I wanted there to be no waste.” It can be therefore difficult to distinguish between the composite parts of and the book in its totality. Structurally, it is broken down into 10 chapters. One for each week he spent at the track, perhaps, although linearity isn’t something that always concerns him. Within each chapter he decided to break things down further into sub-sections; each like a race on a given day’s card. In this sense, it is easy to regard the book as almost a series of Degas’ snapshots from the racetrack. The reader is never asked to focus for too long on one particular subject, and that staccato style can generate the feeling that one’s flying through all the action. However, as with the wild horse that Degas almost allows you to overlook in the background, Barich has an ability to show you worlds within worlds across a matter of paragraphs. His face shows the hint of a smile as I mention the man he encountered in the parking lot of his motel one afternoon. A globe salesman that mistook Bill for a thief, he remembers being briefly overwhelmed by the sight of so many globes in the man’s car when its owner emerged from his room. Inebriated (or working toward it), this guy started raising hell. When Bill explained that he too was a resident of the motel and didn’t mean any harm, the salesman’s anger turned to the deepest guilt. He insisted that Bill accept his offer of a free globe by way of apology. The scene had all the quality of a short story, and Bill’s assessment of the man’s behaviour wonderfully surmised his rapid change of heart: “Minor judgmental errors tend to unhinge men who’ve been drinking alone in motel rooms since two in the afternoon.” Like Degas, Barich can give us just enough information to know what is happening, but only some indication or inference of what might happen next. It is best to approach the question of its totality through the style in which it was written. Barich wasn’t a journalist, but his writing fit within the New Journalism stylings of the era. He insists that this owed more to his work as a novelist than his adherence to any creative credo, but what Tom Wolfe noted in his famed collection of New Journalism works a few years earlier resonated with Barich’s work in the late 1970s: “[Writers of New Journalism] developed the habit of staying with the people they were writing about for days at a time, weeks in some cases. They had to gather all the material the conventional journalist was after – and then keep going. It seemed all important to when dramatic scenes took place, to get the dialogue, the gestures, the facial expressions, the details of the environment. The idea was to give the full objective description, plus something that readers had always had to go to novels and short stories for: namely, the subjective or emotional life of the characters. That was why it was so ironic when both the journalistic and literary old guards began to attack this new journalism as ‘impressionistic’. The most important things one attempted in terms of technique depended upon a depth of information that had never been demanded in newspaper work.” As was the case for certain prominent purveyors of this style, Barich assumes the role of the book’s central character around which all events take place. However, unlike Hunter S Thompson or Wolfe himself, Barich’s presence is not overwhelming. Indeed, Barich’s reader is afforded a dual role as the audience for which he is writing, but also as a player in the process of acquiring the information that will come to be written about. Whatever rules New Journalism broke in turn of reporting and technique, the material that could be unearthed (and the unearthing of that material) was of primary importance. What Wolfe described as “the juice”. To the extent then that tells a story from Golden Gate Fields, Bill’s discovery of Pichi shaped the narrative course of the book. She was an unruly horse brought to Gary Headley’s stable. What Degas left to the imagination, Barich brings to life. Pichi’s concerned owners turned to Headley and his captivating groom, Bo Twinn in the hope that they could salvage the genealogical pedigree this wild horse possessed and turn it into a winner. In a book that never really intends to tug at sentimentality, it almost worried Barich when he succumbed to the pull of Pichi and this traditional underdog story. When people speak to him now about the book, it is Pichi that they almost inevitably mention. And he has learned to be at ease with that for it remains a remarkable story. “God know what Gary Headley gave her,” he says with a laugh, “but it worked!” There is another aspect of that unsettles its categorisation as a sports book. Too prominent to have been overlooked by the blurb-writer at , it can only have been a choice to not include it. Bill Barich spends a considerable portion of this book writing about Florence during the Renaissance. When he considers that decision now, there is no doubt in his mind that it was correct. “Well, I thought I may never write another book,” he says, “so I figured I’d put everything I know into this one.” Some readers had trouble reading of a mid-range Californian racetrack one moment, before being asked to consider the author’s portrayal of 15th and 16th century Florentine artists the next. I would argue that this facet of Barich’s creativity is what turns from a very good sports book into an exceptional one. Weaving both worlds together when he locates a suitable point of intersection, he is as comfortable dedicating standalone sections of the book to some aspect of Florence’s rich history. They are both remarkably compelling and open-minded. Barich continually invites the reader to become an interpreter. Through some act of serendipity, I had encountered – knowing nothing of it beyond what the blurb detailed – not too long after visiting Florence for the first time. “I chose to live in... the legendary Florence of Lorenzo the Magnificent,” he wrote in a chapter dedicated to the months he spent living there as an exchange student in the 1960s. My visit only lasted a few days, but his intention rang true. Florence, with its remarkable artwork and history, encourage such duality of thought. You walk through the city as it stands today, constantly aware of those who walked before you. It reveals itself to you as you project your own thoughts upon it. just took that all out,” he says, all references to Florence removed from the two-magazine run it was published across. “That was brutal.” While his experience publishing the book with Viking was arduous in the way one might expect, presented an altogether tougher challenge. It would be unfair to suggest that he was misled, but Shawn’s lavish praise for had given Barich cause to assume that there would only be so much that needed changing. “You have to debate everything,” he says, “from commas to semi-colons.” And then there were the fact-checkers. A necessary process, Barich nevertheless found himself answering questions about how a particular trainer might take to being described as “flakey” (“He’s a racetrack guy, he’s been called worse, believe me!”) and that it’s generally considered better not to describe someone as bald if it can be avoided at all (“It’s deeply offensive, apparently”). On and on, with manuscripts being sent back and forth between their offices in New York City and Bill’s home in the Californian countryside, it severely tested his patience. “I wasn’t about to roll over though,” he says. “I was very happy to be taken seriously.” When it was eventually published across two magazines in April and May 1980, the effect it had on his personal and professional life was transformative. “It actually ended up being around $35,000,” he says, an even greater amount than he had been able to contemplate when he first got the call from Shawn. With that enormous payday, Bill and his wife departed their trailer overlooking the river on a 14-acre plot of land in Sonoma County for a house in the suburbs (that didn’t last long). The following year he would have four articles in and by 1982 he even had two pieces of his fictional writing published there too. More books would shortly follow. His writing eventually featured in collections like and , and in recent years he has even worked as a screenwriter for the HBO show, . He had always regarded as something of a last shot at making it, unaware then of whatever that entailed and where it could take him. As we prepare to leave the café, I realise that I haven’t really asked Bill how he ended up living in Dublin. The great contradiction of is how he took an enormous risk in the real life sense while remaining quite a cautious gambler. “Of my initial five hundred dollars,” he wrote in the book’s closing chapter, the set amount he allowed himself from his first day at Golden Gate Fields, “I had three hundred sixty-four dollars left.” It’s always been this way with him, he explains. Like Degas looking at the racetrack from afar, there is some of that wild horse in Bill Barich looking back out at us from within. He has no issue hedging everything on an impulse of the heart. Holidaying in London he met an Irish woman named Imelda, fell in love and decided to act on it. “I had friends who thought I was being rash or just plain foolish,” he later wrote, “but trust and conviction grow if real love is in the mix.” We depart the building and walk a short distance until our paths are set to diverge. He is heading down Anthony Cronin Walk and we briefly discuss , Cronin’s memoir of life in literary Dublin. “I met him once,” Bill says, “I heard he liked horses.”",

Every day, in communities across Western Canada, Black Press Media ’s award-winning journalists are telling stories that matter, sharing the information you need to make thoughtful, informed decisions. Whether they’re taking a deep dive into the need for accessible addictions treatment in your community, holding local politicians accountable for municipal spending or showcasing the tireless efforts of local volunteers, journalists matter. In fact, community news journalists are, more often than not, telling the stories that affect you most directly. These are the stories that hit close to home – the ones about the campaign for a new park, efforts to improve traffic through your neighbourhood or about the blossoming new artist performing at your local theatre. At the same time, they also bring the local impact of world events into focus – the refugees arriving from war-torn Ukraine, for example, or the volunteers aiding overseas rescue efforts following an earthquake in Japan. Imagine a world without local, professional journalism But pause for a minute and consider a world without community journalists... Who would be sharing the impartial analysis of the controversial council decision? Who would ask the questions that need to be asked, then have the training and expertise to present the answers fairly, in a meaningful way. Black Press Media’s 180 community journalists – more than any other news media organization operating in Western Canada – hail from Canada’s top journalism schools, giving readers confidence in the accuracy and authenticity of the stories they’re sharing.

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "In a world where AI and social media make it increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction, trusted local journalism matters more than ever. Every day, in communities across Western Canada, ’s award-winning journalists are telling stories that matter, sharing the information you need to make thoughtful, informed decisions. Whether they’re taking a deep dive into the need for accessible addictions treatment in your community, holding local politicians accountable for municipal spending or showcasing the tireless efforts of local volunteers, journalists matter. In fact, community news journalists are, more often than not, telling the stories that affect you most directly. These are the stories that hit close to home – the ones about the campaign for a new park, efforts to improve traffic through your neighbourhood or about the blossoming new artist performing at your local theatre. At the same time, they also bring the local impact of world events into focus – the refugees arriving from war-torn Ukraine, for example, or the volunteers aiding overseas rescue efforts following an earthquake in Japan. But pause for a minute and consider a world without community journalists... Who would be sharing the impartial analysis of the controversial council decision? Who would ask the questions that need to be asked, then have the training and expertise to present the answers fairly, in a meaningful way. Black Press Media’s 180 community journalists – more than any other news media organization operating in Western Canada – hail from Canada’s top journalism schools, giving readers confidence in the accuracy and authenticity of the stories they’re sharing. Today, in more than 70 communities in Western Canada, Black Press Media is your window to what’s happening in your neighbourhood, your city, your province and beyond, with stories told by experienced, accountable journalists who uphold standards of truth, transparency and fairness. A world without that is unimaginable.",

The bloc wants to ditch Russian natural gas ideally by 2027, but it will not have weaned off all natural gas by that date, so it could hit the suppliers on which it would depend the most for gas later this decade. “With Europe importing a large part of the fossil energy it consumes, the regulation will also help to reduce methane emissions from imported fossil fuels,” the European Commission said today after the Council adopted the rules. “The regulation will progressively introduce more stringent requirements to ensure that exporters gradually apply the same monitoring, reporting and verification obligations as EU operators,” the Commission added. “To meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, we must cut methane emissions in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. This legislation ensures proper monitoring and addressing of emissions across these value chains,” said Tinne Van der Straeten, the Energy Minister of Belgium, which holds the EU rotating presidency in the first half of the year. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The European Commission for Energy, Kadri Simson, said, “With the final EU adoption of the methane regulation we now have means to get clearer insight into the main sources of methane emissions in the energy sector. This will increase transparency and provide the tools necessary to reduce these potent emissions, both in the EU and globally.” The Commission will review the application of the regulation in 2028, including the level of emissions reduction achieved.

        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.”",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.",

        "content": "In a world where AI and social media make it increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction, trusted local journalism matters more than ever. Every day, in communities across Western Canada, ’s award-winning journalists are telling stories that matter, sharing the information you need to make thoughtful, informed decisions. Whether they’re taking a deep dive into the need for accessible addictions treatment in your community, holding local politicians accountable for municipal spending or showcasing the tireless efforts of local volunteers, journalists matter. In fact, community news journalists are, more often than not, telling the stories that affect you most directly. These are the stories that hit close to home – the ones about the campaign for a new park, efforts to improve traffic through your neighbourhood or about the blossoming new artist performing at your local theatre. At the same time, they also bring the local impact of world events into focus – the refugees arriving from war-torn Ukraine, for example, or the volunteers aiding overseas rescue efforts following an earthquake in Japan. But pause for a minute and consider a world without community journalists... Who would be sharing the impartial analysis of the controversial council decision? Who would ask the questions that need to be asked, then have the training and expertise to present the answers fairly, in a meaningful way. Black Press Media’s 180 community journalists – more than any other news media organization operating in Western Canada – hail from Canada’s top journalism schools, giving readers confidence in the accuracy and authenticity of the stories they’re sharing. Today, in more than 70 communities in Western Canada, Black Press Media is your window to what’s happening in your neighbourhood, your city, your province and beyond, with stories told by experienced, accountable journalists who uphold standards of truth, transparency and fairness. A world without that is unimaginable.",

        "description": "While the pendulum seems to have swung to the ‘life’ side, some wonder if it has gone too far.",
        "content": "Does anyone want to work anymore? Since 2020, we’ve endured a stream of supposed work trends. “Quiet quitting” is among the most prominent. According to TikTok, it’s when you “ .” Gallup recently that “‘quiet quitters’ make up at least 50 per cent of the U.S. workforce — probably more.” Canada is purportedly , with two-thirds of workers quiet quitting. Quiet quitting supposedly reflects a new age of anti-ambition, where “decentering” work is celebrated. As Simone Stolzoff proclaims in his recent book , work-life balance needs a recalibration. “Go for good enough” is now inspirational advice. The message: Work less — and care less about it. While the pendulum seems to have swung to the “life” side, some wonder if it has gone too far. Is work ethic fading? To find out, we partnered with the research firm YouGov to conduct a survey of 5,000 Americans in November of 2023. We then partnered with research firm Angus Reid to replicate that same survey with 2,500 Canadians in May of 2024. We call our study the MESSI ( ). Directly measuring work ethic is challenging. As one indicator, we asked respondents: “How much effort do you put into your job beyond what is required?” If work ethic is waning, most people should answer “none.” But that wasn’t the case — not even close. Even more striking is that the numbers are similar for American and Canadian full-time workers. In both surveys, roughly 52 per cent said “a lot,” 35 per cent said “some,” 10 per cent said “a little,” and a mere 3 per cent said “none.” Has work ethic changed over time? To check, we excavated data from the classic and found Americans were similar to our 2023 MESSI. In 1977, 57 per cent said “a lot,” 36 per cent said “some,” 5 per cent said “a little” and 2 per cent said “none” when asked the same question. As much as things change about the organization and culture of work, the average worker’s willingness to go above and beyond has barely budged. But how can we explain the disconnect between all the these days and workers’ responses about their own work ethic? To find out, in both MESSI surveys we asked: “How much effort do you think the ‘average [American/Canadian] worker’ puts into their job beyond what is required?” In a surprise to likely no one, most people think they work harder than others. While 52 per cent of American and Canadian workers say they personally put a lot of effort into their job beyond what is required, only 13 per cent of all workers believe that the average American or Canadian worker does the same. So, to answer the question about if anyone wants to work anymore, the simple answer is yes. But there is a major disconnect between how hard we say we work and how hard we think others work. We really got a sense of the bad vibes — how lousy it is “out there,” for everyone else — when we asked workers about work ethic. Here’s just a sampling of what people told us. A caterer declared that people “in general these days hate their jobs and don’t want to work at all.” A janitor lamented: “Not many people want to work, and if they do, most of them complain about their work or other people they work with.” And a locksmith added: “Most people are just not interested in working more than they have to.” “I feel attitudes have changed a lot,” a cook explained. “People used to work hard to get their jobs done and were happy with their paycheque. Now a lot of people don’t care, choose when they feel like working, and complain a lot.” A CEO of a roofing company amplified the point: “In an era of rampant poor work ethic, chronic victimhood mentality and the worst combination of self-entitlement with intense envy of what is perceived that everyone else has, most people are unnecessarily miserable at their jobs.” Despite what most Americans and Canadians think, most workers say they are still willing to go above and beyond. On balance, that’s a good thing. Working hard is anchoring for our and motivation. A 67-year-old custodian told us: “Most people, if truthful, don’t work for the money; rather, people derive their satisfaction from the things that come from steady work — pride, personal responsibility, satisfaction and the ability to determine what they want to achieve or accomplish.” The residual aftershocks of the and the so-called have sullied work’s reputation. We believe that a perception-reality check about the state of work ethic is needed to correct the prevalence inflation that sustains the pessimism. Cutting into those bad vibes would be a small step toward repairing work’s damaged reputation.",

        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Aubrey the two-year-old cockapoo is looking for his forever home. He has been living in the care of the RSPCA since he was removed from a property by one of their inspectors with his sister. Staff at the Suffolk Central branch in Martlesham have said Aubrey has not had the best start in life and can be very worried by lots of new things, including new people, traffic and sounds. His future family will need to be able to visit the centre regularly to spend time with him, so that he can build a relationship and learn to trust them before being taken home. Staff are also looking for adopters who will continue his positive training and socialising once in the home, with the support of the behaviour team. He loves spending time with his carers, getting lots of affection and playing with his favourite toys, whilst zooming around the enclosed field. He's got lots of energy and love to give to the right home who can build his confidence in the world at his pace. His ideal home would be in a rural area with few visitors and access to walks away from busy traffic and lots of people.",

        "content": "That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Tickets Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars.

The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.”",

        "content": "A group calling for lower rates in Dunedin has been told rates affordability needs to be balanced with the increasing costs of delivering core services. The Reduce Rates Group said it asked Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich and city councillors a series of questions. One was whether the council had \"any understanding of the real hardship out there for many of our community\". \"There are many elderly and lower-income citizens who struggle from day to day to make ends meet\", the group said. \"Rate increases are another huge burden and worry for them.\" A council response was not written by the mayor. It came from council staff. \"The council recognises that rates need to be at an affordable level overall, and that it needs to balance affordability with increasing costs of delivering core services\", an unidentified staff member said. \"Residents on low incomes will continue to be encouraged to access the rates rebate scheme offered by central government as a means of offsetting the cost of rates.\" The council has proposed a rates increase of 17.5% and signalled a rise in debt of about $118 million in the next year. Asked about debt levels, the council staff member said this was due to the capital programme the council was delivering, largely in dealing with water, waste and roading. The group agreed on a series of resolutions at a public meeting last month. They included asking the council to recognise a high level of concern about the proposed rates increase and debt levels. The group suggested cutting back, postponing or cancelling non-essential and \"enhancement\" works and that the council look into staffing levels and contractor and consultant performance. \"Please note also that many of us voted for you due to concerns about over-spending by the previous council\", the group told elected representatives during annual plan submissions. The council is deliberating on submissions this week. grant.miller@odt.co.nz",

        "content": "In most cases, and her co-creators are uncomfortable talking about the success of the heartfelt Midwestern dramedy. But when it comes to winning the Peabody Award, they’re putting the humility aside. “I’m telling everybody that will listen that we won a Peabody,” says Everett. “I’m not normally like this, but we fly sort of under the radar. I’m so proud of this show, and I want more people to see it — if an award gets that done, then even better.” Here, Everett and showrunners Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen took a break from editing season three and spoke to about the show’s trajectory. Honestly, it feels like a family. We had a lot of people that came back. Paul and Hannah do a great job of keeping everybody uplifted and feeling great, and I just feel like we have a better idea of what the show is now. There were so many beautiful moments that I’m really excited about. There were a lot of tears and laughter, and we got to be present and really enjoy a lot of the moments. Even though we worked really fast, we still got to have a little bit more time in a few areas. It was also different — a bit nicer — to be shooting in 30-degree Chicago weather versus the 100-degree Chicago weather we had in previous seasons. Because of the strikes, our schedules shifted. But I will say that Bridget, everyone on set loves her, and she’s the best swag- and gift-giver. I thought that it felt instantaneous when we did the pilot. We had Mike Haggerty there, and being around him feels like you’re getting a big hug all the time. He did a lot to remind us to be grateful. We obviously miss him very much. And since nobody on this show is a big star (laughs), we’re all like, can you fucking believe this? I still feel that way, by the way. And this was a lot of people’s first job like this. Our First AD, who is the best First AD I’ve ever had, he would always say, we are so lucky to be here. It was not lost on any of us that we’re getting this opportunity for the first time in our 40s and 50s. No! But I’ll say that HBO is such a great creative partner. We’d written all the scripts for season three before the strike, in anticipation of hopefully getting the green light, and then we got it right at the beginning of the strike. And they’ve always been so encouraging. But I think every season, until we’re sitting in front of our TVs and see the HBO logo, we don’t believe it’s real. I think that just comes from a lifetime of disappointments. I hold on to enough negativity in my life. We had the opportunity to move forward and to give all these people jobs. So there was a lot of gratitude. And we have Amy Gravitt, our executive, who has been a cheerleader for us the whole. So I was excited to get back to work with Amy. We were one of the first shows to be back — as soon as we were told we were allowed to, we started preparing to shoot. The winter timing also gives season three a different feel, and I’m excited to show that tone of the Midwest. That’s got to be the shit scene. When we did that, I was like oh my God we’re going to lose a lot of people with this. But it made us laugh, and it made [producer] Carolyn Strauss laugh — every time she sees that scene she just cackles, and she’s been in the biz for awhile. We tried some new things and people came along for the ride and that was incredibly gratifying because I was scared. For me, it’s the evolution of grief. Mike Haggerty was very present in that season and we wanted to make something that was worthy of him. For me it’s probably social media, with comments and messages. I know that social media can be such a toilet, but it can also be helpful to understand if you’ve gotten it right. There was also Bridget Everett Day in Manhattan, KS last year. I grew up in a rural town in Minnesota and seeing how people from our hometowns respond to the show is really important. I was in Manhattan, KS and we were out at Old Chicago — it was the only place we could get a table that night — and at different points somebody who runs queer studies at Kansas State and the head basketball coach came over to tell me they liked the show. I found it very satisfying that people from such different walks of life could see themselves in the show and respond well to it. You don’t want your hometown to turn on you and think you’re a big turkey. I think you articulated that whole situation the way we would. We all feel that way. We love this place, but there’s a reason we leave. Working on this show has helped us find the beauty of where we’re from without ignoring the challenges of the place. Being in the edit really taught us about the tone of the show. Carolyn has said this show exists in the cracks, and we learned how to let the show breathe. And there’s this thing that happens, where the actors are still at the end of a scene, and the scene is stopped, but we use a lot of that footage. We also have learned to make it look and sound less like a TV show and more like its own special thing. There are story beats in season one that we felt like we needed to do because it was a TV show, and we would end up cutting them. So then in season two we just didn’t write those things. I’m telling everybody that will listen that we won a Peabody. Because we fly sort of under the radar. I’m so proud of this show and I’m so proud we’re being recognized this way. I’m not normally like this, but I do want people to know. And I want more people to see the show, and if the Peabody gets that done, even better. If not, it’s just something that I can stare at. I know exactly where I’m going to put it, so that I can remind myself we got this one right. I have ‘Poppy’s Garden’ on my coffee table, which is a little shrine to my dog who died. So I’m going to put it right by the shrine. There would be no Somebody, Somewhere without Poppy. I’m number one on the call sheet, and you need that person to be able to engage emotionally — she opened me up. She gave me that ability. So there you go. .

        "content": "Sally Craik, pictured at the Vauxhall Yacht Club yesterday, will play at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington for the 80th anniversary of D- Day. PHOTO: LINDA ROBERTSON Sally Craik will pipe the international tune The Battles O’er at Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington on June 6, leading the 80th anniversary of D-Day’s worldwide commemorations. Ms Craik said she had been preparing for this event for nearly a year. She had previously performed at Larnach Castle for the Queen. \"I have had to practise several hours every week\", she said. \"The tune we are playing is very traditional; the emotions that come from the sound of the bagpipes is really beautiful.\" \"It’s going to be exciting leading the call.\" On June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched the largest amphibious invasion in history, known as Operation Overlord or D-Day. This monumental offensive on the beaches of Normandy marked a turning point in World War 2, paving the way for the eventual liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation. Ms Craik said she was humbled to be able to pay tribute to its history. \"The bagpipes have such a resonant sound; this is a real opportunity for them to be heard. \"I'm quite nervous and excited; it’s also an opportunity to pay tribute to my Scottish heritage.\" As night descends over the Allied nations, the sound of bagpipes will be played in the capital cities on June 6 at 9.10pm, starting in Wellington and then on to Canberra, London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Washington DC, Ottawa, Paris, Brussels, Athens, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo, Warsaw and Prague, and Normandy. Pageant master of D-Day 80 Bruno Peek said the tune had particular significance to the day. \"There were countless acts of bravery that day, one of that stands out was 21-year-old Piper Bill Millin, 1st Special Service Brigade and Personal Piper to Lord Lovat, who came ashore armed with only his bagpipes to play under fire on Sword Beach as his comrades came ashore.\" matthew.littlewood@odt.co.nz",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Associated Press Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Associated Press Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! What is a Momcation? A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Dunedin artist Shane Legg uses the Sun to create art on wood at the Dunedin Railway Station yesterday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Dunedin artist Shane Legg has been \"painting\" wood art with a magnifying glass for nearly a decade. He has perfected the process over the years, to the point where he could make the magnifying glass paintings \"dance with the light\". \"I call it solar pyrography ... it’s something I learned when I lived up in sunny Twizel. \"I've always been able to draw, but the compelling part for me is the fact I can create something without ever touching the wood.\" He uses a magnifying glass to magnify the light and create a parabola effect, effectively \"drawing with the light\". \"I can paint anything on the wood, but I particularly like painting birds and mountains\", he said. \"I enjoy painting architecture; I like the straight lines of buildings. I also get a lot of commissions for dogs.\" The art required a certain amount of sunlight to be effective, he said. \"I've been a bit unlucky with Dunedin over the past couple of weeks. There hasn't been enough light for my pictures. \"There’s something natural about the finished result, the burning of the wood. \"It’s as quick as a marker pen— and it’s all about angles. \"As the Sun moves, I angle the hand. I don't get shaky hands; I'm pretty fluid — once I've got the wood burning, just the slightest feather of movement creates a wisp.\" The effect was similar to that of a \"human laser\". He advised people to wear protective eyewear, sunblock and have patience to find time to get the right light. \"It’s not that hard to do. If you have the ability to draw and the patience to find the tiny light, then it’s very effective. It’s just such a special way of drawing\", Mr Legg said.",

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "content": "A Southland rugby family picked up an extra player 10 days ago, leading to an unexpected double celebratory double. Wyndham prop Brad Shaw said plans were neatly in place for his club of 20 years to mark his 200th game — against old rivals Edendale — when wife Dana went into labour with their third child on May 18. Wyndham rugby player Brad Shaw and baby Marlee fly the flag shortly after her birth at Southland Hospital, before Shaw's 200th game. PHOTOS: SUPPLIED Fortunately — about 2.30am — there were a few hours before he was scheduled to run out to the sound of bagpipes played by son Jack, 8, but Mr Shaw said he gave the midwife a hurry-along nonetheless. \"We’d had about two hours’ sleep when contractions started, so we headed to Southland Hospital and got Dana comfy. \"I told our midwife she had till lunchtime to get the baby out, because we were all off to the rugby at that point.\" In the event, daughter Marlee was born at 8.49am, allowing the family to spend some time together before heading pitch-side for the day’s second celebration. Mrs Shaw said, despite being tempted to sneak along for the special match, she remained in a warm place with baby Marlee. \"I’d had my other two [children, Quinn, 7, and Jack] early as well, so it was kind of expected Marlee might come along early. \"But when I started getting contractions overnight Friday, it was a case of ‘here we go’.\" Brad and Dana Shaw with Marlee. \"We’re all extremely proud of his dedication to the club he loves. \"He started there in 2004 aged 18, and he’s embraced every part of Wyndham RFC. He’s been away for a couple of spells at Eastern Hawks and playing overseas in Holland and Germany, but Wyndham has always been where our family’s heart lies.\" Mr Shaw said it had been a special moment to be piped on to the pitch by his son. \"Once the birth had all gone smoothly, it kind of made me a bit more relaxed about everything. \"To have the wee fellah playing the bagpipes for my 200th game, I can tell you there was a tear not just in my eye, but a few of the players’. That definitely got to a few of us. Jack Shaw pipes his dad on to the field in Brad Shaw’s 200th game for the Wyndham club. Mr Shaw said the match was drawn 20-20, making it a day of doubles all round. Although it was too early to tell where baby Marlee’s talents might lie, Mr Shaw was not immune to being a little superstitious. \"Maybe rugby will be her game. We’ll have to see.\"",

        "description": "Gary Kircher. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Waitaki Mayor Gary Kircher has called a government move to tamper with Māori wards inconsistent and unfair.",
        "content": "Gary Kircher. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Mr Kircher and 51 other mayors and chairmen signed a letter last week to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other ministers. The government is set to introduce legislation in the coming months to restore the ability for communities to petition their councils to hold binding polls on Māori ward decisions. This will include holding binding polls on wards that were established without local referendums being able to take place. Mr Kircher said the government never consulted with councils on the issues and running polls would cost a \"signficant\" amount. \"If they’d come and ask us then they would know the answer is no.\" Māori wards and constituencies are designed to allow Māori to contribute to decision-making and have representation at council. They are voted for on the Māori electoral roll. Candidates do not need to be of mana whenua descent, or Māori. Mr Kircher said Waitaki did not have 10% of its voters on the Māori roll, which meant it would need to increase the number of councillors to facilitate a Māori ward. The council already had 10 councillors, which was high considering the population and it already worked closely with mana whenua. Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu and Te Rūnanga o Moeraki chairman Justin Tipa said they had put a lot of time and effort into their relationship with the council across many different kaupapa (policies). Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu had not made any formal statements for or against the legislation. \"Our view is that the Treaty relationship as it relates to local government is between local government authorities and mana whenua. \"It is completely fair for mayors like Gary to speak out when they feel that central government is interfering with their ability to manage their relationships with tangata whenua themselves\", Mr Tipa said. Mr Kircher said the government was overreaching. \"It’s about bringing consistency into it.\" The bill was defended by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who said the \"true democratic process\" would be restored. Mr Kircher said he wondered why Mr Peters did not support the need for a poll for other changes in council issues, such as councillor numbers, ward changes or the creation or abolition of community boards. \"If central government seriously want to give local democracy, then make the polls a requirement for all points or even better make it a requirement for some of the things they do.\" Stuff reported that Local Government Minister Simeon Brown responded to the letter, saying he disagreed with the mayors’ and chairpersons’ assertions. He said the coalition government believed communities should determine whether to introduce Māori wards. \"This government believes in localism and in letting local people decide their constitutional arrangements\", he said.",

        "content": "Dame Lois Muir is presented her Netball New Zealand service award by Silver Ferns Georgia (left) and Kate Heffernan at Dunedin Netball’s celebration of the NNZ centenary at the weekend. PHOTO: DUNEDIN NETBALL The people who are the first to arrive and the last to leave, the ones who give up hours to run the scoreboards, pick up the whistle, offer words of wisdom and everything in between. Dunedin Netball celebrated all those people at a special function on Saturday when the organisation also marked Netball New Zealand becoming the first national netball body to reach 100 years. It was a chance to pay tribute for everyone's invaluable service — some spanning more than 50 years — and also acknowledge the past, present and the future of the sport. Former Otago team photos, uniforms and books were on display. From players, coaches, umpires, support staff, bench officials and more, 27 people from across Otago were recognised with NNZ service awards, including four NNZ life members. Otago coaching great Lois Muir, who was inducted into NNZ hall of fame with icon status earlier this year, was at the top of that list and gladly accepted her award and those of fellow Otago NNZ life members the late Sara Foster, Rena Mackenzie and Margaret McAughtrie. Silver Fern and Southern Steel sisters Kate and Georgia Heffernan — whose mother, Annette, was coached by Muir for the Silver Ferns in the 1980s — presented the awards at the function at the Edgar Centre, adding to a full circle moment for the family. There were special presentations on Sunday for Georgie Salter after the Southern Steel’s win in Dunedin — where they won the Georgina Salter Memorial Trophy — which her family accepted, and for Steel assistant coach Jo Morrison. Dunedin Netball general manager Lee-Anne Anderson said there were many special and emotional moments throughout the event. \"Very special, particularly when Dame Lois is able to come out and celebrate with us\", Anderson said. \"For her to make the effort and to come down and be with us that’s always really special. \"But I think particularly so, there was a number of family members that had received the certificates on behalf of their family members that had passed that was really emotional. \"It was really special seeing them being able accept acknowledgement on behalf of their family members that had done so much for Otago. \"Some of those women never had children so netball was their life and some of those people that did have families ... netball was so much a part of their life it’s almost like they did more with netball than they did sometimes their families.\" Netball New Zealand Honour roll Otago life members: Lois Muir, Sara Foster*, Rena Mackenzie*, Margaret McAughtrie*.

        "content": "Highlander winger Jona Nareki gets past Fiji Drua Flanker Etonia Waqa to score during Sunday’s game at Forsyth Barr Stadium. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH After crushing the Fijian Drua 39-3 at Forsyth Barr Stadium on Sunday, the Highlanders have booked themselves a spot in the Super Rugby Pacific playoffs. The Highlanders, who sit seventh with six wins, were solid across the park. Assistant coach Dave Dillon was pleased with his side’s defensive effort in keeping the Drua to just three points. \"Always nice when the other team doesn’t score a try, but just looking as the game was unfolding and that, there was a couple of handling errors and that from them, they made a few line breaks\", Dillon said. \"The bounce of the ball was definitely on our side.\" The Highlanders scored some sparkling tries through their back three as well as a late intercept to replacement No 8 Nikora Broughton. \"[Assistant coaches] Kenny Lynn and Tom Donnelly work pretty close on that side of the ball, so it was good to see some of their work that they’d strategically plotted to come to fruition.\" Winger Jona Nareki was a cut above in his first game back after nursing a hamstring complaint and bagged two tries for his side. \"He’s had some bad luck with injury Choc\", Dillon said. \"He has real value on and off the field. To get him back on and see what he can do, I thought he was class.\" Right winger Timoci Tavatavanawai was also sublime and helped himself to a blockbusting try. But his work over the ball and coming up with jackal turnovers might be his greatest weapon. \"As a defensive coach, to have a winger that has that awareness and strength over the ball it’s almost like a super power\", Dillon said. The Highlanders head to Wellington this weekend to play the Hurricanes, who will be buoyed by their 20-17 win against the Chiefs in their final round-robin game. The Highlanders will need to ramp things up after they were well beaten 47-12 when they played the Hurricanes back in round six. \"We’ve got to continue to build. Obviously they’re up around the top of the table for a reason. \"This season we played them down here and it was probably one of our poorest performances. We’re looking forward to getting up there and rolling up our sleeves and getting into it.\"",

        "content": "Kate Heffernan (left) drives on to the ball from her sister, Georgia, during the Southern Steel’s game against the Northern Mystics in Dunedin on Sunday. PHOTOS: MICHAEL BRADLEY PHOTOGRAPHY Rightly so — the Southern Steel coach had just led her team to their first victory against the Northern Mystics since April 17, 2022. They did it in emphatic fashion with a 47-43 victory over the ANZ Premiership defending champions at the Edgar Centre on Sunday to win the Georgina Salter Memorial Trophy. \"I actually feel amazing,\" Bloxham told the Otago Daily Times after the game. \"There’s been times where we let ourselves down, but ... I really felt like we took control of that game right from the start. \"I feel immensely proud of us being able to bring the trophy back here and hold on to it.\" Defensively, it was the best performance of the season for the Steel who recorded 14 gains, 12 deflections, seven intercepts and three defensive rebounds. Then there is the collective effort they showed to grind the Mystics into mistakes that do not show up on the statistics sheet. \"I’m super proud of the defensive effort that we put out there. \"It just gives them confidence in some of the things that we’ve been talking about. \"The girls really did their homework really well this week and we were really specific about what we wanted to target. \"I think that’s really pleasing as a coach when you can see that out there in real time ... and them pulling it off.\" Southern Steel coach Reinga Bloxham. A dreaded injury curse remains with the Steel after Shannon Saunders was ruled out for the season and replacement wing attack Ivari Christie was ruled out of Sunday’s game with a knee complaint. Bloxham called up Serina Daunakamakama, who is a Mystics training partner and plays for New Zealand under-21, and after only being at two trainings, and a captain’s run, she was impressive at wing attack. She caught the eye of Bloxham, who said Daunakamakama did an \"amazing job\", as did the other attackers \"You can’t underestimate somebody like Georgia and Kate Heffernan, and even Grace [Namana],\" Bloxham said. \"They really did their job so well that [Daunakamakama] could just focus on what she needed to do.\" Bloxham spoke during the week about other players needing to step up into senior roles without the calm presence of Saunders, and Bloxham was pleased to see the rise of Georgia Heffernan. \"Georgia works really hard and she does a power of work for us, but I think ... as the game went out, you could really see her really settle into her job and really understand that she was going to have to lead down there. \"That’s great for us going forward if she can continue to do that.\" The Steel will need to build from that performance when they face the Central Pulse, who will be hurting after their first loss at the weekend, in Invercargill on Saturday. kayla.hodge@odt.co.nz",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” RELATED: Former B.C. premier Horgan helps sell Canadian hydrogen in Germany RELATED: B.C. eyes green hydrogen economy with cross-country partnership RELATED: Opposition worried gov is pressuring hydrogen company over PG proposal RELATED: Canada’s first renewable diesel and hydrogen complex to open in Prince George Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. RELATED: Infrastructure bank lends $75M to BC Ferries for zero-emission vessels Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.

        "description": "The art in Kendall Jenner's LA home is the perfect choice for her space – experts weigh in on decorating with art the right way",
        "content": "Kendall Jenner's stylish white living room is anything but boring. Though neutrals feature heavily in the socialite's space, she uses varied materials to add visual interest to the room. Jenner's is awash with a mix of materials. The dark floors are upholstered in a soft white rug. Boucle chairs and a sofa surround a marble coffee table. On the wall, wooden painted panels create a gorgeous, naturally inspired contrast to the modernity of the space. This piece of art grounds and centers the space. Art experts laud how Kendall has decorated her . Katherine Earnhardt, Founder of Mason Lane Art Advisory states: ' selected a piece that certainly highlights the height in the space and nods to the organic surrounding design elements. More importantly though, if Kendall connects with the piece - its materiality, structure, story, and the characters shown in it, then that makes it perfectly suited for this intimate social area of her living room.' A photo posted by amykchin on Furthermore, the choice of a wooden piece particularly compliments Kendall's . 'Wood has a softer look and feel that creates a warm, welcoming energy, which is particularly appealing in the home,' Earnhardt says. She continues, 'Many artists who work with wood also consider the story of the wood and how it can be repurposed. This fuels their artistic practice and informs how and what they create. Earnhardt is the Founder of Mason Lane Art Advisory Services with offices across the US and Canada. With nearly 20 years of experience in the art world, Katharine has an in-depth knowledge of art, business, and entrepreneurship. She has worked at the Museum of Modern Art, Christie’s Inc, and Gurr Johns, conducting extensive research on art value and investment. Katharine has a dual degree in Art History and Economics from Williams College and a Master's in Art Business from Sotheby’s Institute of Art. can be difficult, but following the guidance laid out by Kendall's space makes it much easier. Earnhardt tells : 'Select artwork that connects with you on a personal level. Instead of considering whether you love it or hate it, consider whether it's interesting to you. This exercise enables you to develop a greater awareness for what makes you tick. If you acquire works aligned with that understanding, you'll end up with meaningful pieces that speak to you in the long term.' Glen Hardwick-Bruce, expert at Art world advisory group adds: 'When choosing art for a living room, it's important to consider the overall aesthetic and function of the space.' He continues, 'Choose artwork that complements the existing decor style. For example, a modern living room might benefit from contemporary art, while a traditional space might suit classic paintings or prints. Take measurements of the wall space where the art will be displayed and choose pieces that fit well proportionally. Oversized artwork can make a bold statement, while smaller pieces can be grouped together for visual interest.' Glen founded Art World Advisory Group where he offers bespoke education, curated tours, and advisory services. Before starting his own venture, he was the Director of Continuing Education at Christie's Education for 12 Years. He has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Archaeology and Communications and a Master’s degree in Ancient Art and Architecture. He concludes, 'Ultimately, choose artwork that speaks to you personally. Whether it's a favorite artist, a meaningful subject, or simply a piece that brings you joy, selecting art that you love will enhance your enjoyment of the living room.' Design expertise in your inbox – from inspiring decorating ideas and beautiful celebrity homes to practical gardening advice and shopping round-ups. Unique, personalized pieces are what makes Kendall Jenner's living room feel so comforting and cozy. Vintage pieces that incorporate natural materials will lend a similar feel. This sleek, antique-style ottoman is made of solid wood and stylish black velvet. The solid color and solid wood is a perfect addition to any eclectic living room. This dark stained acacia and flower marble coffee table is glamorous in its sleek white, greay , and deep amber coloring. Designed by Mermelada Estudio. This Scandinavian design vase has a warm and natural look. It is made of gray and brown terracotta with purposeful distressing. Kendall Jenner's space is more evidence that decorating to the beat of your own drummer can never be a bad thing. When you choose decor that you love, the effects can be amazing.",

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.”",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "WASHINGTON: Josef Newgarden of Team Penske denied a late challenge from Mexican Pato O’Ward to win a thrilling and incident packed Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, becoming the first back-to-back winner in 22 years. New Zealand’s Scott Dixon finished third in the race which had been delayed by four hours due to heavy rain and lightning in the area. The crowd were rewarded for their patience during the storm delay with a dramatic finale to the race. O’Ward, whose best finish in the race was runner-up in 2022, looked to have timed his push perfectly, grabbing the lead in turn one on the final lap. But Newgarden powered back to pass him going into turn three and claim a record-extending 20th victory in the Indy 500 for Penske. Newgarden finished 0.341 ahead of Arrow McLaren’s O’Ward and celebrated by jumping into the crowd. “There is no better way to win a race than that. I’ve got to give it up to Pato as well,” Newgarden told race broadcasters NBC. “He’s an incredibly clean driver. He could have easily won this race, too, but it just fell our way and I am so proud of everybody, proud of the whole team,” he said. The last driver to win back-to-back in the fabled race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was Brazilian Helio Castroneves, who triumphed in 2001 and 2002. So close O’Ward was distraught after again getting so close to the prize he has sought for so long. “It’s hard to put it in words. I’m proud of the work that we did today. We recovered. we went back, we went forward, we went back,” he said. “Some people were just driving like maniacs. We had so many near race enders and just so close again, so close,” he said. “I put that car through things I never thought he was going to be able to do. Oh man, it’s just so painful when you put so much into it and then two laps short, or two corners short,” he added. Alexander Rossi of Arrow McLaren, had jousted with Newgarden for the lead but finished fourth with Spaniard Alex Palou of Chip Ganassi Racing in fifth. Penske’s Scott McLaughlin, who started on pole, finished sixth. The lead changed 87-times over the 500 miles with 16 different race leaders. The opening lap was a chaotic one when British rookie Tom Blomqvist caused a crash on the opening lap that collected 2022 winner Marcus Ericsson of Sweden and Brazilian Pietro Fittipaldi. Blomqvist lost control after touching the curbing and span across the track colliding with Andretti Global’s Ericsson. “I can’t believe it,” said Ericsson after completing a medical check. “It’s unbelievable. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know what to say. We had to work so hard. We fought all last weekend. We fought all week and this happens,” he said. Penske redemption Marco Andretti failed to finish after his car made wall contact as he was approaching O’Ward on turn one of lap 114 after a restart following a yellow flag. “I don’t really trust half the guys I’m around, but you’ve just got to go for it and whatever happens, happens,” said Andretti. The victory for Newgarden was a sweet moment for Penske who have endured criticism and sanctions after a cheating scandal. Team president Tim Cindric, race engineer Luke Mason and two others were suspended for two races including the Indy 500. The suspension came after IndyCar uncovered a set-up on three Penske cars at Long Beach last month allowing drivers to utilize a “push-to-pass” button on starts and restarts in violation of series rules. Newgarden was stripped of his win in St. Petersburg, Florida, in the season opener and he didn’t miss the chance to respond to the critics. “They can say whatever they want at this point, I don’t care anymore,” said the Tennessean. “I’m just so proud of the team, they crushed it. They came in with the fastest cars and we’ve worked our tails off,” he added. “Luke, Tim, they are not here today but they are a huge part of this,” he added. — AFP",

        "content": "Readers searching for treasures at The Star Regent 24 Hour Book sale. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Angela Trolove will take what she can get of Italian literature in Ōtepoti Dunedin. A few years ago, I would travel from Tainui each week to bring my son to Opoho playcentre, a place I really liked. There I met a mother who grew up in Brighton. She was pleased her childhood friends were just neighbours, she said. You couldn’t choose your subculture in the back of beyond. It was your neighbours or no-one. I admire that. In this way, and this is the real point of this article, while in German or French you’re spoilt for choice, second-hand Italian books in Ōtepoti Dunedin are finite. When I do luck in at the Regent book sale, I can count on one hand my donor’s interests: mathematical theory and, for children, Richard Scarry. So I pay my gold coin to the voluntary cashier and take home a book on Infinity. A little light evening reading. A modest collection of novels at the public library veers more towards literature. This collection was donated by my Italian teacher who convenes the community’s La Piccola Italia. In it, there are some excellent short stories by the good-hearted yet precise Antonio Tabbuchi and formal, humane Primo Levi. But looking for novelty, I tip the spine down on a thick Mondadori paperback. I’ll take what I can get. All this to say I’m working my way through a novel outside my genre by an author I don’t warm to and this in my expensive downtime. I put him down. I pick him up. Fabio Volo’s novel Un Posto Nel Mondo boldly bores where no book has bored before. Three paragraphs indulge narrator Michele debating how to word a first text to love interest Francesca. As Michele’s insecurity accrues, I blurt aloud \"Are you joking?\" I check through the novel for an editor to whom I can say, \"Mud be on your name\", but there is none. Harsh criticism on my part. While there are dull tracts in this popular fiction novel (often a feeling of word-count-for-the-sake-of-word-count surfaces), I snuggle into any writer, in this case TV presenter Fabio Volo, diligently writing a book. Even when that book includes a blow-by-blow of frustrations and mental prattle as narrator Michele agonises for Francesca to message him back. Diligence. Good. Does criticism also exist to stop writers abusing readers? But, snarls the devil, you can put the book down at any time. I am not his readership. A lot of toilet talk. I search online for reviews for the book. The first-up glow. One allows, of Volo’s novels perhaps this is the lesser work. I am allowed to read the book, I tell myself. It was in bookstores in 2006 and reprinted three times by 2010, according to my copy. It’s there on the library shelf, but I also feel like I’m not allowed to read it because Volo is not my people. If I grew up in Brighton, he would be my people by necessity. I read on to maintain my language so I can be with my children in their father’s Lombardy when we return there. I love the Italian language. With Tabucchi I look up the high words. With Volo I could look up the slang but I won’t need them to fit in with the people I want to. Call me a snob. And yet he is coherent and diligent as a writer, and he loves peeing standing, and loving women. I tautoko that. I recognise and celebrate that. His chapter breaks make sense. Credit where credit is due. He knows how to saddle up the horse-and-trap of a novel and flap the reins and make it go. On the plus side, here’s what popular fiction does — \"not all popular fiction\" — allowing clichés, it dares me to lighten up. Popular fiction gives me a sense of humour. It releases me from perfectionism. In an often wealthy country like Aotearoa New Zealand, it’s an anomaly, almost delectable, being limited for choice. The books available to me have this curious denominator of readers of Italian who spent time in my city. My Italian canon is at the mercy of their tastes. I could read e-books. I could ask my mother-in-law (a connoisseur of literature) to post me winners of the Premio Strega. I listen to podcasts and audio books on RAI (Radio Italia). But I enjoy in autumn attending the annual Regent book sale. This year, I stock up on the three Italian volumes to get me through a long, cold winter. Like a Belgian writer friend once told me, our happiness is out of our hands. We’re granted finite happiness in life and it comes to us when it comes. It’s not something we determine. And I brightened. My Italian literary input is like that. — Angela Trolove is a poet who teaches creative writing at the University of Otago.",

        "content": "Philippa Laufiso, of Dunedin, with Governor-General Dame Cindy Kiro, after being presented with the MNZM for services to arts and the community earlier this month. PHOTO: GOVERNMENT HOUSE Ahead of next week’s King’s Birthday honours list, Cabinet minister Louise Upston writes about the importance of recognising people. It was 140 years ago that New Zealand honoured its first woman, Miss Annie Alice Crisp, Lady Superintendent of Auckland Hospital, with the Royal Red Cross on April 19, 1884. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross in a ceremony at Government House in Auckland, attended by more than 600 people. Established the previous year by Queen Victoria to recognise \"special devotion and competency ... in their nursing duties with our Army in the field, or in our naval and military hospitals\", the decoration was conferred exclusively on women until 1976. Crisp had served with distinction in the Zulu and Anglo-Egyptian Wars and been awarded the Egyptian medal and the Khedive’s Star. Annie was clearly an exceptional woman. Since then, we have seen more and more women be nominated for their unwavering contribution to their communities. However, I believe there are more hidden gems out there waiting to be recognised for their commitment to the country. Nominations for the New Year Honours list should be submitted to the Honours Unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet before mid-June. As acting Minister for Women, and Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, I am always in awe learning about the incredible people that serve New Zealand. We have an abundance of talent, work ethic and compassion that makes our country great, and the honours system is a fantastic opportunity to bring this to light. Twice a year honours lists celebrating extraordinary New Zealanders and their achievements are announced, and in the last five years we have seen women recipients account for around half of those lists. It’s a nod to the key role women play across our communities and in the fabric of our society. As our honours system has evolved, what we have seen in recent years is a real increase in the recognition of people doing extraordinary things across our local community, charity, and voluntary sectors. About 800 to 1000 nominations are considered each year, and it is a great opportunity to celebrate all the wonderful New Zealanders from all over the country who are serving their communities and achieving something special. Without nominations received from the public, many of our backroom heroes — the people who go into their communities, get involved with organisations and charities, and give back to other people — wouldn’t be celebrated in the way they deserve. This year’s list of New Year Honours recipients, for example, recognised 74 women out of 151 recipients. In addition to highlighting the work of women in services to sport, education, the arts, health, and business, it also highlighted the work some women have done supporting other women, including in governance, helping survivors of domestic violence, and addressing the gender pay gap. We probably all know someone who has been exceptional and made a positive impact in their community. Let’s shine some light their way and celebrate them. By increasing the number of individuals nominated for these awards, not only do we recognise their efforts, but we can also improve the diversity of the awards, particularly when it comes to gender representation, and ensure that they reflect New Zealand communities. — Louise Upston is the Minister of Community and Voluntary Sector, Disability Issues, Social Development and Child Poverty Reduction.",

        "description": "Ploughing-in rushes with a motor tractor. — Otago Witness, 27.5.1924 The farm school course of instruction was continued yesterday.",
        "content": "Ploughing-in rushes with a motor tractor. — Otago Witness, 27.5.1924 Mr G. Holford BAg gave an interesting address on farm tractors. He stated that one of the most striking features in connection with arable farming in the dominion was undoubtedly the demand for farm tractors. An investigation had shown that circumstances had arisen which made farmers turn their attention to tractors for farm work. It had to be said that the tractor would never really displace all the horses on a farm. There were certain tasks that were more suitable to the horse, and for this reason the retention of a number of them was considered essential. The speaker gave reasons why the tractor was bound eventually to take the place of the horse in heavy farm work. A tractor worked in any weather. A horse was subject to ills of the flesh, and the tractor was machinery which any man of average intelligence and ability could fix in a short time. The expenses for horses went on the whole time, whereas when the switch was turned off on the tractor it was finished with until again required. Tractors enabled the farmer to work a large area of land in a short time, and so he could take advantage of the limited period when the soil had to be used to the best advantage. The speaker quoted the relative cost of the tractor and a two-horse team for one year’s working. It had been proved that a two-horse team cost £1000 to work for one year, while on the other hand it cost only £600 to work the tractor. Columnist moved by messages In Memoriam verses are not always conceived in the most felicitous taste, though they are pathetically well-intentioned, and therefore exempt from criticism. An unhappy example one would never think of quoting, but I was struck by the juxtaposition of two maternal notices of last Saturday ( ODT , May 24, 1924): \"Moe mai E Mama, Ito moenga roa, I runga Moeraki, Moke moke ai. Mate Ariki Koe manaki ai, Moe mai E Mama, Ito moenga roa.\" \"The noblest thoughts my soul can claim, The holiest words my tongue can frame, Unworthy are to praise the name, More sacred than all other. An infant, when her first love came, A man, to find it just the same; Reverently I breathe her name, The blessed name of mother.\" — by ‘Wayfarer’ Rails extend inland A correspondent writing from Beaumont states that the Public Works Department is making good headway with the railway line. They are now within three miles of Miller’s Flat, but it will be some considerable time before the last touches are put on and the line opened. Window’s crash launches apples The truth of the old adage \"It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good\" was borne out on Monday evening, when a large front window in the premises of Mr A. Geddes, fruiterer, Princes street, fell outwards, and the fine display of Delicious apples which the window contained was precipitated upon the footpath. Small boys and also a number of their elders \"made hay while the sun shone\" and about 12 or 14 cases of apples wore promptly collected by the onlookers. The window was valued at approximately £25 and was covered by insurance. It is surmised that the heavy wind, combined with the weight of the apples, caused the window to collapse. — ODT , 28.5.1924 ( Compiled by Peter Dowden )",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure.

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” RELATED: Former B.C. premier Horgan helps sell Canadian hydrogen in Germany RELATED: B.C. eyes green hydrogen economy with cross-country partnership RELATED: Opposition worried gov is pressuring hydrogen company over PG proposal RELATED: Canada’s first renewable diesel and hydrogen complex to open in Prince George Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. RELATED: Infrastructure bank lends $75M to BC Ferries for zero-emission vessels Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.",

He has been living in the care of the RSPCA since he was removed from a property by one of their inspectors with his sister. Staff at the Suffolk Central branch in Martlesham have said Aubrey has not had the best start in life and can be very worried by lots of new things, including new people, traffic and sounds. His future family will need to be able to visit the centre regularly to spend time with him, so that he can build a relationship and learn to trust them before being taken home. Staff are also looking for adopters who will continue his positive training and socialising once in the home, with the support of the behaviour team. He loves spending time with his carers, getting lots of affection and playing with his favourite toys, whilst zooming around the enclosed field. He's got lots of energy and love to give to the right home who can build his confidence in the world at his pace. His ideal home would be in a rural area with few visitors and access to walks away from busy traffic and lots of people.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "North Korea has reportedly fired a rocket believed to be its second military spy satellite just hours after its plan was met with criticism from neighbouring countries. According to South Korea's joint chiefs of staff, the suspected spy satellite was launched from North Korea's primary space facility in the northeast at 10.44pm local time on Monday (May 27), following a trajectory that suggests espionage capabilities. In a statement, the joint chiefs detailed that the North Korean projectile was fired southwards from the peninsula's west coast and that, shortly after launch, multiple fragments were observed falling into the sea, prompting further analysis by South Korean and US intelligence to determine the success of the mission. READ MORE: 'Final nail in the coffin' as popular Manchester restaurant announces shock closure after five years Earlier that day, North Korea had informed Japan's coast guard of its intention to send \"a satellite rocket\" into space sometime between Monday and June 3. Following the launch, Japanese authorities rescinded a missile alert for Okinawa, having assessed that the missile posed no threat to the region. Last November, North Korea claimed to have successfully orbited its inaugural military reconnaissance satellite, aiming to establish a space-based monitoring system amid what it perceives as escalating military challenges led by the United States. Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader, subsequently announced at a party meeting the plan to deploy three more military spy satellites by 2024, as part of the country's expanding surveillance efforts. This latest launch comes after two previous attempts that failed to reach orbit. In the initial attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite plunged into the ocean shortly after take-off. The North Korean authorities attributed this to a loss of thrust following the separation of the rocket's first and second stages. Following the second attempt, North Korea reported an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The UN prohibits North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, interpreting them as a guise for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has consistently asserted its right to launch satellites and test missiles. Mr Kim has stated that spy satellites will enable his military to more effectively monitor US and South Korean military activities, thereby enhancing the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles.

Especially when it's camels that are gridlocked. But camel traffic jams are exactly what take place amid the dunes of Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring Scenic Spot in China. The problem became so acute that local authorities dreamt up a unique, world-first solution to stop delayed tourists from getting the hump (as Brits sometimes describe becoming annoyed) - camel traffic lights. The unique system was installed in 2021 at the popular spot on the outskirts of Dunhuang City in northwest China 's Gansu province. Camel traffic lights have been installed at Mingsha Mountain and Crescent Spring Scenic Spot The unique system was installed in 2021 at the popular spot on the outskirts of Dunhuang City in northwest China's Gansu province The signals serve the same purpose as regular traffic lights and display the same traditional green pedestrian symbols on one side. But on the other side, they show a distinctive image of a two-humped camel. Dozens of traffic lights were installed along the scenic route to allow pedestrians to cross in between long lines of camels. The signals serve the same purpose as regular traffic lights. They display the traditional green pedestrian symbols on one side, but an image of a two-humped camel on the other The unique system at Mingsha Mountain (above) has itself become a tourist attraction Read More I'm a wildlife expert and my commute is taking two steps into a rainforest. This is what it's like living in a jungle and why I love it (despite the venomous centipedes and cobras) When the green camel light is on, camels can pass, and when the red camel light is on, camels stop to let pedestrians through. While the traffic lights have worked to speed up camel rides through the desert, it hasn't made the area any less busy - the traffic lights have become a popular tourist attraction in themselves. According to China Daily , Wang Youxia, deputy general manager of the company responsible for the scenic spot's operations said that more than 3.7million tourists visited last year, with 42 per cent of those opting for camel rides. The scenic area is home to around 2,000 camels, each transporting multiple tourists a day, according to the website. The camel rides are operated by local villagers, who charge around 100 yuan (£12/$14) per tourist for an hour-long camel trek.

        "content": "A woman stabbed to death on a beach in the seaside town of Bournemouth has been named locally as Amie Gray, a sports coach who has been described as a beloved mother, wife and friend. A 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of her murder has been released without charge, Dorset police have said, adding that they were stepping up their hunt for the killer. On Monday they released CCTV images of a suspect and warned members of the public not to approach him. Officers combed the beach and the surrounding areas as holidaymakers sunbathed nearby. Family and friends paid tribute to Gray, 34, from Poole, who was the women’s head coach at Dorset futsal club. Some scattered petals on to the sea at Durley Chine beach as the sun went down on Sunday and posted on social media: “Sunsets will always remind us of you, Amie Gray. Forever loved wife and mother.” Gray and a second woman, 38, were stabbed at 11.45pm on Friday. The second woman was seriously injured and is still being treated in hospital. Police renewed their appeal to identify the suspect from CCTV images. The force said: “A 17-year-old boy from Lancashire was arrested on suspicion of murder. Following inquiries over the weekend, he has now been released without charge and eliminated from inquiries.” Det Supt Richard Dixey, of the major crime investigation team, said: “The investigation into this tragic incident is progressing and detectives are dedicated to finding out what happened and ensuring our communities remain safe and secure. “We need the public’s help to identify the suspect in the CCTV images. If you recognise him or have any information, no matter how small, that may lead us to his identity, please get in touch immediately. We would ask the public not to approach a suspect under any circumstances, but to call 999 immediately. “Officers and staff from across the force are out in the town conducting extensive inquiries, including house-to-house visits, so the public will see a very overt and planned police presence in and around the Bournemouth area. “We do not take lightly the impact this tragic incident will have on our communities and many members of the public will be concerned. There remains an enhanced and visible policing presence in the area with officers who can be approached if the public feel in any way concerned.” A friend of Gray posted on social media: “She was always the kindest lovely young girl and continued to be so throughout her cruelly cut short life.” Another said: “Fly high, Amie Gray, I’ll miss you so much. I feel so heavy! You were such a good friend and someone I could call about anything. A beautiful person inside and out. Thank you for all the laughs and memories I will cherish for ever.” A third added: “You lit up the room with your fun and bubbly presence.” Floral tributes have been left at both ends of the mile-long cordon. Officers with metal detectors and sniffer dogs have been seen combing the beach and clambering up the cliffs. Dorset futsal club posted on its Facebook page: “The club has received some truly devastating news. We cannot put this into words at this time and as a mark of respect to all those affected, we will not be posting anything new for the foreseeable future.” Residents spoke of their concerns at the incident and at crime in general in the area. One, who did not want to be named, said: “There’s definitely been a noticeable increase in antisocial behaviour and crime in Bournemouth in the last few years. It’s alarming.” A couple who rent a beach hut and wanted to remain anonymous said: “We are definitely worried by this incident, but we wouldn’t walk around the beach late at night anyway.”",

The net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 2024 registered multi-fold increase at Rs 1016 crore against Rs.522 crore which is about 95percent higher as compared to the year-ago period. Worth mentioning that despite weak prices of metals, market volatility and geopolitical crosswinds, NALCO has been able to register considerable growth in several fronts and in profit margins in FY24. The Company has been able to continue its growth trajectory supported by robust growth across all its business units. In FY24, the company achieved highest-ever bauxite excavation of 76,00,230 metric tonnes, highest-ever Cast Metal production of 4,63,428 metric tonnes, highest-ever metal sale of 4,70,108 metric tonnes and production of 2 million tonnes of coal in the very first year of operationalization of its Coal Mines.
