        "content": "WhatsApp , the globally recognized messaging app, is reportedly working on a new facility that will enable users to personalize their chat themes and accent colors. This feature is currently being fine-tuned in the WhatsApp beta for iOS 24.11.10.70 version. It will provide users with the option to customize their chat bubble colors as well as wallpapers, moving away from the company's traditional green theme that has been a constant since its inception. Four additional chat themes coming to WhatsApp According to a report from WABetaInfo , WhatsApp plans to introduce four additional chat theme options in an upcoming update. This new feature was discovered during the TestFlight beta program and is currently under development. Users will be able to choose from five themes - the default green, as well as blue, gray, red, and purple. The selection of a new chat theme will automatically adjust the user's wallpaper and bubble color, to align with the chosen theme's color palette. WhatsApp to enable accent color customization In addition to chat themes, WhatsApp is also developing a facility that will allow iOS users to modify the app's accent color. This customization will impact the look of in-app buttons and will be restricted to the same color choices as the chat themes. Another feature spotted in a recent beta update for Android version 2.24.11.17 is an AI image generator for profile pictures, which creates personalized images based on user-provided text prompts.",

        "content": "Astronomers have made a groundbreaking discovery, finding strong evidence of a vast ocean of liquid water hidden beneath the icy surface of Pluto. The research, published in the scientific journal Icarus , offers new insights into the composition of this distant celestial body. The study was led by Alex Nguyen, a graduate student in Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. Unraveling Pluto's subsurface ocean using NASA's images Nguyen's team employed mathematical models and images from NASA 's New Horizons spacecraft to investigate Pluto's subsurface ocean. The study, co-authored by Patrick McGovern of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, sheds light on a long-standing debate about the existence of liquid water on Pluto. This research marks a significant step forward in understanding the dwarf planet's composition. Pluto's hidden ocean: A closer look Nguyen and McGovern further explored the properties of Pluto's hidden ocean. They created mathematical models to explain the cracks and bulges in the ice covering the Sputnik Platina Basin. This massive basin, formed by a meteor impact billions of years ago, suggests an ocean below. Their models indicate this ocean is shielded by a 40-to-80-kilometer-thick shell of water ice. Estimating the density of Pluto's hidden ocean By analyzing surface fractures, the researchers were able to estimate the ocean's potential density or salinity. According to Nguyen, they determined a zone similar to Goldilocks, where the density and shell thickness find an optimal equilibrium. The findings suggest that Pluto's ocean is about 8% denser than Earth's seawater, comparable to Utah's Great Salt Lake. If humans could somehow reach Pluto's ocean, they would effortlessly float. Facts about Pluto Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially hailed as the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet. Pluto traverses its orbit around the Sun at an average distance of 5.9 billion kilometers, requiring roughly 248 Earth years to complete a single revolution. Measuring approximately 2,372 kilometers in diameter, it is smaller than Earth's moon.",

        "content": "West Indies and USA will co-host the 2024 edition of the ICC T20 World Cup . The ninth edition of the global tournament will get underway on June 1. 20 teams will feature in the competition. Meanwhile, England will enter as defending champions, having tasted glory in 2022. Here we present the notable records from the 2022 edition, which took place in Australia. Kohli becomes the highest run-getter in T20 WC history Indian ace Virat Kohli displaced Mahela Jayawardene (1,016) as the highest run-scorer in T20 WC history. The former now has 1,141 runs in 27 games at an average of 81.50. Kohli also became the first batter to score 250+ runs in a T20 WC edition thrice (2014, 2016, and 2022). The tournament also saw Kohli become the first player to complete 4,000 T20I runs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan's stellar partnership record During the New Zealand vs Pakistan semi-final, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan became the first pair to record three century partnerships in T20 WCs. While the duo added 105 runs against the Black Caps, they recorded scores of 152* and 113 against India and Namibia in 2021, respectively. Their tally of 636 runs is also the highest for any pair in the tournament's history. Two hat-tricks in the tournament UAE's Karthik Meiyappan became the first associate-team bowler to scalp a hat-trick in T20 WC, against Sri Lanka. Ireland pacer Joshua Little was the other bowler with a hat-trick in the tournament, against NZ. Little's feat made Ireland the only team to have two bowlers with T20 WC hat-tricks. Curtis Campher took four wickets off as many balls against Netherlands in 2021. Player of the Tournament - Sam Curran England's Sam Curran was named both the Player of the Match in the final and the Player of the Tournament. He recorded 3/12 against Pakistan in the summit clash. Overall, the left-arm pacer finished as the joint-second-highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets in six games. Curran, who conceded runs at 6.41, was the only bowler to claim a five-fer in the tournament, 5/10 vs Afghanistan﻿. Most runs - Virat Kohli Kohli finished the tournament as the highest run-scorer, having scored 296 runs. While his average was just under 100, he struck at 136.41 in the competition. Kohli's tally of four fifties was also the highest in the competition. Netherlands' Max O'Dowd (242), India's Suryakumar Yadav (239), England's Jos Buttler (225), and Sri Lanka 's Kusal Mendis (223) were the others with 220-plus runs. Most wickets - Wanindu Hasaranga Wanindu Hasaranga once again finished the tournament as the highest wicket-taker, having scalped 15 wickets in eight games. While the Sri Lankan leg-spinner conceded runs at a paltry rate of 6.41, his strike rate was 12.4. Curran and Netherlands's Bas de Leede were the joint-second-highest wicket-takers with 13 scalps apiece. Zimbabwe's Blessing Muzarabani is next on the list with 12 scalps. Here are the other notable records Kohli became the first player to score 300 runs against a team in T20 WC, 308 vs Pakistan. Rohit Sharma became the most capped player in T20 WC, having played 39 games. Ireland's Campher became the first all-rounder with a fifty and hat-trick in T20 WCs. Scotaland's Michael Jones recorded the highest score by an Associate player in T20 WCs, 86 versus Ireland. Two centurions in the competition SA's Rilee Rossouw was the first centurion of the competition. He mustered 109 off 56 balls against Bangladesh. The only other century that year came from NZ's Glenn Phillips 's blade. He made 104 off 64 balls against SL. Meanwhile, SA's 205/5 against Bangladesh was the highest team total that year. NZ were the only other side to touch the 200-run mark, 200/3 versus Australia.",

He reiterated, \"We take security seriously and that's why we end-to-end encrypt your messages. They don't get sent to us every night or exported to us.\" Cathcart clarifies WhatsApp's stance on user data backup Cathcart further clarified WhatsApp's policy regarding user data, particularly message backups. He stated that if users wish to backup their messages, they can use their cloud provider and even apply end-to-end encryption for the same. The ongoing public feud between Musk and Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) has been a topic of discussion since Musk took over X in 2022. Musk reignites cage fight challenge amid Meta rivalry The rivalry between Musk and Meta has been escalating, especially after the launch of Meta's Threads app, which directly competes with X. The tension heightened when Musk challenged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, a proposition that Zuckerberg dismissed as not serious. Recently, however, Musk reignited the cage fight talks on X by stating, \"I'm ready to fight Zuck anywhere, anytime with any rules. LFG!!!\"",

        "content": "The film Hamare Baarah , starring Annu Kapoor , Ashwini Kalsekar, Manoj Joshi , and Parth Samthaan among others, has stirred controversy due to its provocative teasers. The movie's depiction of a specific religion has been met with disapproval from a section of society, allegedly resulting in death threats against the team. In response to these threats, veteran actor Kapoor released a video message urging viewers to watch the film before forming their opinions. Why does this story matter? Initially titled Hum Do Humare Baraah , the film was renamed following a directive from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The drama was first announced in 2022, and since then, it has created an uproar online for its alleged Islamophobia. Makers, including director Kamal Chandra, have claimed that the movie doesn't target any one community but highlights \"the most important and crucial problem of our country,\" population explosion. 'The film advocates women's empowerment...' Kapoor addressed the threats in a video message, emphasizing their seriousness and calling for police protection for the film team. He urged viewers to watch the film before lambasting it, stating, \"The film advocates women's empowerment and talks about the rights of women. First, watch the film and then give your verdict.\" Kapoor clarified that the movie's intention was not to offend any caste or community but to discuss women's empowerment and population boom. Kapoor urges audiences to reserve judgment, engage with story Kapoor revealed people were giving death threats on social media and via calls. \"Please don't abuse, don't give us threats because we are not afraid. I request Maharashtra Police and the Home Ministry to perform their duty and provide protection to every member of the team who's getting death threats. The seasoned actor concluded his message by saying, \"If you try to disrupt the peace, then we will also not sit silently.\" Hamare Baarah will be released on June 7.

        "content": "Fashion and art have long been intertwined, reflecting the cultural zeitgeist and individual creativity. This article explores how to translate iconic art movements into everyday wear, offering a fresh perspective on personal style. By understanding the essence of each movement, you can curate outfits that are not only stylish but also carry a deeper artistic significance. Impressionism in apparel To embody the essence of Impressionism in your wardrobe, choose garments in soft pastels and incorporate lightweight fabrics that feature dappled prints.

Aim to replicate the movement's delicate brushstrokes and nuanced play of light through your clothing selections, embracing the artistry in everyday fashion. Cubist couture To channel Cubism's essence in your wardrobe, select structured garments that feature bold, angular patterns. A jacket with pronounced shoulders or accessories adorned with cube or pyramid motifs can reflect Cubist influences. Additionally, combining different textures in your outfit can mimic the collage techniques prominent in Cubism, offering a modern twist on this art movement's distinctive style. Surrealist statements Surrealism's dream-like quality translates into whimsical accessories and unexpected combinations in fashion. Incorporate Salvador Dali-inspired elements, like melting clocks on a handbag or shoes adorned with optical illusions. This approach adds a surprising element to your outfit, sparking conversations. It's about embracing the surrealists' vision by integrating the extraordinary into everyday wear, making each piece a statement of artistic expression and individuality. Pop art popularity Embrace Pop Art's essence with vibrant colors and bold graphics. Opt for attire featuring comic prints or iconic pop culture imagery, like a Warhol-esque T-shirt. When paired with solid-colored pants, this combination becomes an eye-catching ensemble that pays homage to Pop Art's explosive movement. This approach brings the dynamic visual style of Pop Art into everyday fashion, celebrating this iconic art movement. Minimalist mode For those drawn to Minimalism, focus on monochromatic outfits, clean lines, and simple silhouettes. Quality over quantity is crucial; invest in well-crafted basics that last. This approach reflects the minimalist art movement's emphasis on simplicity and longevity. By choosing pieces that embody these principles, you create a wardrobe that mirrors the timeless elegance of minimalist art.",

        "description": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania, is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.",
        "content": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania , is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin . This rare album was secretly recorded between 2006 and 2013 and was previously owned by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli. It is now on loan from digital art collective Pleasr for Mona's upcoming exhibition Namedropping , which explores status, celebrity, and notoriety. Know more about the group Established in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan stands as a legendary American hip-hop collective. Comprising iconic figures like RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa, alongside the late Ol' Dirty Bastard until 2004, they reshaped the landscape of East Coast hip-hop. Renowned for their influence and innovation, Wu-Tang Clan is hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. What makes the album unique? Often referred to as the \"most valuable ever made due to its rarity,\" the album features contributions from all surviving members of the Wu-Tang Clan group and includes two appearances from songstress Cher. It is housed in an ornate silver box and was intended as a statement about the impact of streaming and piracy on the value of music. Producers Cilvaringz and RZA described it as \"400-year-old Renaissance-style approach to music\"—aiming to inspire urgent debates about the future of music. Album cannot be used for commercial purposes until 2103 A single two-CD copy of the album was pressed in 2015, with all digital master files subsequently \"deleted.\" A unique legal agreement stipulates that the album cannot be used for any commercial purpose until 2103 or 88 years after its creation. RZA explained that this number was chosen because there were eight original Wu-Tang Clan members—the numbers of the year 2015 added up to eight, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity. Album's journey from Shkreli to Pleasr and Mona Museum In 2015, a 13-minute medley of the album was played at New York's MoMa to about 150 art experts, rap fans, and prospective buyers. Shkreli later attempted to sell the album on eBay where bidding reached $1.2M—but failed to complete a sale. After his conviction for securities fraud in 2018, Shkreli was forced to surrender the album along with other assets totaling $7.4M. In 2021, Pleasr acquired it from the US Department of Justice for $4M to cover Shkreli's debts. Public debut of Wu-Tang Clan's album at Mona Museum Mona will hold free ticketed listening sessions from June 15-24 where attendees can hear a curated 30-minute mix of the album played from a personalized Wu-Tang PlayStation 1 inside Mona's recording studio, Frying Pan. This marks the first time that this unique album has been loaned to a museum since its original sale. \" Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is more than just an album, so... I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\" said Mona director.",

        "content": "Kaftans, celebrated for their flowing elegance and comfort, have crossed borders to become a global fashion staple. Originating from ancient Mesopotamia, these garments have been embraced by various cultures and continue to evolve in contemporary fashion. This article aims to explore accessorizing kaftans for a chic and personalized look, highlighting their versatility and enduring appeal across different fashion landscapes. The art of accessorizing Accessorizing is crucial for elevating the simple elegance of a kaftan into a statement outfit. The correct selection of accessories can highlight the kaftan's unique features, enhancing its design while adding sophistication. From selecting the right belts to choosing complementary jewelry, each accessory plays an essential role in crafting an ensemble that reflects personal style and elegance. Choose complementary jewelry Jewelry must enhance the kaftan without dominating it. For patterned kaftans, select simple jewelry like delicate chains or stud earrings. Solid-colored kaftans invite bolder choices, such as chunky necklaces or layered bracelets, adding texture and interest. Always consider the kaftan's neckline when selecting neckpieces to ensure the jewelry complements the outfit appropriately, maintaining a balanced and elegant look. Define your waistline Belts can be transformative when paired with kaftans, as they define your waistline and add structure to the garment. Opt for a thin belt in a matching color for a subtle approach. For a bolder statement, choose a wide belt or one adorned with embellishments. It's crucial to balance proportions to maintain an elegant silhouette, ensuring the belt complements rather than overwhelms the kaftan. Footwear matters The choice of footwear significantly influences your outfit's overall vibe. Sandals bring a casual ease, perfect for a laid-back look, while heels can elevate the ensemble, making it suitable for more formal occasions. For those donning longer kaftans, opting for strappy sandals or peep-toe heels is advisable. This choice helps to avoid a cumbersome appearance and maintains an airy, elegant feel throughout. Finishing touches with bags Complete your accessorized kaftan look with the right bag choice. A clutch is perfect for evening affairs, adding elegance, while tote bags fit daytime outings, offering practicality. Consider the texture and color—woven bags introduce rustic charm, and metallic clutches inject glamour. It's vital to ensure your bag complements other accessories for a cohesive and stylish ensemble, maintaining the outfit's overall elegance and personal flair.",

Fortunately, no injuries were reported as everyone present was safely evacuated from the premises. An official from Delhi Fire Services stated that six fire tenders have been pressed into service to douse the flames. 2 days after fire at children's hospital This comes just two days after the fire at a private children's hospital in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, which led to the death of seven newborns.

        "content": "The Mexican elote bowl is a vibrant, vegetarian dish inspired by traditional elote—grilled corn slathered in mayonnaise, cheese, and spices. This bowl adaptation offers these classic flavors in a hearty, healthy meal for vegetarians. It's an ideal choice for anyone looking to experience the essence of Mexican culture at their dining table. Let's begin cooking this colorful and nutritious meal. Gather the following ingredients For this dish, gather two cups cooked quinoa, four ears fresh corn, one cup rinsed and drained black beans, one sliced large avocado, one cup halved cherry tomatoes, half a cup finely chopped red onion, and a quarter cup chopped fresh cilantro. Dressing requires three tablespoons vegan mayonnaise, two tablespoons lime juice, one teaspoon paprika, and salt to taste. Prepare your ingredients Start by cooking your quinoa according to package instructions; this usually involves rinsing it thoroughly before boiling in water for about 15 minutes until it becomes fluffy. While the quinoa cooks, grill or broil your corn until slightly charred on all sides. Once cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cob and set aside. Assemble your elote bowl Begin assembling your elote bowl by placing a base layer of quinoa in individual bowls or a large serving dish. Next, evenly distribute the grilled corn kernels on top of the quinoa. Continue with the black beans, then add slices of avocado and halves of cherry tomatoes on top. Finish by sprinkling finely chopped red onion and fresh cilantro over the entire assembly. Prepare the dressing In a small bowl, whisk vegan mayonnaise and lime juice until smooth. Add paprika, blending for color and flavor, then season with salt to taste. This dressing combines all elements with its creamy, tangy, and spicy profile, perfectly complementing the elote bowl's ingredients. It's designed to bring a harmonious flavor to every bite, making the dish both vibrant and delicious. Final touches Before serving, lavishly drizzle the prepared dressing over each bowl to infuse every bite with flavor. For an extra dimension of taste and texture, adding crumbled vegan cheese or a dash of chili powder as optional garnishes is recommended. These additions not only elevate the dish's flavor but also its visual appeal, ensuring a delightful and comprehensive eating experience with every spoonful.",

        "content": "Milos, a volcanic island in the Cyclades, offers an array of stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters. Unlike its more famous neighbors, Milos retains a laid-back charm and unspoiled landscapes. It's the perfect destination for travelers seeking tranquility and natural beauty. The island's unique geological formations create breathtaking coastal scenery, making it an ideal spot for beach lovers. Sarakiniko Beach: Moon on Earth Sarakiniko Beach is famed for its moon-like landscape, with white volcanic rocks curving around a turquoise bay. This otherworldly scene provides not just a beach day but an experience unlike any other. The smooth, bone-white rocks are perfect for sunbathing or exploring small coves. Early morning or late afternoon visits offer softer light for photography and cooler temperatures for exploring. Kleftiko Caves: Nature's artwork Accessible only by boat, the Kleftiko Caves are a must-visit in Milos. Once a hideout for pirates, these sea caves and rock formations rise majestically from the emerald waters. Swimming or kayaking through the caves reveals hidden beaches and snorkeling spots teeming with marine life. Boat tours often include stories of pirate lore, adding a layer of intrigue to the natural beauty. Firiplaka Beach: A colorful retreat Firiplaka is one of Milos' most picturesque beaches, characterized by its towering cliffs and vibrant turquoise waters contrasted against soft white sands. The beach is partly organized with sunbeds and umbrellas but retains much of its natural charm with unspoiled sections ideal for relaxation. Its shallow waters make it perfect for families or those looking to wade into the Aegean without venturing too deep. Tsigrado Beach: An adventurous escape Tsigrado Beach offers an adventure before you even touch the sand—access involves descending a ladder and rope through a narrow cliff opening. This secluded cove rewards your efforts with crystal-clear waters surrounded by dramatic cliffs. Its remote nature means fewer crowds, providing a peaceful haven for swimming and soaking up the sun in relative solitude, making it a unique escape.",

        "content": "Rome , a city deeply rooted in history, is renowned not only for its ancient ruins and art masterpieces but also as a sanctuary for food enthusiasts. Many travelers, however, arrive with misconceptions regarding what constitutes authentic Roman cuisine. This guide is dedicated to dispelling prevalent culinary myths and directing you toward the true delicacies of Roman culinary tradition. Espresso etiquette in Rome Visitors often think that Italians drink their espresso any time of day. While it's true that coffee is a beloved beverage here, ordering a cappuccino after 11 a.m. might earn you some raised eyebrows. Romans typically enjoy milky coffees in the morning and stick to espresso or caffe normale post-lunch or dinner for its digestive properties. Pizza perceptions The myth that all Italian pizza resembles the thick-crusted American variety couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Rome. Roman pizza is thin-crust and crispy, almost cracker-like in texture. It's baked quickly at high temperatures, resulting in a light base perfect for simple yet flavorful toppings like tomato, mozzarella, basil (pizza Margherita), or just olive oil and rosemary (pizza bianca). Gelato guidelines Many believe brighter gelato means better flavor. However, in Rome, the reality is different. Authentic gelato prioritizes natural ingredients over artificial colors or flavors. Seek out gelaterias where the gelato has muted colors. This usually means they're made with real fruits and natural ingredients, signaling quality. In Rome, this authenticity in gelato is a true sign of excellence.",

        "content": "Utility wear has evolved beyond gender-specific boundaries, heralding the rise of unisex fashion . This movement signifies a shift toward clothing that emphasizes both function and comfort for everyone, regardless of gender. Through this article, we delve into the emergence of unisex utility wear, highlighting its primary features and offering insights on seamlessly integrating it into your daily routine for improved efficiency. The rise of unisex fashion Unisex clothing has been around for decades, but its mainstream acceptance is recent. This shift, driven by desires for equality and practicality, has led designers to create garments that challenge traditional gender norms. This movement aligns with societal trends toward inclusivity and versatility in fashion, reflecting a significant change in how apparel is viewed and designed. Defining utility wear Utility wear is clothing designed for practicality, featuring multiple pockets, durable fabrics, and adjustable features. It marries form with function, creating garments that serve the wearer's needs without sacrificing style. This fashion is for those who value both efficiency and elegance, proving that clothes can be both functional and fashionable, working as hard as the wearer does. How to style utility pieces Styling unisex utility wear focuses on balance. Combine robust items like cargo pants or a utility vest with simple, basic garments such as plain tees or sweaters. For footwear, choose sneakers or boots that enhance the functional aesthetic. The aim is to achieve effortless efficiency, allowing the utility elements to stand out as the main feature of your outfit. Sustainability meets function Unisex utility wear transcends mere practicality, emerging as a sustainable fashion choice. By prioritizing durable quality over fleeting quantity and versatile design over momentary trends, these garments foster reduced consumption and encourage the cultivation of more deliberate, thoughtful wardrobes. This approach not only benefits your daily efficiency but also significantly contributes to environmental sustainability—a dual victory for personal convenience and global health. Cross-cultural appeal Utility wear's global appeal crosses cultural boundaries with its adaptability and practicality. From Tokyo 's streets to Toronto 's urban landscapes, utility pieces integrate into local styles while maintaining core functionality. This universal appeal shows practical fashion knows no limits, resonating across cultures worldwide. It proves utility wear's versatility and ease of use, making it a truly borderless fashion choice.",

        "content": "Saag paneer is a celebrated vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent, known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. It features paneer , fresh cheese, and saag , usually mustard leaves or spinach. This dish is significant in Indian culture, often served during festivals and special occasions. Deeply rooted in tradition, saag paneer is favored for its taste and nutritional benefits. Let's get cooking! Gather the following ingredients To prepare this delightful dish, you will need 250 grams of paneer (cubed), 500 grams of spinach (washed and chopped), two tablespoons of vegetable oil, one large onion (finely chopped), one tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, two green chilies (chopped), one teaspoon cumin seeds, half a teaspoon turmeric powder, one teaspoon coriander powder, half a teaspoon garam masala powder, salt to taste, and one cup water. Preparing the spinach puree Begin by blanching the spinach in boiling water for two minutes to preserve its vibrant green color. Immediately after, transfer it to ice-cold water to stop the cooking process, ensuring nutrients and color are retained. After cooling in cold water for about five minutes, thoroughly drain the spinach. Then, use a blender or food processor to blend it into a smooth puree. Cooking the base gravy Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding chopped onions. Saute until golden brown, then mix in ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook until the raw smell fades, about three minutes. Finally, stir in turmeric and coriander powder, blending them well into the mixture. Adding spinach puree and paneer Add the spinach puree to the pan with your base gravy and season with salt to taste. Allow this mix to simmer on low heat for 10 minutes, enabling the flavors to blend well. If necessary, incorporate up to one cup of water to adjust the consistency as preferred, ensuring the mixture achieves a smooth and desirable texture. Final touches and serving suggestions Gently add the cubed paneer to the simmering saag mixture, cooking for five minutes. Avoid a vigorous boil to prevent the paneer from hardening. Sprinkle garam masala over the dish before turning off the heat. Carefully mix, ensuring not to break the paneer cubes too much. This step ensures flavors meld without compromising the paneer 's texture.",

        "content": "The 2024 ICC T20 World Cup is set to begin on June 1. Like the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) season, batters will be looking to cash in during the mega ICC tournament. However, slow and dry pitches in the Caribbean might give them a run for the money. Here are the batters with most fifty-plus scores in a T20 WC edition. Virat Kohli: 14 Virat Kohli holds the record for scoring the most runs in T20 World Cup history. He owns 1,141 runs from 27 games at an incredible average of 81.50. Notably, Kohli remains the only player with more than 10 fifty-plus scores in the tournament. He has recorded 14 such scores as of now. Notably, three of those half-centuries have come in the semi-finals. Chris Gayle: 9 West Indies veteran batter Chris Gayle has nine 50+ scores in the T20 World Cup. Universe Boss Gayle is the only player to have scored multiplte centuries in the tournament (2). His tally also includes seven fifties. Gayle has slammed 965 runs from 33 T20 World Cup games at 34.46. He has a strike-rate of 142.75 in the tournament. Rohit Sharma: 9 Like Gayle, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma owns nine fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. However, he is yet to score a century in this regard. Rohit has scored 963 runs from 39 T20 WC encounters at an average of 34.39. However, his strike-rate of 127.88 is on the lower side. His highest score of 79* came against Australia at Bridgetown in 2010. Mahela Jayawardene: 7 Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene remains the only other batter with more than six fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. He owns seven such scores. The former batter guided Sri Lanka to 21 wins, also tallying a ton. Notably, Jayawardene also starred in Sri Lanka's title-winning run in 2014. Overall, he owns 1,016 runs at 39.07 in the T20 World Cup.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday criticized the opposition's handling of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir . In an interview with news agency ANI , PM Modi claimed that the article was not an issue for the people of Jammu and Kashmir or India, but was manipulated for the benefit of a select few. \"Article 370 was the agenda of only 4-5 families,\" Modi stated, taking a veiled jibe at the opposition. Modi highlights unity post Article 370 abrogation Modi further stated that the removal of Article 370 has fostered a greater sense of unity and belonging among the people of Kashmir. Article 370...was neither the agenda of the people of Kashmir nor the agenda of the people of the country...Today it has become true that after the removal of 370, there is a feeling of more unity. The feeling of belongingness is increasing among the people of Kashmir...its direct result is also visible in elections, tourism,\" he said. Record voter turnouts post Article 370 abrogation According to reports, following the abrogation of Article 370 by Modi's government in August 2019, record voter turnouts were observed in several parliamentary constituencies during the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this month. Srinagar , Baramulla , and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded polling percentages of 38.49%, 59.1%, and 51.35% respectively—the highest rates since 1989. \"When the common man votes there, it is not just to make someone win, voting means that the voter accepts the Constitution of India,\" he said. Modi's statement on voter turnout in Kashmir \"As a result, voting records of 40 years have been broken. It is a matter of greatest satisfaction for me that my brothers and sisters from Kashmir came forward to vote with great enthusiasm,\" PM Modi said. \"By voting, they have given a message to the world and to those who used to have doubts,\" he further said. 'Decision of government always for good cause' The PM added that the decisions of his government were always for a good cause. I would like to pray to the justice system of our country that if...government wants to do any work, they have a...strategy to do that work...Sometimes I had to shut down the internet...Some NGO went to court and it became a big issue in the court...but today the children there proudly say...we have been getting all the facilities for the last 5 years,\" he said.",

        "content": "Edinburgh , the picturesque capital of Scotland , is steeped in history and charm. It's also famously known as the birthplace of the Harry Potter series, where J.K. Rowling penned much of her early work. For fans of the series or those curious about its origins, a tour around Edinburgh's historic Harry Potter landmarks offers a unique and enchanting experience. The birthplace of Harry Potter The Elephant House Cafe claims fame as the spot where J.K. Rowling spent many hours writing over cups of coffee. With views overlooking Edinburgh Castle, it's easy to see where she might have found some of her inspiration for Hogwarts. Visitors can enjoy a warm beverage and soak in the atmosphere that helped birth one of the most beloved book series in history. A real-life Diagon Alley Just a short walk from the cafe is Victoria Street, widely believed to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley. This colorful and winding street is lined with independent shops that could easily belong in the wizarding world. From boutiques selling quirky items to specialty food stores, it's a must-visit for anyone wanting to step into a real-life magical shopping street. Where Tom Riddle rests Greyfairs Kirkyard is not just any cemetery; it serves as the resting place for Thomas Riddell's grave. Fans widely speculate that this inspired the name of Rowling's character, Tom Riddle. A walk through this historic graveyard does more than connect visitors with Edinburgh's ancient past; it also provides a tangible link to one of Harry Potter's most notorious characters, enriching the experience. Hogwarts' inspiration George Heriot's School, with its four distinctive towers and central courtyard, strikingly resembles Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is not open for public tours on a daily basis as it remains an operational school. However, the exterior view still captivates fans and onlookers from a distance, igniting imaginations about the mysteries that lie within its walls, much like the fictional Hogwarts.",

        "content": "Under Rohit Sharma 's leadership, India will fight for their second title in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup . The Men in Blue have been placed in Group A alongside arch-rivals Pakistan, hosts USA, Ireland, and Canada. Notably, India have been away from the glory since lifting the trophy in the inaugural edition in 2007. Here we decode India's worst T20 WC campaigns. Super 8 ouster in 2009 Defending champions India endured a forgettable campaign in the 2009 edition in England. They comfortably advanced to the Super 8 stage after defeating Ireland and Bangladesh in the league round. However, MS Dhoni's were eliminated after losing all their three Super 8 matches, against South Africa, West Indies, and England. The team would have been gutted as all three games were pretty close. Another terrible show in 2010 India's campaign in the 2010 competition was no better. They again won both their league matches, against South Africa and Afghanistan. The SA game saw Suresh Raina score a stunning hundred. However, Dhoni's men yet again lost all their three Super 8 fixtures. While they couldn't compete much against Australia and hosts West Indies, Sri Lanka beat them in a last-ball thriller. Missed semi-final berth in 2012 India's 2012 T20 WC campaign was an interesting one. The Men in Blue thrashed England and Afghanistan in the league round. They even defeated Pakistan and SA in the Super 8 stage. However, India's only defeat in the competition cost them. Australia severely dented their NRR by chasing down 141 against them in 14.5 overs. India hence missed the semi-final berth. Forgettable campaign in 2021 Virat Kohli 's only T20 WC campaign as a captain was a forgettable one. India's tournament opener saw Pakistan beat them for the first time in a WC match. They further lost their next fixture against New Zealand. The two successive defeats virtually knocked India out as they missed out on a semi-final berth despite beating Afghanistan, Namibia, and Scotland in their remaining league games.",

        "content": "A three-year collaborative research project between US scientists and the University of Cape Town in South Africa has revealed that the rate of plastic degradation is color-dependent. The study, spearheaded by the University of Leicester , discovered that red, blue, and green plastics become \"very brittle and fragmented\" over time. Conversely, black, white, and silver plastics were found to remain \"largely unaffected.\" Retailers are advised against using brightly colored plastics In light of these findings, retailers are now being encouraged to avoid using brightly colored plastics for everyday items such as drinks bottles, outdoor furniture, and toys. This advice stems from the research conclusion that colored plastics break down into microplastics faster than their less vibrant counterparts. Microplastics have been found in various environments, including human testicles, where they have been potentially linked to declining sperm counts. Research methodology and findings across continents The study involved US researchers placing bottle lids of various colors on a university rooftop for three years to expose them to sun and weather. Simultaneously, scientists in South Africa examined plastic items found on a remote beach. Both studies revealed significant differences in microplastic formation based on the color of the plastic. Dr. Sarah Key, who led the project, found it amazing that samples from a Leicester rooftop and a windy beach in Africa showed similar results. Brightly colored plastics: A concern for short-lived products Key added that even in a relatively cool and cloudy environment for only three years, significant differences can be seen in microplastic formation. This pioneering field study suggests that retailers and manufacturers should reconsider using brightly colored plastics, particularly for short-lived products. The results have been published in the journal Environmental Pollution . Co-author of the study, Professor Sarah Gabbott, shared her curiosity about why microplastics in beach sand frequently exhibit a rainbow of colors. Colored plastics: A barrier to recycling Initially, Gabbott believed she was noticing more colorful microplastics due to their visibility, but she later discovered that brightly colored microplastics are genuinely more common. This is due to red, green, and blue pigmented plastic items being more susceptible to fragmentation into millions of tiny yet colorful microplastic particles. Adam Herriott from Wrap, an anti-waste charity organization explained that colored plastics have traditionally been used to make products stand out. However, Wrap now advises manufacturers to avoid using pigments. Why do colored plastics degrade more quickly? The study unveiled that black, white, and silver pigments provide protection to plastics against detrimental ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV exposure induces structural alterations in plastics, resulting in brittleness and susceptibility to fragmentation. However, these particular pigments serve as effective shields, safeguarding the plastic polymers from UV-induced damage. Consequently, they maintain the structural integrity of plastics, mitigating the adverse effects of UV exposure on their composition and durability.",

        "content": "The Indian government is planning a significant skill upgrade for its professional workforce. This initiative aims to meet the anticipated demand for jobs in developed economies over the next five years. The official projections suggest that 3.58 million job vacancies will be available in 16 countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Canada , and others. These estimates are based on a study done by the National Skill Development Corporation International (NSDCI), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Strategy to boost international mobility for Indian workers The NSDCI study, titled 'International Workforce Mobility,' is designed to develop a strategy that enhances international mobility for Indian employees in the target countries. It is estimated that 68% of India's total population is between 15-64 years of age. This large working-age population presents India with a chance to create a high-quality skilled workforce for the world. Professionals are encouraged to register on the MSDE portal, where they will be scrutinized and provided with essential skill upgrade training by NSDC. Government coordination for deployment of skilled professionals Following the skill upgrade, the Indian government will coordinate with various partner countries to facilitate the deployment of the candidates. The skill upgrading process is tailored to refine professionals' skills to meet certain standards and practices of respective countries. For instance, a path lab attendant or an electrician, would need to know about the latest requirements of their prospective country. This strategic approach will ensure that Indian professionals are well-equipped and ready for their roles in foreign job markets. Experts' views on projected job opportunities Despite the government's projections, some experts have expressed reservations. The Vice-Chancellor of Dr B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics University in Bengaluru , N.R. Bhanumurthy, stated, \"These numbers are slightly lower than our expectations.\" He added that Indians are highly sought after in many countries where skilled labor is required, and that demand for the Indian workforce has grown significantly. Projected job openings in various sectors and countries The NSDCI study indicates demand for workforce in healthcare, manufacturing, and IT sectors across Europe , Asia, and Australia . In Gulf nations, job openings are projected in construction, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. The highest vacancies are projected at one million each in UAE, Saudi Arabia, followed by 390,000 in the US and 320,000 each in Canada and Qatar. Australia should have 54,000 job openings, while Germany is anticipated to have 37,000 openings for Indian workers over next five years.",

        "content": "Lima , the capital of Peru , is a vibrant city that boasts a rich history and a dynamic culinary scene. Known as the gastronomic capital of South America , Lima offers an array of dishes that reflect its diverse culture and heritage. From street food to fine dining, the city's food landscape is as varied as it is delicious. Ceviche: Peru's national dish Ceviche is arguably the most iconic dish in Peru. This refreshing dish consists of fresh ingredients marinated in citrus juices, typically lime, and spiced with chili peppers. It's often accompanied by sides of sweet potato and corn. The acidity from the lime juice \"cooks\" the ingredients without heat, resulting in a light and flavorful dish that perfectly captures the essence of Peruvian cuisine. Lomo saltado: A fusion favorite Lomo Saltado represents the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese culinary traditions. This stir-fry combines marinated strips of soy sauce-seasoned tofu (a vegetarian twist on the traditional beef), onions, tomatoes and peppers served with rice and crispy potatoes. The result is a savory dish that showcases Peru's ability to blend different culinary influences into something uniquely its own. Quinoa salad: Andean superfood Quinoa has been cultivated in the Andes for thousands of years and has gained international recognition for its health benefits. In Lima, you'll find quinoa salad made with this nutritious grain mixed with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, avocados seasoned with lime juice and herbs. It's not only healthy but also incredibly tasty—a testament to Lima's ability to make even simple ingredients shine. Picarones: Sweet finish Picarones are Peru's answer to doughnuts but made from sweet potato flour mixed with squash flour, which gives them their unique taste. These rings are deep-fried until golden brown then drizzled with chancaca syrup—a sweet concoction made from unrefined sugar cane juice spiced with cinnamon and cloves. Enjoying picarones under Lima's sky makes for an unforgettable dessert experience.",

        "content": "India 's IT sector has been hit by a wave of 'silent' layoffs between 2023 and 2024. The All India IT & ITeS Employees's Union (AIITEU) reports that approximately 20,000 tech professionals lost their jobs in this period. The AIITEU suggests the actual number could be higher but remains unreported. These layoffs have occurred across IT services firms of all sizes. Silent layoff practices and their impact in 2024 Silent layoffs are a common practice among firms, discreetly letting go of employees. The most prevalent method involves giving a worker 30 days to secure a new role within the same firm. If unsuccessful, the employee is asked to leave. In 2024 alone, between 2,000-3,000 employees lost their jobs at top Indian IT services companies, according to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). Major companies implementing silent layoffs US-based Teradata, a cloud analytics and data platform company, axed around 35-40 employees from its Hyderabad campus at the end of 2023. This followed a global layoff of approximately 1,100 employees in 2022. Boston-based financial services firm State Street took over Atos Syntel's operations here last year, and reportedly let go of around 400-500 employees in March 2024, as part of streamlining operations. Layoffs continue across major IT firms Reports indicate that similar layoffs are occurring across Accenture , Infosys , and Cognizant. In 2024, Infosys reportedly asked nearly 200-500 employees to voluntarily resign. However, both Infosys and Atos Group have denied these allegations of layoffs. Industry experts have labeled this period as one of the highest layoff years post the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Expert insight on the current layoff scenario Yugal Joshi, leader of technology services research at Everest Group, attributes challenging macroeconomic scenarios as a contributing factor to the layoffs . He stated, \"All of them promised to maintain or increase operating margin and for a service company beyond people reduction there are not many credible levers.\" Joshi expressed concern about service providers trimming their smaller-sized clients, as lost clients are rarely regained.",

        "content": "Holland & Barrett, a leading health food chain in the United Kingdom , has come under fire for its new product—a dark chocolate bar that claims to alleviate menopause symptoms. The 75g bar, retailing at £3.79, is marketed as a soothing aid contributing to \"the regulation of hormonal activity.\" It contains vitamin B6, typically found in almonds. However, this product has been met with strong disapproval from menopause campaigner Kate Muir who called it a \"ridiculous money-making product.\" Accusations of exploitation, insensitivity Muir accused Holland & Barrett of exploiting vulnerable women, emphasizing the need for proper medical help from the NHS. She highlighted the alarming increase in suicide rates among perimenopausal women. This sentiment was mirrored on social media , where users dismissed the product as \"insulting\" and \"patronizing profiteering tosh.\" The controversy escalated when it was revealed that these chocolate bars contain a woman's entire daily allowance of saturated fat. Holland & Barrett defends their product In response to the backlash, a spokesperson for Holland & Barrett defended the product—stating that their food range aims to offer functional alternatives to popular snacks. The company emphasized that the chocolate bar and its contents contribute to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. They described it as a small indulgence with added benefits compared to other bars. They assured customers of guidance from trained advisors in their stores on how vitamins or herbal supplements may aid with menopause symptoms.",

        "content": "Greensboro and Guilford County elected officials are considering whether to approve performance-based incentive packages for what is known as “Project Mercury” for an industrial property in east Greensboro. The county Board of Commissioners appears to be the first to consider the economic-development project with a public hearing set for 5:30 p.m. June 6 in the Old County Courthouse at 301 W. Market St. in Greensboro. The unidentified company behind Project Mercury is requesting up to $373,855 in incentives from the county. It also is making incentive requests from Greensboro City Council and the N.C. Commerce Department, the latter involved because the company is considering locations out of North Carolina. In exchange, the company would commit to a $26.94 million capital investment and 80 jobs, both by Dec. 31, 2028, at 3617 McConnell Road. People are also reading... The prospective Class A industrial building is in McConnell Business Park and is being marketed for lease, along with 3655 McConnell Road, by the Triad office of CBRE. The 3617 McConnell building contains 104,629 square feet. The 3655 McConnell property features 120,368 square feet, while there is a proposed third building under consideration at 140,273 square feet. The site became available as an industrial site in June 2022 when a Cincinnati industrial real-estate firm paid $2.33 million to purchase a combined 35.88 acres. The properties were a 29.8-acre tract at 3635 McConnell Road and a 6.02-acre tract at 3617 McConnell Road. The buyer was McConnell Road Industrial I LLC, an affiliate of Al. Neyer of Cincinnati, which entered the North Carolina market in 2019 with an office in Raleigh. Al. Neyer’s listing of the McConnell property touts neighboring Coca-Cola, Vistar and Walmart facilities. “Central North Carolina has been the epicenter of a string of recent job announcements from major manufacturers, such as Toyota, Boom Supersonic, VinFast and Wolfspeed,” according to the listing. “The companies have unveiled plans to construct advanced manufacturing facilities that will employ more than 13,000 people. “The projects are expected to drive significant ancillary activity among suppliers and support industries, fueling future demand for industrial space across central North Carolina, including Greensboro.” Al. Neyer also lists Buckhorn Industrial Park in Mebane and Haw River Industrial Park in Graham among its other eight N.C. developments. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly. {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

        "content": "The Jacksonville City Council adopted its Fiscal Year 2025 budget last Tuesday evening, and here’s everything you need to know. The FY25 budget goes from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Some of the highlights in this year’s budget include no change in the tax rate, remaining at $.60, a 2.25% water and sewer rate increase and a $4 recycling and residential sanitation rate increase. The total proposed budget is $119,436,756, which breaks down as follows: This proposed budget is roughly $8,000,000 less than last year’s amended budget which totaled $127,345,478. During the Jacksonville City Council’s budget retreat, they came up with several goals or initiatives to be the focus of this year’s budget. These included pay plan integrity, fee schedule review, recreation land development, citizen/cultural engagement efforts, economic impact — housing and development, street improvements, cultural competency and awareness, downtown development and Unified Development Ordinance review. In the City of Jacksonville Proposed Budget Fiscal Year 2024-2025 that can be found in full on the city of Jacksonville’s website, the foundation of the budget is built on maintaining the integrity of the employee compensation and pay plan. Therefore, the proposed budget includes a market and merit pay increase of 5%. The Capital Improvement Plan was another important piece, critical for how the city makes improvements to city systems, budget documents explain. City systems include things like parks, facilities, water, sewer and other capital-defined items. This year’s budget has also been developed with the intention of preparing for major investments in city facilities over the next five years, through 2030 or so. Budget documents say these capital investments will be a focal point during FY25. This year, the city also developed a new strategy for evaluating requests for new employees. According to budget documents, this process was developed through discussions with each department regarding their mission, their ability to effectively accomplish that mission, and their ability to do more within their existing resources. The proposed budget also includes a number of Capital Improvement projects that are currently underway or will begin in the new fiscal year. The FY25 projects actually represent $10,262,500 of Capital Improvements, and include street rehabilitation, water and sewer improvements, recreation development and building improvements. One concept also taking affect in this year’s budget is the aforementioned increase in sanitation fees. According to the budget documents, the fee increases will help the city’s sanitation fund move closer to operating as a true enterprise fund, also further decreasing the demand on the general fund, effectively freeing up that money to provide for other needs and services. As previously stated, Capital Improvement Plan projects are a major part of the FY25 budget. At this time, however, the Capital Improvement Plan does not specifically list the Recreation and Sports Complex as a funded capital project because city council is awaiting an update to the Recreation and Parks Master Plan. Some of the notable projects being funded in FY25 include the Northwoods Community Center expansion, Jacksonville Station Phase 2, an upfit to the Center for Public Safety, improvements to Court Street, an upgrade to the Commons Pump Station, the Commons Challenge Courts & Trail, the Downtown Transit Transfer Station and more. The city also used a Five-Year Consolidated Plan to assess affordable housing and community development needs. The Annual Action Plan is the process by which the consolidated plan is then implemented into the fabric of the community. Requests from the community this year included in the FY25 budget include $200,000 to Carolina Statewide Development LLC for a 72-unit low-income housing project, $180,000 to ECCDI for a 44-unit homeless housing project, $5,000 to Williams Outreach for rapid re-housing services, $15,000 to Onslow Women’s Outreach for a women’s shelter, $20,000 to Onslow Community Outreach for a women’s shelter and $10,000 to Philippians Place for a homeless coaching program. In addition, requests were made for $10,000 to Pretrial Resource Center for Judicial System Support programs, $5,000 to United Way of Onslow for local nonprofit support, $10,000 to Onslow County PEERS for family development programs, $10,000 to the WARM Program for a home repair program and $30,000 to Boys & Girls Club for youth development programs. There is also community support funding outside of the Annual Action Plan. This year, this includes things like the $1.5 million contribution to the YMCA pool project, $333,333 to One Place for their new facility, $100,000 to the Dix Crisis Intervention Center and a total of $50,000 in opioid support funds.

        "content": "Israel's foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players quit Argentina's women's squad on Monday in a dispute over not being paid and conditions at a camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benítez, all regular starters, walked out. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on Instagram . “We need improvements for Argentina’s women’s soccer national team, and I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.” Cruz and Benítez said during national squad training sessions they received a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana, which they consider inadequate for high-performance athletes. They said the Argentine Football Association told them they won't be paid for the friendlies against Costa Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. Benitez added their family members were being charged 5,000 pesos ($5) for match tickets. “And there there are millions of things we have gone through,\" the midfielder added. Oliveros wrote on Instagram , “With a broken heart and thousands of dreams disappearing little by little. May the next generations enjoy and be happy running after the football, as we were sometime ago.\" AFA did not comment on the players' decision. Estefanía Banini, considered the country's best female player ever, supported her three former teammates. Last year, she also decided to stop playing for the national team. “A matter of time. Thanks for being willing to speak about it,” the Atletico Madrid midfielder said on her social media channels. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- InsightAce Analytic Pvt. Ltd. announces the release of a market assessment report on the Sulfur pastilles find applications beyond agriculture and sulphuric acid production, including in chemical manufacturing, mining, and oil refining industries. The expansion of these industrial sectors drives additional demand for sulfur pastilles. Ongoing research and development efforts to improve sulfur pastille formulations, production processes, and application methods contribute to market growth. Innovations in technology lead to more efficient and effective use of sulfur pastilles across various industries. The sulfur pastilles serve as essential soil amendments to improve soil health and crop productivity. The market is fueled by the increasing demand for sulphuric acid production, as sulfur pastilles are a crucial feedstock. However, challenges such as limited solubility may hinder their effectiveness in specific applications. These changes may include incentives for using sulfur-based fertilizers and stricter regulations on chemical usage, further driving demand for sulfur pastilles in various industries. Factors such as agricultural practices, industrial demand, sulfur availability, and regulatory policies influence market growth and trends in sulfur pastilles. The agricultural sector is a major driver of the sulfur pastilles market, with sulfur being an essential nutrient for crop growth and soil health.

This ratio remains the same for a holder of £1 as it does for one with the maximum holding of £50,000. \"The only distinction between them is that the holder of £50,000 has more 'entries' into the monthly draw.

He said: \"Some ideas I've thought could help are capping the maximum number of Bonds held to limit very high chances of winning, combining that with a tiered prize structure, and possibly rewarding longer-term investors with a small return guarantee. \"Spreading out smaller but more frequent wins across modest and significant bondholders alike also seems a sensible adjustment.\" For the latest personal finance news, follow us on Twitter at @ExpressMoney_.

        "content": "Every week for the past several months, I’ve been writing about Donald Trump’s legal troubles, and I’ve gotten to see, time and time again, how he has fought tooth and nail to delay and derail his criminal hush money case. Last week, I finally got to see Trump in the flesh as he strode into the Manhattan courtroom, a scowl on his face, frowning at just about every person there, including the 12 jurors who are about to decide his fate. Trump sat sandwiched between his attorneys and flanked by his son Don Jr. and adviser Boris Epshteyn. As his defense team rested its case, each member of the jury sat upright and watched the day’s proceedings intently. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury is expected to begin its deliberations the following day. Its members have to consider. Over the past six weeks, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has presented his case for why Trump should be convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, bringing in witnesses who described how badly Trump wanted to protect his image ahead of the 2016 election: , the former CEO of American Media Inc., and Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and personal fixer. Pecker confirmed he used his tabloid empire to kill negative stories about Trump, while Cohen, the prosecution’s star witness, testified that Trump instructed him to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election to protect his presidential campaign and prevent Daniels from going public about her affair with Trump. In order to find Trump guilty of felony record-keeping fraud, the jury must unanimously agree that the prosecution has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump falsified records when making payments to Cohen that he did so with the intent to conceal another crime, like the violation of election laws. Trump’s attorneys have argued that the payments to Cohen were simply legal fees, while the prosecutors have spent the entire trial trying to prove they were actually reimbursements for the payment Cohen made to Daniels to preserve Trump’s standing with the voting public before Election Day. Even one deflection will lead to a hung jury—meaning no verdict is reached and Trump is neither convicted nor acquitted. “If they’re responsible jurors, they’re going to take some time, regardless of whether they have strong feelings about the case, to go through the instructions and walk through what the different witnesses proved in their minds and debate with each other,” , a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Lonergan expects jury members to take at least a few days, if not a couple of weeks, to come to a decision. And if they ask New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan for readbacks—transcripts of trial testimony to refresh their memory about what certain witnesses said on the stand—that will only add time to the deliberation process. A major factor in the jury’s deliberations will be how reliable the group believes Cohen to be. He has been convicted of lying to Congress once before—even serving prison time—and has admitted to having a vendetta against Trump. However, during the hush money trial, he has maintained to the jury that he told his past lies “in order to protect” his former boss. Currently, the jury is being asked to decide whether to convict Trump on felony charges alone. However, Merchan could introduce “ ,” allowing the jury to convict Trump on misdemeanor charges instead. This would require the defense to waive its statute of limitations, since misdemeanor charges can be pursued only within a two-year window of the crime, according to New York law. However, if Trump’s attorneys want to limit a more damaging verdict, it might be in their favor to offer the jury lesser charges to consider. “A misdemeanor charge just requires proof that the former president intentionally falsified business records, but to convict on a felony, the jury would have to believe that the former president did so with the intent to conceal another crime,” , senior director at the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, explained to Slate. It’s not yet clear whether misdemeanor charges will be thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, the type of white-collar felony that Trump faces typically brings a prison sentence of one to four years. All the experts Slate spoke to believe that Trump won’t actually spend time behind bars. “First-time offender in New York City? Zero prison time,” said Adam Pollock, a former New York assistant attorney general. He thinks Trump, if convicted, will likely have to serve just probation, since his case deals with a nonviolent crime and a relatively small amount of money—Daniels was paid $130,000 in her hush money deal. Probation allows a defendant to remain out of prison with some restrictions on their liberty. In Trump’s case, the exact terms of his probation would be determined by Merchan, and they could include having to wear an ankle monitor, attending regular check-ins with an assigned probation officer, and completing community service. He might also be required to get permission anytime he travels, and his probation officer would have the legal right to make unannounced visits to his home. If the jury cannot come to a unanimous decision, then Merchan would be forced to declare a mistrial, and though not acquitted of the charges, Trump would be free to walk. Bragg would need to decide whether he wants to retry Trump all over again. An important piece of that calculus will be finding out why the jury couldn’t reach a verdict. “ ” said Eisen. “ There will be a lot of things that the office will want to consider before retrying.” And if the jury finds Trump guilty, he will most likely appeal the verdict. Similar to Trump’s civil fraud case, he would need to while the appeal plays out, which would take months, at a",

        "description": "Following Wednesday's election, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders, but the IEC vote counters.",
        "content": "For voters, the 2024 elections process promises to be simple enough: Arrive at a polling station, out your ‘X’ in the box, and then enjoy the rest of the public holiday as we wait to see who will be in parliament by the end of the week. Bookmark The South African website’s Elections 2024 hub for the latest news you need to know But for those in charge of counting up the actual votes, it’s not as simple. On Wednesday night, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders. No, that honour will belong to the Electoral Commission (IEC) officials and volunteers who make voting days possible. A large chunk of them will be tallying up the votes throughout the night. So, just how does the commission decide how many seats each party gets in our National Assembly? We’ve put together a brief explainer on the subject, to help you understand how the democratic process works. Calculators at the ready... HOW THE IEC DECIDE THE NUMBER OF SEATS EACH PARTY GETS IN PARLIAMENT There are 400 seats to play for in total. That’s how many MPs serve in parliament during a five-year term. Official IEC data suggests that there are 27.7 million registered voters ready to go this campaign, but they are expecting a voter turnout of between 65% to 70%. That suggests around 18.7 million South Africans will cast their vote. So, let’s say the election turns out something like this on Wednesday, in terms of how many votes each party receives. If we assume the majority of the votes go to five established parties, it could look something like this: HOW DOES THE ‘QUOTA’ AFFECT THE VOTE? Now, to translate those numbers into Parliamentary seats: IEC officials will have to divide the total number of votes (18.7 million) by the number of parliamentary seats (400), in order to generate a “quota”. On the face of it, things seem simple: You simply divide the number of votes for each party by the quota, and you get the total number of seats they should win. However, there’s another devil in the detail. In order to make sure the votes are more fairly reflected, +1 is added to the total number of seats, meaning the official calculation is as follows: The quota is the benchmark for how many votes each party needs to gain one seat in parliament. By doing the aforementioned sum, that gives us 46 634 . So Party D, for example, would just be able to scrape one MP into the house with their total of 47 000. Sjoe, we know it’s a little complicated. But basically, adding the +1 to 400 means that an extra seat is actually left open after doing the division. With 399 seats decided, the last one goes to the party with the “highest remainder”, once their total votes from across the nation has been divided by the quota. REMEMBER THE REMAINDER As you can see, Party E has the biggest remainder of 0.951. Rather than letting all those votes go to waste, they actually end up counting as an extra seat in parliament. Clever that, isn’t it? And, as we’ve practically given away while trying to explain the remainder, our “proportional representation” system of voting means that a party which gets 52.5% of the votes will get 52.5% of the seats in parliament. For every 0.25% of the vote each party receives, that’s worth one MP getting elected to parliament. You can now consider yourself up to speed, even if you did have to have two or three reads of how everything works. We’re going to take a lie down, and thank our lucky stars we aren’t the ones doing long division in the early hours of Thursday morning!",

By Adenike Kaffi The Chairman, Board Of Trustees, Al- Habibiyyah Islamic Society, Dr Kola Adeyemi, has charged Muslim clerics and imams on the need for self development as a means to avert eating ‘from the dustbin’. He explained that Imams and Islamic scholars are teachers who should lead from the front and show good leadership examples in the fight against corruption and any ills of the society. Adeyemi added that this would only be achievable when the Imams sustain themselves from halal means and sources and not from questionable sources. Adeyemi gave the advice on Saturday, during the opening of a two- day workshop themed: “Creating a Resilient Faith-Based Community For Sustained Accountability Messaging”. The workshop supported by MacArthur Foundation and held in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, was to ensure that Imams and Islamic scholars, are enlightened on the different ways they can contribute to societal growth and fight corruption and societal ills. Speaking further, Adeyemi stressed that the government should partner with religious leaders who will not divert whatever attention given to them towards negativity or mislead the society. “Those who will appreciate the enormous influence that they have and use it towards the advancement of the course of governance.The government should be able to identify what they want without mincing word and not to play politics with religion”, he said. Adeyemi, who is also the Executive Director, The Just Foundation, also hinted that the society also trains Islamic clerics in agricultural activities and its value chain. Also speaking, a member of the society, Imam Fuad Adeyemi, said the Al-Habibiyya society has been embarking on feeding programmes for refugees in collaboration with the United Nations Commission for Refugees. In their feedbacks, the Imam, Al-Habibiyya Society, Imam Idris Adisa and Mrs Wasilat Abiola urged Muslim clerics to be at the forefront in the fight against corruption and emulate good habits as that is what the society stands for.

        "content": "Featuring a massive A-list star, it won two Oscars. Our TV movie pick for tonight (Tuesday, 28 May) is Born on the Fourth of July , the 1989 biographical anti-war drama starring Tom Cruise. Earning his first Oscar nomination for his performance in the film, Cruise plays the real-life Ron Kovic – a young patriotic American who enlists to serve in the Vietnam War where he becomes permanently paralysed in battle. Struggling with his paralysis and an uncaring, bureaucratic United States upon returning home, he becomes an anti-war and pro-human rights political activist. Part of co-writer and director Oliver Stone’s Vietnam War trilogy – which also includes Platoon and Heaven & Earth – Born on the Fourth of July’s powerful real life story, its visceral filmmaking and Cruise’s intense and transformational performance made the movie a massive critical and commercial success. It was even nominated for eight Oscars and won two – with Stone taking home the Best Director trophy. Born on the Fourth of July is airing on TV tonight on Film4 at 9pm . It is also available to rent on Apple TV, Google Play, Rakuten TV and the Sky Store.

        "description": "Belgium commits USD 1 billion to Ukraine as Zelenskyy continues his whistlestop European tour",
        "content": "BRUSSELS: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday picked up a second USD 1 billion promise of military aid in as many days for his war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Zelenskyy sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. A day earlier, Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros (USD 1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros (USD 5.4 billion) by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary's objections to the bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros (USD 7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia's staunchest ally in the 27-nation bloc. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine's defence efforts. Zelenskyy met with Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built \"in a short time frame.\" The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. \"Ukraine is also fighting Europe's fight,\" she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. \"We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,\" Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters ahead of the meeting. \"The urgency is very, very acute.\" Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia's response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine's biggest military test since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia's bigger army and air force.",

Despite the one receiving the serve, it is Rybakina who is making her opponent move all across the court with strong forehands and dropshots. Once again, it is break point and Rybakina deals with the second serve quickly. Share 5m ago 05.57 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-3 Rybakina* (denotes server) The games in which Rybakina serve end much more quickly with a few aces to wrap things up. Nine games in a row with wins for Rybakina in this match. Minnen is not able to get a sniff. We get a quick shot of the other courts in Paris and they’re all drenched because of the rain.

But she has recently been adding these precise drop shots to her game that have made her much more well rounded. Minnen just can’t keep up. Share 11m ago 05.51 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-1 Rybakina* (denotes server) Wow! Great effort from Minnen. Rybakina hits her shots all over the court but the Belgian twists her body and manages to return every single ball, her last backhand flying over Rybakina to the baseline. But Rybakina is keeping her at bay and only allows her opponent to briefly get her hopes up before a few flying aces to take the first game of the second set. Share 16m ago 05.46 EDT Rybakina takes the first set 6-2 Minnen isn’t down and out yet as her varied shots finally get the better of Rybakina. The crowd cheers her on as the underdog but the latter brings out a beautiful drop shot and after a couple of powerful forehands, she wraps up the set in dominant fashion. Think the world No 4 just needed a couple of extra minutes to warm up after those six unforced errors in a row. View image in fullscreen Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan hits a backhand.

Share Updated at 05.33 EDT 32m ago 05.30 EDT Minnen 2-3 Rybakina* (*denotes server) A couple of quick aces wrap up this game incredibly quickly.

A short rally ends in Rybakina netting a volley, but she gains the advantage after taking advantage of Minnen’s poor positioning. It is a break back and we’re all tied. Share 38m ago 05.23 EDT Minnen 2-1 Rybakina* (*denotes server) Rybakina is on the board! She finishes it quick after returning back to back serves with incredible pace.

        "content": "The police in Gujarat’s Bharuch caught a mentally unstable man on Monday evening after he allegedly attacked a group of Jain women monks earlier in the day. The man is currently undergoing treatment at the Bharuch civil hospital and the police said the monks are stable. As per details, six Jain monks left their religious place at Shrimali pole and were walking towards their Upashray (a place for monks to stay) at Dharol when an unknown man started following them. A police officer said, “When the monks asked him not to follow them, the man came closer and an argument ensued. Soon, he removed his belt and started attacking the monks.” Advertisement Satish Rathod, a vegetable merchant by profession who was passing by, tried to stop the man. When two others known to Satish intervened, the attacker escaped, the officer said. Rathod then escorted the monks to the Dharol Upashray and subsequently, Hemant Shah, a resident of Vidhya Vihar society, lodged a complaint against an unknown person at the Bharuch taluka police station on Monday afternoon. The police registered an offence under IPC Act Sections, 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506(2) (If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 341 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (Assault of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 (d) (Stalking) and 295(a) (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious feelings). Later, the police caught the suspect and identified him as Altaf Hussain Shaikh, 44, a resident of Kabootar Khana area in Bharuch and a native of Khambhat. Sensing him to be mentally unstable, the police took him to the Bharuch civil hospital. Advertisement Talking to The Indian Express , Bharuch taluka police inspector P D Jhankat said, “The accused is mentally unstable and undergoing treatment at the hospital. Once he is fine and the doctor gives a declaration about the same, we will arrest him.” Jhankat added, “The accused has been living with his elder brother in Bharuch for the last six months. His brother told us that he is mentally unstable and also showed us a file to prove his medical treatment history. We have also come to know that after his wife left him, he started creating troubles for his mother at his native place so his elder brother brought him to Bharuch.”",

        "content": "On May 28, Samsung Electronics has revealed an agreement with Lennox (NYSE: LII), a prominent provider of HVACR industry climate solutions, to establish a joint venture aimed at selling ductless HVAC systems across the United States and Canada. As the requirements for ducted and ductless systems evolve and converge, providing both options to customers creates greater synergies. This collaboration merges Samsung, known globally for 40 years of HVAC innovation, with Lennox, a leading North American HVAC OEM and distributor, to deliver top-tier heating and cooling solutions. Samsung will hold 50.1% of the new entity, Samsung Lennox HVAC North America, while Lennox will possess the remaining 49.9%. “It is a great pleasure to take the first step in creating a long-term HVAC industry-leading partnership with Lennox,” said KS Choi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics America. “Our collaboration, focused on strong product offerings and customer networks in the growing ductless segment, will bring new solutions to the market. We look forward to launching innovative technologies together in the future.” The joint venture will market Samsung's ductless products in the U.S. and Canada, as well as \"Lennox powered by Samsung\" products, available through Lennox stores and their direct-dealer network. Additionally, Samsung-branded products will continue to be supplied to existing Samsung HVAC distributors and representatives in these regions. Samsung anticipates that this venture will bolster their presence in the North American HVAC market by leveraging Lennox’s established distribution channels. Concurrently, Lennox aims to enhance its business by incorporating Samsung’s innovative ductless systems into its product lineup. This partnership will enable Samsung to integrate its expertise in artificial intelligence, software, smartphones, and semiconductors to offer enhanced smart home services via Samsung SmartThings, facilitating easy device connection and control for a smarter, more seamless lifestyle. SmartThings Energy allows users to monitor household power consumption, with AI Energy Mode assisting in reducing energy use of connected appliances. By bringing together their innovative products and expanding their distribution reach, Samsung Lennox HVAC North America aspires to fortify its residential and homebuilder business across North America. In addition, Samsung and Lennox will seek further partnership and collaboration opportunities with homebuilders in various product categories from home appliances to televisions and device parts and technology. “This joint venture represents the union of two outstanding brands with strong market positions and deep customer trust. It is an honor to work with Samsung as we invest in solutions to meet our customers' HVAC needs,” said Alok Maskara, Lennox Chief Executive Officer. “I am excited about the future of this joint venture as part of our growth strategy.” Subject to customary closing conditions, the joint venture is anticipated to begin operations in the second half of 2024. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for the joint venture will be appointed by Samsung and Lennox, with the headquarters based in Roanoke, Texas.",

        "description": "According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios",
        "content": "By PTI Comments READ LATER Minority shareholders are expected to benefit from the demerger of ITC 's hotel business into a separate entity, ITC Hotels, as it may unlock value for them, and improve return ratios of the FMCG major, as per reports of four proxy advisory firms. The reports from proxy advisory firms, including InGovern Research Services, ISS and SES, come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal. According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios. \"The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements. \"It can attract the right set of investors, strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry,\" ISS said in its report. Last year in August, ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soon-to-be-listed hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company. Highlighting the benefit of demerger, another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated, publicly traded hotel entity, becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business. This move aligns with ITC's corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers, ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector, and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future, it said. \"Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies, we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement,\" it said. Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC, is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger. Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme. However, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has suggested shareholders of ITC Ltd to vote against the proposed demerger of the hotel business on the grounds that it does not provide complete value unlocking for shareholders.

The 26-year-old finished seven seconds ahead of second-placed Oscar Piastri, with Leclerc narrowing the gap at the top of the standings.

Leclerc, who spends a lot of his spare time playing the piano, is a published musician, with his discography including three songs titled AUS23, MIA23, and MON23 - the abbreviations for the Australian, Miami and Monaco GPs.

        "content": "Friends and family members wave HMS Duncan off at Portsmouth (Image: Royal Navy) Royal Navy warship HMS Duncan is heading for the Red Sea where it will offer protection for UK ships as they travel along hazardous shipping lanes. The Type 45 destroyer, which set sail from Portsmouth today, will relieve sister ship HMS Diamond, which has shielding vessels from Houthi attacks since before Christmas. Like Diamond, HMS Duncan is armed with the Sea Viper missile system and equipped with the same radar systems, enabling it to detect threats from long distances. Commanding Officer, Commander Dan Lee, said: “I am immensely proud of the work the ship’s company have done to ready HMS Duncan for this important deployment. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) “HMS Duncan will be ready to deliver on operations around the clock as we join efforts to protect trade routes from Houthi attacks, continuing the excellent work of HMS Diamond and HMS Richmond in the region.\" HMS Duncan is equipped with the Sea Viper missile system (Image: AFP/Getty Images) READ MORE: 'Houthis launch fresh attack' in the Red Sea as oil tanker 'struck by missile' He added: “We have spent the past week readying the ship and saying our farewells to our families and loved ones who turned out to wave us off from Round Tower in Portsmouth. “It is a privilege to serve on the Royal Navy’s ‘last and best’ Type 45 destroyer and I have every confidence that the ship and our people will succeed on operations and support stability where tasked.” During the course of her deployment, HMS Diamond shot down nine drones and one missile, launched by Houthis from the coast of Yemen at cargo ships. HMS Duncan’s 200 men and women have worked to ensure that their ship is ready to deploy, successfully completing trials and training last week in preparation for the deployment, which will see the ship work to ensure freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for merchant vessels.

Read our Privacy Policy HMS Duncan spent five months leading NATO’s premier task group in the Mediterranean Sea last year, prior to handing over flagship duties to the Italian Navy in December. The ship is now ready for more operations, with more than 60 new members joining the ship’s company. A missile splashed down in the waters of the Red Sea last Thursday (May 24), but caused no damage to a passing commercial vessel. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, although it can take hours or even days for them to acknowledge their assaults. Trending The attack happened in the southern Red Sea near the crucial Bab el-Mandeb Strait, theUnited Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations Centre said. The private security firm Ambrey similarly reported the attack. The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the United States Maritime Administration. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.

        "content": "Bengaluru: Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday indicated that the next procedure to bring back Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of sexually abusing several women, from abroad will commence if he does not turn up on May 31. His statement comes a day after Prajwal released a video statement that he will appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and cooperate with the inquiry. “We have taken all efforts within the country to bring Prajwal back. We have written to the central government, we have obtained a warrant against him, which we have informed the Ministry of Home and External Affairs. Also, a Blue Corner Notice has been issued. In the meantime, he released a video message about his return,” Parameshwara told reporters. Prajwal’s decision to come back is appropriate as no one can escape from the clutches of law, he said. “It is said that his membership will expire if he loses the election, and his diplomatic passport will also be impounded. Considering all this he might have decided to come back.” Once Prajwal returns, the legal process would begin, he said, “I don’t know what prompted him to release that video... We will see what happens on May 31. If he doesn’t turn up, the next procedure will start.” To a question, would Prajwal be arrested at the immigration centre when he lands here, Parameshwara said, SIT will decide it. “There is already a Blue Corner Notice, arrest warrant, notices have been served asking him to appear before SIT. A chargesheet and other things will be done later. Now we have to find out the truth,” he said, replying to a question if he will be arrested upon surrender. Asked about Prajwal’s allegation that Congress conspired against him, the Home Minister said, “Let’s see all those things. SIT will consider all those things.” Prajwal (33), the grandson of JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda and the NDA candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing women. He reportedly left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls, and is still at large. A ‘Blue Corner Notice’ seeking information on his whereabouts has already been issued by Interpol, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant on May 18 against Prajwal Revanna, following an application moved by the SIT. To a question on BJP’s protest against alleged rise in murders in the state and brand Bengaluru taking a hit, the Minister said, “protesting is their right, we are not saying that they should not protest. We will respond to it at the appropriate time.” Claiming that the law and order situation in Karnataka was good, he said, “murders have been reported unfortunately... They should not have happened. I will also release the data on the crime rate and number of murders that took place when BJP was in power. Also, drug cases during their time.”",

        "description": "Cape Town Spurs CEO Alexi Efstathiou has explained why one of his most-wanted youngsters, Luke Baartman, did not feature in the last match of the season against Kaizer Chiefs.",
        "content": "Spurs's 2-0 home win over Amakhosi saw the sleeping giant finishing outside the Top Eight in the DStv Premiership log table, marking an end to what has been the visitors' worst season in the PSL era. The absence of \"Boere\", as the talented Baartman is fondly known in football circles, caught the eye. This was more so because the last time the two sides had met, in November 2023 at FNB Stadium, Baartman came from the bench to score a stunning goal past Itumeleng Khune. The youngster is one of the players that form part of the Chiefs faithful's wish-list ahead of what is hoped to be a much improved season for the Soweto giants, hence the question marks regarding his absence from the team sheet on Saturday. The highly-rated 17-year-old made 10 appearances for the Urban Warriors in all competitions, and saw a return of league goals in what was a challenging season for the Urban Warriors. Speaking to , Efstathiou explained why the teenage sensation could not take part in the exciting encounter. \"The reason he was not part of the team that played against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday is because he is writing exams, he is in Matric,\" Efstathiou revealed. Nevertheless, the likes of Asanele Velebayi and Ashley Cupido gave a five-star performance at DHL Stadium to heap more misery on Cavin Johnson's men, who would have been pleased to hear the sound of the final whistle as it marked the end of a season to forget for them. As for Baartman and a couple of his teammates who have been linked with moves away from Spurs, it remains to be seen if they will be wearing new colours in the new campaign.",

        "content": "A woman has confessed to eating her grandmother's ashes in a bid to cheer her grieving mum up following her death. Cheyenne, from the city of Narre Warren in Australia , shared how she put her nan's cremated remains in a bowl so she could consume them. Since then, she has encouraged her mother to join in and sprinkled them on her brother's pasta on another occasion. However, her sibling seemed to be unaware of what she had done. Despite the controversial decision, Cheyenne believes her grandparents will live on in her \"forever\" after using her as a garnish. She said her mother didn't seem to mind the suggestion because it was \"just for fun.\" She revealed her bizarre actions after calling into Fox's Melbourne breakfast show during their 'Cashfessional' segment. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Host Fifi Box was left stunned when a caller admitting to consuming her nan's ashes ( Image: Fox) But hosts Fifi, Fev & Nick were left speechless after they asked Cheyenne what her confession was. \"I ate my Nan,\" she said. \"My Nan passed away in August last year and got cremated. My family and I were grieving, so we went over to Mum's one night and we thought to cheer her up again... let's eat Nan.\" All three presenters gasped in shock following the unexpected outburst, which led the grandaughter to further explain her actions. \"After I did it once, I got Mum to do it because I didn't want to be alone in it. But that's not the only part of the story... this is the part I've told nobody. My brother got out of jail not too long ago,\" she added. The hosts were left in 'shock' by the confession ( Image: Fox) Fev, 43, interrupted and said \"Oh God\" before Cheyenne explained that she wanted to prank her brother who was finally out of jail. \"I put some of Nan's ashes in the pasta sauce,\" she giggled. Co-host Fifi Box, 47, said she was trying to wrap her head around the concept before she asked: \"This is so much for me. I'm taking this on board. Have you stopped eating her?\" In response, Cheyanne said: \"I'll say yes for your sake, Fifi. I eat her just for fun. Nan will live on through me forever.\" Fev rounded up the conversation and commented: \"I'm a little bit shocked. I don't get shocked too often.\"",

The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 7.34% during the forecast period. For more insights on the forecast market size and historic data (2018 - 2022) - The global home decor market is experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for eco-friendly furniture and interiors. This trend is driven by both consumer preference and environmental regulations. The health concerns associated with traditional furniture, which emits harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are also fueling this demand. As a result, there is a strong focus on sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood, rubberwood, bamboo, rattan, and wicker. Popular furniture companies are responding to this trend by offering certified and salvaged products, contributing to the expansion of the eco-friendly office furniture market. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 8.5 million tonnes of office furniture are disposed of annually, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. The home decor market is currently experiencing a surge in trends, with smart technology leading the way. Devices such as voice assistants, urban planning, and bedrooms are being integrated with technology for convenience and efficiency. Carpets and consoles are popular decor choices, with consumers seeking rugs and room dividers that add style and function to their spaces. Bedrooms are a focus area, with consumers looking for comfortable and stylish bedding and storage solutions. Prefabricated and consumer-friendly home decor solutions are also gaining traction, offering affordability and ease of installation. Overall, the home decor market is seeing a shift towards practicality, convenience, and technology integration. Research report provides comprehensive data on impact of trend, driver and challenges - The furniture sector in the global home decor market experiences continuous growth due to consumers' desire for functional and stylish home solutions. This category encompasses products like sofas, chairs, tables, beds, and storage units, with designs ranging from traditional to modern. The preference for wooden furniture among middle- and high-income demographics fuels this growth, driven by its superior quality and aesthetic value. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of modular kitchens and closets, as well as eco-friendly materials, broadens the market scope. Ashley Global Retail LLC, a leading American manufacturer and retailer, offers a diverse range of home furnishings, including the Signature Design by Ashley sofa collections, the Bolanburg dining room set, and the Porter bedroom series, catering to various preferences. Consequently, the increasing demand for furniture products will propel the furniture segment's expansion in the home decor market during the forecast period.

        "content": "A mum with bleeding so heavy she got through 30 pads a day - costing £600-a-year - discovered it's because she has two uteruses. Jade Williams, 31, began getting heavy periods after the birth of her first child, Elouise, in November 2012, when she was 19. They grew heavier and heavier over the years but doctors didn't know why. Even after having three more children - Ajay, seven, Maisie, five, and Sienna, four - Jade's bleeding persisted and doctors struggled to pinpoint the reason. They tried her on various medication but nothing worked and the bleeding became so intense she would have to wear nappy-sized period pads and two pairs of trousers to avoid leaks. She would get through 30 pads a day - costing her around £600-a-year - and would bloat so much she was \"bigger than during pregnancy \". Eventually in late 2023 she switched to a different hospital and demanded answers. An exploratory surgery revealed an unexpected outcome - she was bleeding from two uteruses. Despite having been through four pregnancies and countless scans, the rare condition - known as uterus didelphys - had been missed. Skincare expert warns people not to 'waste money' on latest anti-ageing trend Jade at hospital ( Image: Jade Williams/SWNS) Jade has had an IUS coil fitted since then and the bleeding has been significantly reduced, meaning she can go about her daily life again without worry for the first time in years. Jade, a McDonalds manager, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: \"I had always had heavy bleeding after my first daughter. \"I could barely leave the house - I was wearing underwear, pads, leggings, trousers, and then I'd still have to go home and change. Doctors gave me pills but nothing would help and I would bloat so much I would be bigger than when I was pregnant. They told me it would stop on its own, and not to worry - but of course I did worry. \"When I found out I was bleeding so much because I have two uteruses I couldn't believe it. They said I was one-in-a-million. Since the bleeding has been under control I have been able to go back to work - and I'll be able to wear shorts and dresses for the first time this summer. But this condition ruined my life for ten years - and we need more research into it.\" Jade began bleeding after her first pregnancy and never stopped - with it getting heavier over time. She didn't even stop bleeding during her next three pregnancies and it would be accompanied by horrible cramps. She said she was \"constantly in touch with the hospital and GP\" and was prescribed medications, but said nothing helped. It affected every aspect of her life - with her needing to cancel plans, take time off work and change clothes several times a day no matter how much sanitary protection she wore. Her sex life struggled as she had to double up on underwear instead of sporting lingerie and the bed \"would look like a crime scene after\". Jade with partner Anthony Nunn ( Image: Tony Kershaw/SWNS) After a decade with no idea what was causing it, Jade - who is engaged to Anthony Nunn, 41 - put her foot down and demanded answers. She even moved to a different hospital in the hope it would be taken seriously. She said: \"I said 'I can't keep living like this' - I needed two pads and two pairs of trousers at a time. I knew it wasn't normal and it wasn't going away.\" In October 2023 she went in for a scan and was called in for an emergency biopsy shortly after. Jade had needed treatment to have cancer cells removed from her cervix directly after her first pregnancy over a decade earlier. After seeing her scan, doctors revealed the bleeding wasn't due to endometriosis, as she had suspected - so Jade became increasingly worried the cancer was still present. After further biopsies and an exploratory surgery the following month, Jade was told she was cancer-free after all. But doctors went on to tell her the reason her bleeding was so heavy - is because she was bleeding from two uteruses fused together. She said: \"They said it was one-in-a-million. They said the condition causes pre-term labour, and all my babies were early so that makes sense.\" The doctors also removed nine uterine polyps during the procedure. Medics were unsure why, but after the surgery, her second uterus started to fail - and eventually blocked off. So after having a Merina coil inserted into her one remaining functional uterus, her bleeding has slowed to a spotting and become manageable. She said: \"My situation is a lot better now. Before, I was constantly using heat pads and getting through 30 sanitary towels a day - it was so bad. In summer I'd need to wear a jacket in case I needed to tie it around my waist - people would ask 'are you hot? and I'd say 'yes!'. \"Now I can go swimming with my kids - whenever they asked before, I would have to say no. Finally I know the reason why and I can have more of a normal life. But there's not much awareness and I still never really got answers. I want more women to be aware of it and I want there to be more information out there.\"",

        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway are moving to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, a step toward a long-held Palestinian aspiration that was fueled by international outrage over the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip following Israel’s offensive. The joint decision by two European Union countries plus Norway, a nation with a strong diplomatic tradition in peacemaking, may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israel’s isolation. Previously seven member of the 27-nation European Union officially recognized a Palestinian state. Five of them are former east bloc countries who announced recognition in 1988, as did Cyprus, before joining the bloc. Sweden's recognition came in 2014. The Czech Republic, an EU member, says that the 1988 recognition by the former Czechoslovakia — of which it then formed a part — does not apply to the modern state. Slovakia's Foreign Ministry says that the two sides confirmed their mutual recognition when Slovakia was becoming independent in 1992-93, and that the Palestinian state has a fully functioning embassy in Bratislava since 2006. EU members Malta and Slovenia say they may follow suit, though not immediately. Some 140 of the about 190 countries represented in the U.N. have already recognized a Palestinian state. Here’s a look at how and why the new European announcements could be important: A U.N. partition plan in 1947 called for the creation of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state, but Palestinians and the wider Arab world rejected it because it would have given them less than half of the land even though Palestinians made up two-thirds of the population. The Arab-Israeli war the following year left Israel with even more territory, Jordan in control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of Gaza. In the 1967 war, Israel seized all three territories, and decades of on-again, off-again peace talks have failed. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel as a solution to the Middle East’s most intractable conflict, but they insist Palestinian statehood should come as part of a negotiated settlement. There have been no substantive negotiations since 2009. Though the EU countries and Norway won’t be recognizing an existing state, just the possibility of one, the symbolism helps enhance the Palestinians’ international standing and heaps more pressure on Israel to open negotiations on ending the war. Also, the move lends additional prominence to the Middle East issue ahead of June 6-9 elections to the European Parliament . Diplomatic pressure on Israel has grown as the battle with Hamas stretches into its eighth month. The U.N. General Assembly voted by a significant margin on May 11 to grant new “rights and privileges” to Palestine in a sign of growing international support for a vote on full voting membership. The Palestinian Authority currently has observer status. The leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia said in March they were considering recognizing a Palestinian state as “a positive contribution” toward ending the war. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that his Cabinet would certify the formal recognition after a meeting Tuesday. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez said. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make. Even so, their recognition would mark a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Little would likely change on the ground in the short term. Peace talks are stalled, and Israel’s hardline government has dug its heels in against Palestinian statehood. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Israel, which rejects any move to legitimize the Palestinians internationally, recalled its ambassadors to Ireland, Norway and Spain after they announced the decision last week. Steps like the ones by the three European countries will harden the Palestinian position and undermine the negotiating process, Israel says, insisting that all issues should be solved through negotiations. Israel often responds to foreign countries’ decisions deemed as going against its interests by summoning those countries’ ambassadors and also punishing the Palestinians through measures such as freezing tax transfers to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority. Some 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian, more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership. Some major powers have indicated their stance may be evolving amid the outcry over the consequences of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between noncombatants and fighters in its count. Israel launched the offensive following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Britain has said no recognition of a Palestinian state could come while Hamas remains in Gaza, but that it could happen while Israeli negotiations with Palestinian leaders were in progress. France has indicated that it isn’t ready to join other countries in recognizing a Palestinian state, even if it isn’t opposed to the idea in principle. German has said it will not recognize a Palestinian state for the time being. Follow AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

        "content": "Earlier in an interview with Bombay Times actress Esha Gupta spoke how her partner Manuel Campos Guallar, (Spanish-entrepreneur) helped her set her business. The actress who is in Madrid right now has finally set her business and started a restaurant chain. “It’s an achievement that I’m really proud of myself to be honest. Building something from the start and seeing it turn into a reality,” she tells us exclusively. “Madrid is second home to me, it only seemed right to jump into this partnership when the opportunity arose,” Gupta adds. Ask the actress what prompted her to kick start her own restaurant, and she mentions, “I’ve been cribbing about Spain not having enough vegetarian options at good places, and when we were coming with the concept, the main priority was great veg options which everyone enjoys unexpectedly. Apart from the amazing food, it’s a more bespoke kinda place in the most famous neighbourhood of Madrid.” The actress who was last seen in , is enjoying being an entrepreneur , however, she also busts the myth that one should not come under pressure to become an entrepreneur. “Don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think we should put this pressure on anyone and compare. I became an actor by chance and gods will, but business is what I’m building. I think everyone should do what they feel is right for them. I’ve always had a “baniya buddhi” like they say. But being a mom and taking care of your family is more tiresome, so I would say women should do as it pleases them, without the expectations of the society, but be respected in everything they do.” Currently, she is happy in “life and with the people” she has. “I am satisfied, not so much as there is so much more to do, whether it’s personal growth or professional. I am just starting. Keeping my focus on other things which are in the pipeline,” she signs off.",

Gardening enthusiasts are facing the annual battle with weeds , despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions, reports the Express . One individual took to Reddit to highlight the extent of their weed problem as they asked for advice on their weed issues - with pathways and gravel areas overrun. They said: \"How to get rid of weeds in between the stones of my pathway and gravel road?\" Fellow green-fingered folk have been quick to offer their two pence on the matter. One person suggested: \"I used a weed torch to get weeds that pop up along our driveway and brick patio. It is quick and you don't need to spray chemicals.\" Another chimed in with: \"Landscaped for a good while. Weed torch is fun but is routine. I would pour boiling salt water all over those weeds.\" A third advised: \"Near boiling water, string Weeder, flame weeding.\" Someone else recommended a mix of \"white vinegar 1/3 pail of hot water.\" And another shared their extensive experience, writing: \"I have five aces, which includes a couple of paved areas and a long gravel driveway. I have tried the propane torch, salt, pulling manually, and vinegar. None of these methods have worked beyond a month and they all took a long time to complete.\" They continued: \"I'm at the point where I'm about to embrace the growth and plant some sort of moss between the pavers (I've read you can blend moss into a slurry and pour it between the cracks to grow -I have yet to try it). I'm not sure about the gravel driveway though.\" One more added their technique: \"Scuffle hoe for the pea gravel, it's way faster than anything else. For the little bricks, boiling water or a torch.\" What's your secret to a weed-free garden? Drop us a line in the comments below.

        "content": "Hannah Kamke wanted medical care—she wanted to confirm whether she was pregnant, and if so, she wanted to terminate. Instead, she stumbled onto a crisis pregnancy center that she claims lied to her about her pregnancy status and later slapped her with a lawsuit accusing of domestic terrorism. Today, CompassCare, an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center,” is trying to weaponize a pro-choice law known as the FACE Act against Kamke in federal court while publicly disparaging her as a violent and dangerous extremist. Kamke is fighting back, accusing the clinic of misconduct and demanding damages of her own. The high-stakes battle points toward a new stage in the effort to hold fraudulent anti-abortion clinics accountable, and in the clinics’ own attempts to evade liability through smear tactics and legal hardball—against their own patients when necessary. Kamke’s story, as relayed to me in an interview and documented in legal filings, is sadly familiar. She sought assistance because she popped positive on multiple pregnancy tests but also had her period; due to a medical condition, she believed she could not conceive but wanted a medical professional’s confirmation. Googling abortion clinics, Kamke came across CompassCare, which purported to offer health care services to women with unplanned pregnancies. When she called, the woman on the phone refused to say whether the clinic offered abortions but encouraged her to come in for a pregnancy test and an ultrasound. What happened next still haunts her. Upon arrival, the staff instructed her to urinate in a cup then wait in an exam room. A nurse entered, and Kamke told her that if she was pregnant, she intended to have an abortion. The nurse allegedly responded that “God needs every child to be born,” adding that Kamke “was put on this earth” to become a mother. According to Kamke, the nurse also stated that individuals who obtained abortions were more likely to be sexually promiscuous and, therefore, more likely to get STIs. After the nurse got the result of the pregnancy test, which appeared to be the same type of regular stick you could get from the drugstore, she allegedly told Kamke that it came back negative. But according to Kamke, the nurse asked about her “sexual history.” She encouraged Kamke to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, and CompassCare gave her paperwork promising that a physician would oversee the procedure. Kamke—confused and distraught by this point—agreed. But a physician was not involved in the ultrasound; instead, the nurse conducted it. CompassCare would later produce Kamke’s medical records to her criminal attorneys—but the records did not make any mention of the performance of this ultrasound. The nurse declared that the ultrasound showed no proof of pregnancy. But just before Kamke intended to leave, a staff member allegedly rushed in and excitedly announced, falsely, that a “miracle” had occurred: The test had changed and now showed that Kamke was pregnant. (Medical records from the visit show that she was clearly never pregnant.) It is unclear whether this misdiagnosis might have been the product of sheer negligence or a fraudulent excuse to further evangelize Kamke against abortion. Either way, recognizing that she was not receiving legitimate care, Kamke said she walked out, violated and betrayed by her mistreatment. Fifteen months later, Kamke was still angry. As she told me, “I was mad at CompassCare and felt like they had set me into a trajectory of anger that didn’t need to exist. I was mad that these people are able to do what they do under the guise of health care when they provided no health care.” So, one night, she spray-painted the word “LIARS” on CompassCare’s sign. The clinic removed the graffiti within hours—and immediately pressed criminal charges, falsely accusing her of an affiliation with the radical pro-choice group Jane’s Revenge. Local police obtained a search warrant and raided her home. Kamke confessed to the act and eventually pleaded guilty in Amherst Town Court to a single charge of disorderly conduct, paying CompassCare $2,580 in restitution. She thought that would be the end of it. It was not. In October 2023, CompassCare brought a federal against Kamke, falsely tying to her to an “extremist group” and accusing her of participating in “a wave of violence against pro-life pregnancy centers.” The clinic alleged that, by graffitiing its sign, Kamke had violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act. Congress this law in 1994 to protect abortion clinics from escalating violence, including the assassination of doctors and blockade of patients seeking care. Local authorities, especially in conservative areas, could not always be relied upon to prosecute these cases. The statute applies to anyone who, “by force or threat of force,” intentionally “intimidates or interferes” with a facility providing “reproductive health services,” as well as anyone who “intentionally damages or destroys the property” of such a facility, because it provides those services. Though typically invoked in criminal charges, the FACE Act also imposes civil liability on offenders. CompassCare accuses Kamke of a civil violation and demands monetary damages. In response, Kamke argues that CompassCare has no right to invoke the FACE Act because it “does not provide” reproductive health services but rather attempts to trick women out of receiving such services. She also asserts that she did not graffiti the clinic’s sign it provides reproductive health services, as the FACE Act requires, but because it doesn’t. Kamke—now represented by the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine—volleyed her own allegations at CompassCare . She of violating New York law by engaging in malpractice and negligence. The clinic, she alleged, refuses to tell patients whether it performs abortions until they have already been ensnared in its “care”—at which point it subjects them to evangelical coercion and pseudoscientific malpractice. She said it fails to provide informed consent for invasive services like the transvaginal ultrasound and lies about who will perform them. This blizzard of malpractice and misinformation, Kamke alleges, amounts to serious fraud against patients, subjecting them to “harm and trauma.” CompassCare has responded by furiously Kamke in public, an unusual way to treat a former patient. Rather than denying her allegations outright, the clinic a First Amendment right to lie to patients by falsely telling them a pregnancy test turned positive because of a “miracle.” (CompassCare and its attorney did not respond to Slate’s requests for comment.) But Kamke’s counterclaim is not the only legal trouble the organization faces: New York Attorney Tish James recently filed against CompassCare, along with other crisis pregnancy centers, accusing them of illegal and deceptive business practices for advertising “abortion pill reversal,” or the ability to halt a medication abortion after it has begun. Legitimate medical groups this practice to be dangerous, unethical, and ineffective; James charges CompassCare with unlawfully advertising and performing it as an “experimental medical treatment” on vulnerable women. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has a similar suit against Heartbeat International, which runs a sprawling network of crisis pregnancy centers. James, Bonta, and Kamke’s lawsuits are part of a new approach to holding crisis pregnancy centers to account for misleading and mistreating women. For a while, blue states like California tried to limit the centers’ deceptive practices by mandating disclosures—like informing patients that they lack a license to provide medical services. But the Supreme Court blocked this approach in 2018, , in effect, that anti-abortion groups have a First Amendment right to mislead potential patients. Four conservative justices accused California of borrowing a tactic from “authoritarian regimes.” Since then, both victims and pro-choice advocates have shifted toward the civil justice system for solutions. Suing specific crisis pregnancy centers for mistreating patients is not a swift or perfect solution; a statewide law like California’s would curb the clinics’ deception more efficiently. Litigation, though, has its own benefits: It shows courts the precise harms inflicted by the clinics’ lies and allows a jury—drawn from the very community targeted by the clinics—to hear the facts and impose civil liability if they’re proved. A woman in Massachusetts, for instance, is currently the crisis pregnancy center Clearway Clinic. The plaintiff alleges that the clinic failed to identify her ectopic pregnancy during an ultrasound, then encouraged her to continue the pregnancy; this oversight could have literally killed her. She’s certainly not the first person whose life has been endangered in this exact way: Although crisis pregnancy centers rarely admit it, the ultrasounds they offer designed to thwart abortions rather than identify potential complications. Any patient with an ectopic pregnancy risks death by amateur misdiagnosis. Anti-abortion organizations accuse all these plaintiffs of a vindictive political agenda. And the CEO of CompassCare, the Rev. James Harden, has relentlessly vilified Kamke, “humiliating and denigrating” her, in her lawyer’s words; Harden even announced on TV that he intended to hit her “in the pocketbook.” But Kamke isn’t chasing money, or retribution—just an end to this legal saga, and maybe some measure of closure. In conversation with Slate, she said she wanted some semblance of justice, however small, and a confirmation that she suffered a genuine wrong. Three years after her appointment at CompassCare, she remains rattled by the experience. “What do I really want? I want my life back,” she told me. “I want these people to no longer have control of my",

        "description": "On Monday the Ukrainian President successfully secured a Spanish pledge for additional air defence missiles.",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has picked up a second promise of military aid worth one billion euros in as many days for the war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Mr Zelensky sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that cause wide destruction. A day earlier, Mr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates one billion euros of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and five billion euros by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the EU is again struggling to overcome Hungary’s objections to the 27-nation bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia’s staunchest ally in the EU. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine’s defence efforts. Mr Zelensky met Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Mr Zelensky has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting wher EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built “in a short time frame”. The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. “Ukraine is also fighting Europe’s fight,” she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose the swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. “We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,” said Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur. “The urgency is very, very acute.” Mr Zelensky was due to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force.",

        "description": "Chinese automobile manufacturer SAIC has announced plans to fit the electric vehicles from subsidiary IM Motors with solid-state batteries from 2027.",
        "content": "2027 will be an interesting year in terms of the introduction of solid-state batteries. After CATL, Toyota and Nissan, SAIC is now also positioning itself as a pioneer of this technology and is committing to a similar time horizon to bring solid-state batteries into series production. Several media reports on a new strategic plan came out a few days ago, according to which SAIC intends to complete its first production line for solid-state batteries next year and start series production the following year. The first IM Motors brand models with solid-state batteries on board are planned for 2027. The energy density will then be over 400 Wh/kg, according to reports. Lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes currently reach their limit at around 350 Wh/kg. In a first step, SAIC plans to equip with semi-solid-state batteries this year, which, according to the manufacturer, will achieve an energy density of over 300 Wh/kg. The semi-solid-state batteries will also be used in other SAIC brands from 2025. China’s largest state-owned car manufacturer is keeping a low profile when it comes to further details. When it comes to solid-state batteries, SAIC merely states that the new battery technology will increase the safety of the batteries and that the production costs of solid-state batteries will be around 40 per cent lower than those of batteries with liquid electrolyte. SAIC’s battery strategy is embedded in a broader innovation approach that also focuses on digitalisation in the vehicle. The Chinese company is also expanding its cooperation network: For example, the state-owned car manufacturer recently signed a contract with Audi to jointly develop electric cars. The is due to be launched on the market in 2025. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese business newspaper revealed that a number of major Chinese battery and car manufacturers had formed an alliance to jointly drive forward the commercialisation of solid-state batteries. The Chinese government is said to be the initiator of the alliance. The consortium called China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP) was founded in January with the aim of developing and producing competitive solid-state batteries and establishing a supply chain by 2030. According to , CATL, CALB, EVE Energy, SVOLT, and BYD’s battery subsidiary FinDreams Battery are involved in the alliance. There are also several state-owned manufacturers from the automotive industry as well as the private companies BYD and Nio. Other players include representatives from the government and academia. According to the Japanese newspaper, ‘influential state-sponsored funds are also on the CASIP membership list’. It is unclear whether SAIC is one of the state-owned manufacturers involved. The car manufacturer was not explicitly named when the plans were announced in February. The alliance demonstrates that China will not allow its market-leading position in electric car batteries to be overtaken by a technological leap towards solid-state batteries. Against this backdrop, the new consortium will primarily focus on basic research, key technologies, the joint development and production of electric vehicles with solid-state batteries and the establishment of a corresponding supply chain. A member, CATL has now announced its intention to produce pure solid-state batteries in small quantities for the first time . With regard to the alliance, it should be emphasised that the project coordinated from Beijing brings together competitors who are sometimes aggressively fighting for market share. One example cited by is the fact that CATL has sued its competitors CALB and Svolt for patent infringement. Together, the Chinese rivals are bringing together the initiatives launched in South Korea, Japan, North America and Europe to commercialise solid-state battery technology, which could outpace the Chinese industry. Toyota, for example, wants to launch the , while . , ,",

        "description": "@nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",
        "content": "@Th3solution You know, I hadn't even noticed it hadn't been continuing. I did like the Platinum line from the early days, but the red banner of Greatest Hits titles I found rather ugly. Anyway, could it be something to do with most games being sold through digital storefronts now, and continual sales? I'm ashamed to admit, but I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at games in a physical store. Even having said that, they could do a section in the digital store announcing a line that hits a certain sales threshold (and if you notice, some games do get stealth permanent price drops), thereby getting a lower price and becoming platinum or whatever. There's a lot they could do to improve the store, I feel. @BAMozzy The Greatest Hits program was never exclusive to first party games. In fact the majority of games on it were third party. Stuff like Battlefield, Crash Bandicoot, Battlefront, Monster Hunter, Metal Gear Solid, LEGO, Resident Evil, and Yakuza games, to name a few from the PS4 gen GH collection. For first party, I agree it becomes a little sticky when a game is cross gen, but some of them are sold as a package with both PS4/PS5 versions included. I also agree that the PC releases also complicate things because they seem to be releasing around the timeframe that a game would be considered a “greatest hit”. Remakes shouldn’t be a problem though since it didn’t stop them before (The Last of Us Remastered is a Greatest Hit on PS4, as is The Nathan Drake Collection) Still, at this point I think it would easily make sense to consider games like Demon’s Souls, Returnal, Horizon Forbidden West, R&C Rift Apart, GoW Ragnarok, SM1 & Miles Morales, UC Legacy of Thieves Collection; as well as 3rd party games like It Takes Two, Resident Evil 8, Yakuza Like a Dragon, No Man’s Sky, Hades, DMC5, Deathloop, GT7, AC Valhalla, FF7 Remake, Control, Stray... etc, etc. We’ve reached a point where there are enough games that have sold well and/or received accolades that they can be celebrated (and sold at a discount). Of course, I’ve always thought there was a weird inconsistency of which games get the special “Greatest Hits” moniker on their cover art. Games like Friday the 13th, Project CARS, and Plants vs Zombie: Garden Warfare 2 were included and yet hits like Shadow of the Colossus Remake, RDR2, and Detroit Become Human were not. Edit: As far as a GH collection cannibalizing the subscription service, I don’t think it would. PS+ subscription numbers have remained stagnant anyways. Some people would rather buy their games and I think the promotion of being a discounted GH would help sales. @Malaise The red “Greatest Hits” stripe still appears on the digital cover art, but it’s less noticeable than the red disc jacket of the physical versions. Like you say, the tradition could easily transfer over to the digital storefront, especially if the games are getting a price drop anyways. @Th3solution What I meant was that the main reason behind the 'Greatest Hits' maybe no longer relevant. The 'purpose' from the business perspective wasn't 'Customer' focussed but a way to have a secondary PR run to boost sales of an 'older' game that wasn't really selling anymore. Now they have PC and PS+ Sub services and the 'hype/PR' around those games releasing on PC or into a Sub service generates 'sales' on PS5. When Spider-Man came to PC, PS5 sales were also 'boosted' because of the PR. All I am saying is that Sony/Playstation is not the 'same' as it was when they weren't releasing games on PC to generate a second wave of 'sales' and if you missed their 'Greatest Hits', Subscribe to a higher tier to get to play them. If they were 'budget' price now on PS5, it devalues their Sub service and/or being able to sell the game at 'full' Price on PC. Essentially, that Sony are not in the same situation they were in, their 'market' has changed as they aren't solely relying on Game Sales on their Console as its now supplemented by PC and Subscription sales. Those still 'remind' people those games are all on Playstation too... @BAMozzy Perhaps that’s true. Either way, it’s unfortunate that the tradition has stopped after 5 generations. i used to keep my game cases back then and hated the greatest hits ugly red cover lol White DS5 that came with the console is on its way back to Sony due to developing a tendency to go left constantly. Almost a year to the day since having the console and what I can only describe as 'light' use - posted it back 3 days before its warranty expires so hopefully Sony will repair/replace the innards. I've still got 3 official DS3s and 4 DS4s - much more heavily used and no sign of drifting. @nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",

        "description": "Jake Last was goalkeeper for Burnley under 14s Academy and hoped for life as a professional footballer until his dreams were shattered after a hospital visit",
        "content": "A promising footballer has seen his life turned upside down after a twinge in his knee led to a devastating diagnosis. Two years ago Jake Last was playing in goal for Burnley under-14s Academy, earing the nickname of \"The Cat\" because he was so agile. The devoted Manchester United fan had hoped for life as a professional footballer - only for a heartbreaking diagnosis which has meant him having to rethink his future. For tests after he began to suffer with a sore knee revealed he had bone cancer. And while initially it looked like treatment was successful - with Jake even ringing the bell - the cancer has returned leaving the youngster having to have his right leg amputated with surgery set for next month. But, the now 15-year-old, from Chadderton , Oldham , is already hoping for a footballing future, potentially playing for the Manchester City or Everton amputee teams - and even England. His dad, John, 54, said: \"I don't think you will ever get Jake to not be involved in football. He is an amazing lad. He has been unbelievable. \"It is strange to say, but he lives as if he has never had the disease. The treatment (chemotherapy) has been brutal. But he knows it is having an effect on the cancer and helping get rid of it.\" Jake's determination has impressed both Manchester footballing halves - City and United. Kobbie Mainoo, the United star, who shone in last weekend's FA Cup Final, sent him a video message telling the teenager: \"Hi Jake, it's Kobbie. I'm sorry to hear everything you are going through. Stay strong and I hope everything goes well with the surgery.\" A friend of his family who is a City fan donated a framed, signed shirt worn by City goalkeeper Ederson, which was auctioned to raise money to help Jake's family through tough times. You can donate here. John told how the family's nightmare began when Jake said he had a twinge in his knee. He said: \"He was playing for Burnley under 14s and had suffered an ankle injury and was on crutches for six weeks. We thought the pain in his knee was just because he had been on crutches so long.\" Eventually Jake was taken to hospital for an X-ray. It was initially thought he had damaged his tendons - but further tests in March 2022 revealed it was Osteosarcoma - bone cancer. Jake had 16 weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital before having surgery at Birmingham to replace his knee, tibia and femur with titanium implants. The teenager had 14 more weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital to \"mop up\" any remaining cancerous cells. He rang the bell in May of last year, as there was no sign of the cancer, then underwent tough physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to help him to walk again. But last October a MRI scan found that the cancer had returned in his hip. John said: \"We were devastated as we really thought he had beat this horrible disease. So he started a different type of chemotherapy in February of this year, of which there are six sessions, he has one more to go which is from June 4 to June 9. \"He had an MRI scan after the second lot of chemotherapy and it was found that the chemotherapy was attacking the tumour and breaking it down. It also showed that there was a small cancerous tumour in his lung and a suspected tumour in his spine but the tumour in his lung had not grown since his first scan so that is good news\". Following a recent scan, the radiologist said his back problem is now not cancerous. He needs to have a final scan next month before undergoing surgery. John said: \"Jake has decided he will be more able bodied if they remove his right leg at the hip. The higher we go the less chance there is of the cancer returning. He had already said to the doctors after being diagnosed 'why don't you just take my leg off'. But they rightly said they had to try and save his limb. Now it has come back in his hip he struggles to walk without his crutches.\" Determined Jake had already started football training again before the cancer was discovered in his hip, this time playing for grassroots side, Droylsden . He was invited to watch the England amputee team play in Partington which was \"brilliant\". His dad added: \"Around here there are only Manchester City and Everton that have amputee teams. He can hopefully go training with one of them and one day get in the England set up.\" Chelsea Ashworth, who has set up a Gofundme page to fundraise for Jake's family, said: \"Jake is an absolute incredible inspiration and has endured so much over the last few years and still has a long road to recovery.\" Jake is the second child of John and his wife, Tracy. \"In 2007 we had a daughter, Olivia, who died shortly after her birth. Jake was born in 2008 and I guess the loss of Olivia was why he was born so soon after. He still talks of his sister - and I am sure if she was here she would be saying I'm right behind you,\" said John. You can make a donation here. So far £7,700 of a £10,000 target has been raised.",

        "description": "The Pope's behind-the-door remark has caused outrage, particularly because he has been hailed as a \"pro-LGBTQ+\" Pontifex, particularly when compared to his predecessors.",
        "content": "Pope Francis , often deemed too liberal by more conservative elements of the clergy, is under fire for using a cuss word to describe homosexual men. According to a report in The Guardian, several Italian media outlets have reported that the pontiff used the term “frociaggine”, a vulgar Italian word that roughly translates to “faggotness”, while reiterating his objection to admitting gay men to Catholic seminaries. The remark was made when the pope said that while it was important to embrace everyone, there was already too much “frociaggine” in some seminaries. The story was first reported by Dagospia, a gossip website before being covered by dailies like La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera. The media reports claimed – while quoting unnamed bishops – that the pontiff meant the derogatory terms as a “joke” and left those who heard it “surprised” and “perplexed”. One bishop is quoted saying that the pope might not have been familiar with the offensive nature of the term. Two newspapers, La Repubblica and Corriere, stated that it was decided that homosexual men should be admitted to seminaries, but the move was vetoed by the pope. The word “frociaggine” stems from the word “frocio” that refers to the English term faggot. The term faggot is often used in the Anglosphere to refer to a gay person in a derogatory manner though its shorter fag is also used for cigarettes. Historically, while the term fag/faggot has been used to refer to men perceived to be less masculine it evolved over term to refer to homosexual mean. In recent years, it has also been “reclaimed” by gay men, much like the N word was “reclaimed” by black folks. Unlike his predecessors, Francis has taken a more ambiguous approach to the LGBTQ+ community, earning the disdain of more conservative cardinals. In an impromptu press conference on the papal plane when he took over, when asked about gay priests, Francis had said: “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge? The catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalised because of this [orientation] but that they must be integrated into society.\" While approving a ruling in December 2023 allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, he has always been vocal about not allowing gay people to join the clergy and claimed he was “concerned” about the “fashion” of being gay to which the clergy is “susceptible”. Pope Francis’ ambiguous position is sharply different from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who has been a longtime opponent of homosexuality. While opposing same-sex marriage, Benedict had said: ““People dispute the idea that they have a nature, given to them by their bodily identity, that serves as a defining element of the human being. They deny their nature and decide that it is not something previously given to them, but that they make it for themselves.” The Church’s official position remains that homosexual acts are “sinful”. A 2016 decree stressed the obligation of sexual abstinence as well as “barring” gay men from the clergy. To say the Catholic Church has had a complicated relationship with sex would be an understatement. While the Church remains steadfastly opposed to abortion and some forms of birth control, it has also had a rather chequered past about dealing with sexual abuse within the clergy. While cases of sexual abuse by the clergy are more documented in various parts of the world, it’s almost impossible to pin a number in Italy because of an Italian government treaty with the Vatican the guarantees areas of immunity to bishops and priests. In the US, a 2006 documentary called Deliver Us From Evil showed how a priest named Olivier O’Grady was switched from parish to parish to cover up his rape of dozens of children. Spotlight , a 2015 Academy Award-winning team, also showed a dramatized version of a true story of the Boston Globe’s investigative reporting team shone a light on the widespread sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in the 1970s, and the cover-up attempts of the Boston archdiocese. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury published a 1,356 page report documenting the decades of sexual abuse by over 300 Catholic priests in six dioceses and also accused senior church officials in Pennsylvania and the Vatican of a “systemic cover-up”. A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Dr Thomas Plante, states that approximately 4% of the priests in the past half century (mostly ‘60s and ‘70s) had a sexual experience with a minor. The study claims that the number is “consistent with male clergy from other religious traditions” and is “significantly lower than the general adult male population which may double this number”.",

        "content": "“ Lovely Runner ” cast members have shared the best scenes of their choice! On May 28, tvN revealed the best scenes that were personally selected by each of the lead actors Byeon Woo Seok , Kim Hye Yoon , Song Geon Hee , and Lee Seung Hyub . Byeon Woo Seok, who became an icon of pure love by portraying Ryu Seon Jae, said, “I remember the scene (in episode 15) where Sun Jae restores his lost memories.” He explained, “It is the moment when Sun Jae, who has lived for 15 years with forgotten memories, reunites with Im Sol. The deep and desperate feelings of Sun Jae that I felt while acting were so vivid that I had lingering emotions, which is why I remember that scene the most.“ Kim Hye Yoon, who plays Im Sol, shared, “It is the scene (in episode 2) where Im Sol runs toward Sun Jae while holding a yellow umbrella. I thought it was Sun Jae and Im Sol’s first meeting and the beginning of their relationship at the same time.” Song Geon Hee, who takes on the role of Kim Tae Sung, also picked the same scene as Kim Hye Yoon. He remarked, “I think the epilogue of episode 2 is the best scene. I was impressed by the process of depicting Sun Jae’s feelings and how he falls in love with Im Sol as soon as he sees her holding an umbrella for him.” Lee Seung Hyub, who plays Eclipse’s leader Baek In Hyuk, shared, “I remember the scene (in episode 10) where [Bae In Hyuk] parodies Jung Dae Man (Mitsui Hisashi) from ‘Slam Dunk’ by saying, ‘I want to do music.'” He explained, “Even though it was Bae In Hyuk’s imagination, it was my first time acting with this much of a comical element. As it was a new challenge, I was very nervous at the time of filming. But I was also able to enjoy watching it because viewers said that it was entertaining.” The final episode of “Lovely Runner” airs on May 28 at 8:50 p.m. KST.

        "content": "Dear Annie: My heart is broken, and so is my wife’s. This past year, we planned a family vacation because my daughter and her family and my son and his live in a different state. We were meeting in the middle to save everyone from such a long road trip. My wife and I have been married almost 35 years, and she helped raise my two children. My grandchildren all adore her. On the second day of our trip, my wife and my son’s 7-year-old son were playing cards. My wife went to give him a hug, and out of the blue, my son and his wife literally jumped up and said, “No! We don’t do that!” It was shocking to say the least. My wife couldn’t believe it; she immediately left the room, and she says even now, four months later, that the look on our grandson’s face when that happened broke her heart. Needless to say, the rest of the trip was very awkward. I am very close to my son, and we still talk roughly every other day, but my wife will never forgive them for that. I feel like my son and his wife owe my wife an apology because things will never be the same. My son is a police officer, and he has seen a lot, and as a result he and his wife are very overprotective of his children. They don’t let them spend the night away from home because they don’t trust people. I know that we can’t be too careful, but the way they handled that situation was totally wrong. I told my wife that if they had decided that no one could be “affectionate” with their son, they should have told us that in private. Please give me some advice. Thank you! -- Heartbroken Dad and Grandfather Dear Heartbroken: You are correct that they should have spoken to you in private about their wishes that you not hug their children. By reprimanding your wife in front of her grandson, they are hurting their own son by depriving him of a grandmother’s hug -- which is a sad thing to deprive a grandson of. Instead of never forgiving, try to get curious about the why. You mentioned that your son is a police officer and has seen a lot. Maybe he just saw something very disturbing. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you have a dialogue about it so that you and your wife can have a better understanding of it. In the future, hopefully, your son and daughter-in-law never reprimand you or your wife in front of your grandchildren. But forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. So forgive. “How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” is out now!

        "content": "A WOMAN has revealed that she makes £20,000 a month from a simple side hustle, that takes minutes to set up. Taylor Couch shared details of her money making hack via a video posted to her TikTok channel, which she often uses to share side hustle tips and tricks. The side hustle pro revealed that YouTube pays around £10-£20 per 1000 video views. She then explained that simple, faceless videos such as 'relaxing cafe music mix' or 'cosy fireplace sounds' gain around 60 million views on the video sharing platform. This means that the creators of these videos made over £230,000 from just one video. To make your own video, Taylor explained that all you need to do is go to ai.invideo.io. Then, ask the AI to make you a video, being as descriptive as possible. For example, Taylor asked the AI to create a three minute YouTube video with 10 scenes of beautiful scenery, paired with relaxing music. Then click 'generate video' and select your audience. \"Boom! Within minutes you have a video\", she said. You can then edit the video if you want to, and when you're happy with it, simply download it and upload it to YouTube. You can do this as many times as you like, creating a variety of different videos. \"Then sit back, and collect income passively\", she said. Taylor's video, which was posted under the username @thecouchclub , has likely left many people impressed, as it has racked up over 780,0000 views on the video sharing platform. TikTok users raced to the video's comments section to share their thoughts. One person said: \"Golden!! Thank you for sharing this!!\" A second person said: \"Thank you, helpful tips and ideas that I really appreciate. Based on new research from Finder, an estimated 22.8 million Brits are using side hustles to top up their income. Among generation those aged 18-23 68 percent have a side hustle in 2024. Those aged 24-42 aren’t far behind, with 65 per cent having an additional source of income. Side hustles are less popular among older generations, with 40 percent of generation those aged 43-54 having one. Whereas 23 percent of people aged 55-73 and just 7 per cent of those aged 74 and over are earning extra cash this way. \"Definitely want to try this!\" A third person added: \"AI is really changing the game!!\" A fourth said: \"I love the way you can use AI to make money online\".

        "content": "SHE \"was sick\" of her greasy splashbacks that took off half the paint any time she tried to clean them. So, after getting inspiration from others online, Victoria decided to splash out on some stick on tiles from Temu to give her kitchen a revamp . She documented the process in a video on her TikTok page, as she admitted she was initially hesitant to buy from Temu after hearing mixed reviews. \"Would you believe that these stickers only cost me £16 from Temu?\" Victoria said. \"I've never bought from Temu before, and I thought it was gonna be a bit of a scam, but honestly this is so good. \"They actually look like real tiles - you cannot tell they're stickers!\" She initially showed where she'd tried to clean some of the grubbiness off her splashbacks, and it had taken the paint off. Victoria then showed the tile stickers she'd picked up, as she had been inspired by someone else who had bought the pink version. \"You simply peel back the plastic, and then you peel back the other bit for it to be sticky,\" she said, demonstrating as she went. \"I placed it on the wall like this - trust me it took me hours, but it's super easy. \"This is the final result and I am so chuffed with it!\" Victoria added in the caption: \"This isnt an ad, im so really happy with how these came out! \"You literally can't tell they are stickers!\" But the process wasn't entirely straightforward, as Victoria added: \"The cutting in around the plugs though was a REAL faff!\" \"I buy loads from there tbf,\" one person commented on the video. \"I've had some great stuff but prices have definitely gone up.\" \"Well if £16 is inflated I am sure gutted I missed them 'cheap',\" Victoria laughed. \"It doesn’t look any different on camera unfortunately,\" someone else argued. Well Polished conducted a survey and the results are in! Most Hated Household Chores Most Liked Household Chores Men VS Women: Who Puts the Work In? Men spend 7 hours 54 minutes a week cleaning. Women spend 12 hours 15 minutes a week cleaning. \"I wish they were more defined!\" But Victoria was entirely unbothered by the remark, as she replied: \"That's okay! \"I don't look at it through a camera! \"And boy has it made a difference in real life!\"",

Here are some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers: Biggest stock gainers Shares of meme stock GameStop ( GME ) surged around 17% after the company announced the completion of a previously disclosed, roughly $933.4M equity offering through the sale of 45M shares. It intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments. The offering follows a recent spike in meme shares following the return of influential trader and analyst Keith Gill to social media. Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” was an important figure in the 2021 meme-stock frenzy. CAVA Group's ( CAVA ) shares rose over 5% ahead of the company's Q results, scheduled after the market close, with analysts estimating EPS of $0.05 and the consensus revenue of $245.46M. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions, while revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 1 downward revision. Biggest stock losers Hello Group's ( MOMO ) shares fell nearly 6% after the company reported mixed Q1 results, with revenue dropping 9% Y/Y on the back of a decline in live video service revenues, Value-added service revenues, and Mobile games revenues. Monthly active users on the Tantan app fell to 13.7M, compared to 19.5M a year earlier, while Momo's total paying users were 7.1M in Q1, compared to 7.8M a year ago. The company also sees Q2 total net revenues between RMB2.65B and RMB2.75B, a decrease of 15.5% to 12.4% Y/Y.

While Asake and Seyi Vibez have not had any public spat, there has always been a chill between their fanbases, especially on social media. In a recent interview with The Beat FM Lagos, Ayra Starr was asked whether her decision to work with both men on her sophomore album, ‘The Year I Turned 21,’ was intentional because of their rivalry and she denied knowledge of the rivalry. According to her, she decided to work with them because she loves their sonic prowess. She said, “I didn’t put Asake and Seyi Vibez on my album because of their rivalry. I didn’t know about the rivalry between Asake and Seyi Vibez. I just love both of them as artists. “I’m really big on sonics; what would sound good sonically. My team is always thinking of the business side but I’m just thinking of who would be sonically compatible with me. And I’ve been listening to Seyi Vibez’s ‘Different Pattern’ for a very long time. So I decided to work with him. When I sent the record to him, he sent his verse almost immediately. They were very quick with it. Asake, too, he sent me his verse in three days.” Related Topics: Asake Ayra Starr Seyi Vibez Don't Miss How I met my husband – Veekee James You may like I’m not aware of rivalry between Asake, Seyi Vibez – Ayra Starr ‘Sabigays’: Controversy as Ayra Starr embraces LGBTQ fans at Brazil concert Ayra Starr relishes BET nominations Burna Boy, Ayra Starr, others bag nominations for 2024 Bet Awards ‘I didn’t know Rihanna was real until I saw her’ – Ayra Starr ‘I’m single but have broken a few hearts’ – Ayra Starr Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "description": "An update from the illustrator who was told \"just go work for Disney.\"",
        "content": "Dear Readers : I appreciate it when people give me updates on previously published advice. Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldn’t tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husband’s attachment to his friend? Below is a Q&A originally published in 2016, and then the recent update. Dear Amy : I’m hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise I’m always drawing, painting and networking. From what I’ve learned, it takes years before most artists can quit their day jobs. I’m prepared for this; I’m in no way lazy, but I know it will take me a long time. I keep my head down and keep trying. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They don’t understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: “Just go work for Disney,” or “Nobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.” Or, “Do it for the exposure if you have to.” They don’t trust that I know what I’m doing, and they don’t recognize how hard I’m working. It gets to the point where I don’t want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that I’m not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? – Struggling Artist Dear Struggling : Everybody’s an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more “expert” their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), “You should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!” This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. It’s a quick way to feel like a loser. Don’t stop talking about your work (if you’re asked), and don’t avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice, but look for effective ways to cope with it. “You should work for Disney,” could be met with “That might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?” Remember always that this is really your fan club; they’re just disguised as a Greek chorus of know-it-alls. Dear Amy: I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, I’m still a struggling artist and I’m still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but I’m excited to say I’ve just received an offer on my picture book. I am going to be a published children’s book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators and got involved with the local chapter. I’m lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and can’t give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. She’s still my biggest fan. – Soon to be Published Dear Soon to be Published: Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library. Dear Amy : You recently answered a question from “Living a Lie,” who had been lying for 50 years, claiming to be a Vietnam veteran. I am a female military veteran. I, along with countless other women, served proudly alongside our male counterparts. I am disappointed with your comment to Living a Lie about “many thousands of men who served during the Vietnam War, and who have oftentimes suffered because of their service.” Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldn’t tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husband’s attachment to his friend? Too often our female soldiers are not acknowledged or recognized for their vital contributions in military service. A quick Google search may have provided you the opportunity to be more inclusive with your response. – Proud Veteran Dear Proud : I’ve heard from several women veterans, highlighting your point. I should have been inclusive in my response, and I apologize for my mistake. You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O. Box 194, Freeville, NY 13068.

        "description": "Actor Manchu Manoj returns to Tollywood after an eight-year hiatus. During this break, he found love, married Mounika, and welcomed their daughter in April 2024. As he prepares for a comeback with Mirai and What the Fish, Manoj reflects on embracing fatherhood and a new perspective on life.",
        "content": "Actor Manchu Manoj is celebrating two decades in Tollywood this year, but it’s been an eight-year hiatus since his last film. The actor, who made his debut in a lead role with Donga Dongadi in 2004, attributes this hiatus to a “necessary break to rebuild his personal life”. The actor shares, “During this time, I found love and married Mounika . Our joy was doubled when we welcomed our daughter in April 2024.” Manoj has been relishing this new chapter in life, embracing fatherhood fully. Now, as he gears up for a comeback in 2025 with Mirai and then What the Fish , Hyderabad Times catches up with the actor for a tete-e-tete. Excerpts... The first time Manoj saw his baby girl, admittedly his blood pressure shot up because of his excitement. “Experiencing the birth of my daughter was surreal; it’s still sinking in. Holding her for the first time, I felt like I was cradling a precious gift from God. My sister, Lakshmi, handed her to me in the operation theatre, and as I embraced her, my emotions overwhelmed me,” he says, adding, “Witnessing my wife’s strength and pain during labour, while trying to comfort her, transformed me profoundly. It was a moment that reshaped my perspective on life.” When his daughter was born, the room filled with joy as she let out a soft roar. The nickname “Puli” stuck, inspired by her initial reaction. “It’s a temporary moniker until we settle on her official name. The ‘MM’ in ‘MM Puli’ symbolises our bond—Manoj and Mounika,” he says. Manoj is set to make a comeback with Mirai. It was HanuMan actor Teja Sajja who approached Manoj to star in the film. “He narrated the script to me, and I fell in love with the character. It’s a crazy concept. Coming to my other project, What The Fish, it is currently in the pre-production phase and the shooting will soon commence in Canada,” he reveals, adding that the audience will witness him in never-before-seen avatars in his upcoming films. Manoj was born with a passion for acting and he is always hungry for good roles. “Like Hulk says, ‘I’m always angry’, I’m always hungry for acting. When I hear a new script, my energy levels always go up,” he shares. It was in the year 2016 that Manoj felt he deserved a break. “I was 11 months old when I entered the industry as a child actor! When you are born into a film family, you need to realise when to pause and make yourself a priority. Finding Mounika helped me restart my life with a fresh perspective,” he says.",

Our hearts were shattered but it surely made our faith stronger,” she said in the caption. “We may not know why it had to happen but we trust that the Lord has better plans and all we can do is to let go and surrender. I know in my heart we will see you again, my love,” she added. Pineda then revealed she named her unborn child Christiana. “For now, enjoy your time in heaven along with all the angels,” she stated. “We can’t wait to have you back in our arms in His time.” A post shared by Charee Pineda-Soledad (@chareepineda) Aside from her husband Martell Soledad and their firstborn Cesco who were both with the actress in the hospital, Pineda also received comfort from her fellow celebrity moms Angeline Quinto, Yasmien Kurdi, Lovely Abella and Melissa Ricks through the comments section.

        "description": "Poco F6 review: Big display, bigger battery but nothing else",
        "content": "Listen to Story Poco F6 is not the dream smartphone that was promised. If I were writing this review within a couple of days of using the phone, my verdict could have been different. The initial days with Poco F6 were pretty good. However, I used the Poco F6 for a little over a week and I saw it struggle in some areas. While it has its pros, the cons overpower the overall performance. Let’s dive deep into the details of the latest Poco flagship. Poco F6 was launched in India on May 23 at a starting price of Rs 29,999. While the smartphone has a plethora of listed features, Poco focused on 4 major parts for this flagship — display, gaming performance, camera, and battery. The smartphone is available in three different variants. The standard variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage is priced at Rs 29,999. And other variants are 12GB+256GB and 12GB+ 512GB priced at Rs 31,999 and Rs 33,999, respectively. But is the smartphone worth it? Let's see. The display is perhaps one of the best features of Poco F6. The screen does justice to the vibrant colours presented on it which enhances the gaming or Netflix sessions on the phone. I watched the last legs of IPL on Poco F6 and I have nothing to complain about. It hit the brightness of 2400 nits and I could feel it. While I mostly watched content during the latter part of the day, it was easy to text even under the peak sunlight. The touch is quite smooth and cheers the response rate. I did not feel any hindrance when it came to the touch and display. Adding on to the same point, the fingerprint lock is also built so well that it instantly, within a few seconds, picks up and unlocks the phone. I have a habit of using the face lock — which is also very quick— and could not use the fingerprint lock that often. But whenever I did, it worked just fine. The smartphone has a boxy look with curved edges and a very big screen. To review Poco F6, I moved from iPhone 13 which was a big screen change. I am not kidding when I say that the Poco F6 is as big as my face. While it was excellent for watching content and gaming, Poco F6 is not handy. I do not follow the “phone in the front pocket” phenomenon (because my denim pockets are equal to nothing) but the phone is too big to keep in your hand or in your back pocket. I struggled to use the smartphone with one hand only. I tried typing with my left hand on the phone, but couldn’t reach for the letters at the other end of the keyboard. Coming to the back panel of Poco F6, I was using the classic black version. The phone looks sleek and has a classy edge to it. But I also noticed that it gets attached to smudges and fingerprints. The big gas stove cameras add a heavier look to the device, but in fact Poco F6 is very light. The battery was another aspect that impressed me massively. I never charged the device twice in a day. And on a day when I did not use the device much, the battery was able to stretch for another half a day. Staying true to what was said in the event, the device charged up pretty quickly. In just 15 minutes, the charging speed picked up pace from 41 per cent to 88 per cent, thanks to 90W turbocharging support. Poco F6 features a big 5,000mAh battery. The only fact to be worried about is that it heats up while charging. Even after Poco said that the device has several sensors all across the body to cool down the system. And the disappointment begins! On a personal note, the camera is not that impressive. I tried to click images in all modes, but did not enjoy the experience. The camera does not do justice to the subject being clicked. The images clicked on the phone also have really high saturation, and despite switching off the skin filters, the phone clears out the subject’s skin, even in the selfie mode. Now, this may actually not be a dealbreaker for all users, because this eliminates the need to edit and image and are somewhat social media-ready. However, anyone looking to get at least close-to-authentic shots on the phone, would be disappointed. The Poco F6 features a dual-rear camera system with a 50-megapixel Sony main lens and an 8MP Sony ultrawide lens. The pictures in a well-lit environment come out fine, but the night mode is a bit underwhelming. Pictures clicked by Poco F6 I think the camera is just on the boundary of workable but fails to make it into the great category. The portrait mode has good edge detection, but the overall result is a heavily touched up picture, and I am not a fan of that. Poco F6 portrait mode Here are a few pictures I managed to click this week: It is all well if it ends well. But here, it does not. Poco bragged about the gaming experience so much that one would think that this device could take up hours of gaming. The truth is, after playing Call of Duty for only 30 minutes, I could feel the device heat up. I understand that Delhi is under the wrath of the sun these days, but even in a well air conditioned room, the device heats up during gaming sessions. It was not uncomfortably hot, but it was warm enough that I decided to give it a rest. The plus point, however, is that it cools down quickly as well. I think the liquid cooling system is doing its job. The Hyper OS was supposed to be a better one than the previous operating system, but I felt there were a few drawbacks. Starting with the bloatware on the phone. If I am spending Rs 30,000 on a device, I expect it to be clean. But Poco F6 comes with a bunch of extra applications pre-installed in it. These can be uninstalled, sure, but I would personally prefer no bloatware in the first place. What makes the experience worse is ads in the user interface. For instance, if you want to play any of these pre-installed games, you will have to go through different advertisements. In fact, every time I wanted to search for an app or content, Poco F6 would throw an ad on my face. Over and above, for one time, the device processor slowed down and could not load the home page for a few seconds. But this happened only for one time and never again. Poco might bite me back saying, one can easily uninstall applications which are not in use. My question is how many should I remove? It entails a number of games including, Bubble shooter, Tiles, Block puzzle, Word trip. It also has other heavier applications, like Snapchat and LinkedIn pre-installed. The bloatware does not only take up a huge amount of storage but it also slows down the processor over time. And it is quite frustrating to look at these many apps when I am not even using them. Poco F6 is priced at Rs 29,999 in India. It may make sense for someone looking for a device with a good battery backup and a beautiful display. The phone is also great for users who want to game on their mobile on a budget. However, the excessive bloatware, heating up and okayish camera, makes the phone harder to recommend.",

        "content": "The European Union (EU) and US have been “too soft” on Serbia and should set a deadline for it to adopt sanctions on Russia, Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti told the Financial Times in an interview. He added that the alignment of Serbia’s foreign policy to that of the EU is of vital importance to ensure a sense of security in Kosovo. “Once Serbia puts sanctions on the Russian Federation, then that would be a moment when they would show that they want to get integrated into EU, and Serbia without Russia cannot threaten the security of the continent. So then, I could trust that they basically want peace. And US and EU would not try to appease them anymore,” said Kurti. He justified the Kosovo police raid on several branches of the Serbian Postal Savings Bank in the north of Kosovo last week, in which Serbian dinars, which have been “outlawed” in Kosovo, were seized. Kurti said the restrictions stemmed from Kosovo’s Constitution, which stipulates only one means of payment. He said two-thirds of Serbs received benefits from Kosovo in euros. The Kosovo prime minister declined to say when Pristina would pull its special police back from the northern municipalities but insisted that “complaints from Serbs about their presence were receding.” Kurti conceded there are “sometimes differences” with his European and US allies “when it comes to strategies, operations and tactics on the ground on one hand, and when it comes to relations with Serbia,” but not on values or principles. He said the West’s “soft” approach was “a consequence of having high hopes that sooner rather than later, Serbia will jump into the western democratic camp. In my view, we have waited for too long to be still hopeful,” Kurti told the FT.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, DuPont (NYSE: DD ) stock received an upgraded rating from Citi, moving from Neutral to Buy, with an increased price target set at $95, up from the previous $85. The upgrade follows a positive investor reaction to recent company announcements, with DuPont shares experiencing an approximate 3% rise in the 1.5 days following the news. Citi's analysis indicates that DuPont's decision to operate its businesses independently could drive value through targeted growth and clearer portfolio structure. Additionally, the firm anticipates benefits from a recovery in the electronics sector and a reduction in destocking in more challenging markets. The main concern among investors has been DuPont's valuation, especially in the Electronics and New DuPont (RemainCo) segments. However, after reassessing DuPont's Sum of the Parts (SOTP) valuation in light of the new business structure, Citi has expressed confidence in the company's prospects. The firm's revised outlook is partially based on strong earnings expectations from the electronics division over the next 18 months. Moreover, Citi suggests that further details on the company's separation plan could act as additional positive catalysts throughout the year. DuPont's stock performance and Citi's upgraded rating reflect a broader sense of optimism regarding the company's strategic moves and potential market recovery. The new price target of $95 represents a significant increase and underscores Citi's positive expectations for DuPont's financial future.

        "content": "THIS is the shock moment riot cops raid a Costa del Sol club packed with bikini-clad tourists in a chilling crackdown known as Operation Marbella. The chilling footage shows nearly 20 heavily-armed police storming the Ocean Club Marbella in the Spanish resort of Puerto Banus and ordering revellers out of the pool. British holidaymakers watched on speechless in their swim shorts and bikinis as officers clad in body armour crashed the venue in a broad-daylight raid. Tourists packing out the \"beautiful people\" venue, which over the weekend held one of its two annual champagne parties popular with Bank Holiday visitors from the UK , were urged to keep calm. Police issued loudspeaker messages in Spanish and English saying: “This is just a routine check. The minute we finish you can continue enjoying your afternoon. “Don’t worry, there’s nothing serious going on.” But the images of the operation, which lasted nearly two hours and also involved a police helicopter hovering overhead, showed why some revellers were left uneasy over the ordeal. One clubber is understood to have been arrested, although police have not yet commented officially on the reason for the detention. The spectacular club raid followed a string of shootings in the area, sparking the launch of the so-called Marbella Plan last month to keep British and Irish tourists safe. Police warned locals and visitors at the time they could expect to see more random stops and police checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They said nothing about surprise raids on busy tourist-popular venues, although earlier this month heavily-armed officers crashed a gym at a sports club in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia near Puerto Banus and made three arrests. Gym-users were asked for their ID before being allowed to continue with their routines. The series of shootings so far this year in the Marbella area included a March 11 attack on British-run eatery La Sala near Puerto Banus. The shooting led to the arrests in April of a British man and Irish national described by police as having links to organised crime. Kerry Katona recently claimed she had U-turned on a decision to move to the famous Costa del Sol resort with her family, including fiancé Ryan Mahoney, because of the violent incidents there. Fernando Bentabol, the prosecutor in charge of combating narco crime in the province of Malaga, which Marbella is part of, shone the spotlight on its dark underbelly in a recent newspaper interview. Asked by a local Spanish journalist if the Costa del Sol was turning into Medellin, Colombia’s second largest city previously the most violent in the world and the former home of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar , he said: “Yes and no. \"It can’t be compared to Medellin because countries such as Colombia are the ones that produce drugs, and most of the actions there are related to plantations, as happens in Morocco for example with cannabis. “We are in the area where the drugs are introduced and distributed to Europe. “But in terms of the level of the organisations involved and their economic capacity, yes it can of course be compared.” Locals have branded parts of Marbella like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\". One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media, expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: “A stray bullet could end up entering a house.” In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella muncipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18 day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. By Tom Malley SPANISH police have launched \"Operation Marbella\" to crackdown on violence and keep Brits safe after a spate of recent gang shootings. The Costa del Sol resort is fast becoming a hotspot for crime and cops have warned locals and visitors they can expect to see more random stops and officer checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They are understood to be increasing vigilance in residential areas as well as shopping centres and nightspots, like the millionaire’s playground of Puerto Banus. It comes after two terrifying shootings in March, within the space of a week. As police crackdown on crime they are recruiting the help of sniffer dogs and “aerial resources” - including helicopters and drones. The start of the operation, which will continue through the summer season into October, comes after locals started branding areas like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\" following four shooting incidents in just over a month. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the “original classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europe’s chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.” It adds: “Daytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. \"Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.” It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages round its saltwater pool cost up to €1,150 (£980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot, a luxury champagne from France . Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional €1120 (£955) minimum spend on Saturdays. A WAVE of anti-tourist measures are being implemented across Europe to curb mass tourism in popular holiday hotspots. Overcrowding has become the main problem in many sunny destinations, with authorities trying to find a solution to keep tourists and locals happy. Officials have attempted to reduce the impact of holidaymakers by implementing additional taxes on tourists, or banning new hotels. Earlier this year Venice became the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for holidaymakers after it started charging day-trippers €5 (£4.30) if visiting the historical Italian centre. It was followed by an area in Barcelona which resorted to removing a well-used bus route from Apple and Google Maps to stop crowds of tourists from using the bus. Meanwhile, San Sebastián in the north of Spain, limited the maximum number of people on guided visits to 25 to avoid congestion, noise, nuisance and overcrowding. The city has already banned the construction of new hotels. The Spanish government has allowed restaurants to charge customers more for sitting in the shade in Andalucia. Benidorm has introduced time restrictions, as swimming in the sea between midnight and 7am could cost a whopping £1,000. The Canary Islands are also considering adopting measures to regulate the number of visitors - and charge tourists a daily tax. Greece has already enforced a tourist tax during the high season (from March to October) with visitors expected to pay from €1 (£0.86) to €4 (£3.45) per night, depending on the booked accommodation. Officials in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia want to introduce a fee for travellers to remind people to be courteous during their trips.",

        "description": "The father of NRL star Payne Haas is accused of being at the “centre” of a failed drug smuggling attempt in Indonesia.",
        "content": "Indonesian investigators expect to extradite Gregor Haas from the Philippines “very, very soon” for his alleged role in the attempted importation of enough drugs to qualify a convicted person for the death penalty. Haas, an Australian citizen and the father of NRL star Payne Haas , has been in detention in the Philippines since his arrest this month in a dramatic sting involving local and Indonesian police, who had been hunting him for months. Gregor Johann Haas poses for a mugshot following his arrest in Cebu province. Credit: AP The latter are desperate for him to face justice and questioning in Indonesia. Australia, though mostly silent on this case, is against any outcome that opens the possibility of execution. The Indonesians accuse Haas of links to the notorious Sinaloa Cartel of Mexico and of attempting to import more than five kilograms of methamphetamines, hidden in consignments of ceramic flooring, through Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in December. The drugs were allegedly sent from the Mexican City of Guadalajara. Indonesian narcotics agency spokesman Sulistyo Pudjo Hartono accused Haas of being at the “centre” of the operation and “above” six other suspects, all of them Indonesian. Brisbane Broncos player Payne Haas (left) and Gregor Haas at the 2019 Dally M Awards at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney. Credit: AAP Sulistyo said Haas, 46, had been living on a small island off Lombok on a temporary stay permit as an investor and businessman. The Australian was believed to have entered the Philippines on December 6, several days after Sulistyo said Indonesia received intelligence about the alleged shipment. He would not speculate on whether Haas had received a tip-off. Where the Australian gets sent next, and under what circumstances, is a matter for the Philippines, which is now under the more Western-friendly leadership of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. While authorities there do not have to consult Australia, they have promised to do so anyway in a show of goodwill between the two countries. Asked if Haas could be deported to Australia, Sulistyo declared emphatically, “No!” “If an Indonesian citizen commits a crime, killing an Australian citizen in Sydney or Melbourne, he will be prosecuted over there, he will be indicted over there, he will be questioned over there and will be imprisoned over there. It is all similar everywhere,” he said. A decision by the Philippines Bureau of Immigration may be weeks away, or possibly longer. Complicating the matter of extradition, and potentially putting international loyalties to the test, is the case of Philippine citizen Mary Jane Veloso, who has been on death row in Indonesia for a more than a decade on a contested drug conviction. Marcos Jr is under intense pressure to bring her home, and Haas could be used by both Indonesia and the Philippines as a bargaining chip. The Australian Federal Police has said it had no role in tracking or arresting Haas. Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island's president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan's legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. Taiwan's legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke out into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: While dismissing the rumours of becoming the next head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh empathizes with Hardik Pandya as he navigates a challenging phase in his career. Despite Pandya's struggles in the IPL , both as a captain and player for Mumbai Indians, Harbhajan believes that he will perform differently when representing India in the upcoming T20 World Cup . He hopes that Pandya, who \"hasn't been a free man in the last two months,\" will find his form during the tournament, as a strong performance from him could significantly boost India's chances of success. \"When he wears that blue jersey, he will be a different Hardik Pandya because we know he can score those runs and take those wickets. I want Hardik to come good as he has gone through a lot and I wish him all the very best to have a very good tournament for India,\" said Harbhajan. \"If he has a good tournament, obviously India will have a great chance to go forward. Yes, his form is a bit of a concern...and lot of other stuff was going on around him, his shifting from Gujarat to Mumbai, was a big change and the team (MI) didn't react too well to Hardik coming back and that too as captain,\" the 43-year-old added. He urges the team management to ensure that Pandya and Rohit are on the \"same page\" and that the entire team plays together as a cohesive unit. \"It looked like they (MI) were not playing together as a team. So there was a lot going on. Hardik wasn't a free man in the last two months. I believe both of them and many others who have played in different teams will have to come together to do something special for the nation,\" he said. Regarding India's pace attack, Harbhajan believes that Jasprit Bumrah is the only bowler who can consistently perform well regardless of the conditions. He feels that Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj may need assistance from the pitch to be effective. Harbhajan hopes that the other bowlers will step up and take responsibility alongside Bumrah. \"Pace attack definitely could be a concern because because Bumrah is in a different league for the kind of bowler he is. He will win you games on any kind of pitch. He doesn't need conditions whereas other bowlers like Arshdeep and Siraj would need help from conditions. If there's bounce, Siraj might do well. He is tall, can also swing it both ways, hits the deck hard and has got pace. But if wickets are slow then the challenge begins for other bowlers,\" said Harbhajan. Impressed by Virat Kohli 's improved strike rate and the addition of new shots to his repertoire during the IPL, Harbhajan emphasizes the importance of Kohli and Rohit Sharma scoring quickly in the Powerplay while also respecting the conditions in the USA and West Indies. \"Virat has shown a lot of improvement from last year to this year and people spoke about his strike rate. It was in 130s during last year and this time it is in 160s,\" he said. Regarding the speculation surrounding Gautam Gambhir as a potential candidate for India's head coach position, Harbhajan believes that the most crucial task for any coach is to bring the team together and ensure they play as a cohesive unit. \"I don't think I will be able to give that much time. At this stage of my life I have a young family and I need to be around them and look after them. Yes, when the right time comes, I will put my foot forward and say I am ready for it,\" he concluded.",

        "description": "Qatar tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors in the country’s economy contributing to attracting investments and increasing the revenues.The post Qatar to simplify licensing procedures for hotels appeared first on Travel And Tour World.",
        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 A joint initiative by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism aims to simplify licensing procedures and stimulate the tourism sector. In a bid to boost the nation’s hospitality and tourism sectors, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism have launched an initiative to streamline licensing procedures for tourism establishments and businesses. The initiative includes elements like seasonal discounts, festival-specific discounts, promotional offers, and special deals, all designed to stimulate the tourism sector. The key focus is on simplifying and speeding up ‘Qualitative Licensing Services’ making it easier to overcome challenges faced when applying for promotional and price reduction licenses, as well as procedures for festival, event and exhibition licensing. Hassan Sultan Al-Ghanim, Assistant Undersecretary for Consumer Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said: “This was introduced to facilitate the procedures for obtaining specific licenses for tourism and hospitality establishments, where obtaining the license would take one business day, with the prerequisite that all terms and conditions are met and the required documents submitted, this would have a direct positive impact on the entire sector’s value chain. Qatar tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors in the country’s economy, which contributes to attracting investments and increasing the revenues. “This initiative comes within the framework of the efforts of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to develop the business environment and facilitate business ventures in the country, and to establish an encouraging investment environment for entrepreneurs and investors. It is important to shed light on the Ministry’s keenness to consolidate collaborations with various relevant government entities with the aim to facilitate and streamline procedures for granting the necessary approvals and licenses to establish a business.” An integral part of the initiative is the issuance of a single-fee annual license that includes all offers and discounts provided by hotels, as announced through their marketing plans. The application process for the ‘single- license’ will be overseen by Visit Qatar, the main branch of Qatar Tourism, thus ensuring streamlined procedures and enhanced inter-sector cooperation. Omar Al Jaber, Acting Chief of the Tourism Development Sector at Qatar Tourism, said: “The new licensing initiative by Qatar Tourism and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry aims to enhance tourism offerings across relevant businesses and provide necessary protection for the activities of these establishments. Thus, providing the sector the flexibility to intensify its efforts by launching promotional campaigns that revive their work as well as provide tourists opportunities to enjoy attractive offerings, enhancing visitors’ experience. This initiative reflects Qatar Tourism’s commitment to develop and expand the reach of the tourism sector in the country, by including more tourism and hospitality businesses and focus on being comprehensive with its licensing protocol and elevating the efficacy and transparency of key services.”",
