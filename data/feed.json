        "content": "Pakistan has demanded the Taliban government in Afghanistan to hand over outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan‚Äôs (TTP) , who were involved in the attack on Chinese engineers in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported ARY News. The attack, which took place on March 26 in Bisham city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa‚Äôs Shangla district, claimed the lives of five Chinese engineers along with one Pakistani citizen. The incident took place when the convoy was travelling between Islamabad and a hydroelectric dam construction site in Dasu in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The District Inspector General (DIG) of Malakand said that a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese nationals, as reported by ARY News. Addressing a press conference along with officials of the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Necta), Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan has taken up the issue with the Afghan interim government and urged them to take action against terrorist activities being carried out on their land. The interior minister added that the TTP orchestrated the Shangla terror attack from inside Afghanistan. ‚ÄúWe have requested the interim government in Afghanistan to arrest the leadership of banned TTP,‚Äù he said. Following the attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instructed the concerned authorities to conduct a thorough joint investigation into the Shangla suicide attack on Chinese nationals, utilising all the resources of the state. PM Sharif chaired a high-level emergency meeting in the aftermath of the attack on Chinese nationals, further appreciating the alacrity with which law enforcement agencies and locals responded to the attack, saving many lives that could have been lost. ‚ÄúTerrorism is a transnational threat that has been instrumentalized by the enemies of Pakistan to stymie Pakistan‚Äôs progress and development. The acts targeting Pakistan-China friendship are particularly aimed at creating mistrust between the two iron brothers,‚Äù he said. However, on Sunday, while briefing the journalists, Interior Minister Naqvi said that the probe agencies have prepared an investigation report, adding that they had concrete evidence that the TTP used Afghan soil to carry out the terror attack on Chinese engineers, reported Al Jazeera.

        "content": "To most residents of Kujigbi, a remote settlement in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the most pressing challenge has been how to put three square meals on their table. They are more interested in anything that could provide an escape route out of poverty and hunger. Although residents of the community can be said to living very close to the seat of power in Nigeria, hunger and poverty had been a major enemy they contend with on a daily basis. They seem to have no connection with the sophistications that go with modern life because they lack access to social development and can be said to be disconnected from the larger society in Nigeria. Apart from hunger and poverty, the community, suffers from acute deprivation of basic social amenities. The people seem to have learnt to live their lives with or without government‚Äôs intervention. While they may not be presently facing food shortage, they definitely cannot boost of a resilient food system. However, they will live to remember this year‚Äôs United Nations‚Äô World Food Day because the celebration has undoubtedly brought them the kind of message that soothes the heart. The message of the World Food Day, became more meaningful to them, when an Abuja based nonprofit organisation, Princely Kids Foundation and other partners stormed the community to propagate the ideals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which the celebration highlights. The event featured talks to sensitise the people about how to meet their basic food needs and meet the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation deliberately chose the occasion of the World Food Day 2020 to highlight how food and agriculture are an essential part of the COVID-19 response, and how it could support the efforts towards economic recovery, especially for people who are limited by many socio-economic factors. Princess Jombo, who led the team to the community , stated that fighting hunger and poverty is an essential part of nation building. Jombo who struggled to hold back emotions on seeing the economic conditions of these rural people, called on privileged Nigerians to make more commitment towards empowering the less privileged members of the society. She said that an egalitarian society where citizens are empowered to actively participate in the governance process, cannot be achieved when basic needs of humanity like food and shelter remain an unaffordable luxury. She revealed that over the years, her Foundation with the support of some individuals and partner organisations have reached out to vulnerable communities, to bridge the ever widening gap between the poor and the rich. ‚ÄúPoverty breeds hunger and hunger breeds much more. We need to create a playing field for everyone, because we all need a chance for a better future. Let us empower each other to become much more,‚Äù she said. Jombo noted that when people have access to decent food, the mind would have been empowered to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of their community. She explained that delivering food items to over 500 indigent residents in Kujigbi community was a part of the efforts of her Foundation and partners to support the well articulated objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) According to her, the noble objectives which the proponents of SDG seek to achieve cannot be left for the government alone, but must be the collective responsibility of all stakeholders. Jombo noted that her team identified the community as one of the most vulnerable segments of the population in dire need of assistance in Abuja. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation in collaboration with other partners were working out measures to reach out to more vulnerable communities both within the FCT and other parts of the country. It was further learnt that there were some programmes already articulated to meet special needs of vulnerable children and women in hard-to- reach remote villages across the country. ‚ÄúToday we stand with over 150 countries and we promote global sensitization and an undertaking for those who suffer from hunger and malnutrition. This day creates a view for us to look into our future. Let us grow, nourish, and sustain because together, our actions are our future. ‚ÄúToday, we take collective measures and we say no more. We say: NO! to hunger, NO! to poverty, No, No, No. The covid-19 pandemic has been a time to reflect. The World Food Day 2020 is a call for global cooperation and solidarity. This year gives clarity and explains the uttermost need to help the most vulnerable recover from the crisis‚Äù, Jombo said. Inside Abuja gathered that one of the critical points of SDGs is to fight hunger and poverty, with reliable dietary plans for rural families. Seeing the crowd of Kujigbi residents who gathered to receive food and other assistance from the visiting team, was a resounding evidence that hunger could be a more lethal weapon to humanity than the pandemic. The confessions of some residents of the community gave credence to the fact that what the rural people need to become productive members of the society, could just be food on their table. While Lukas Japhet said that the rice gift, members of the community received from the team was an unaffordable commodity to most of them, Esther Kunegi noted that many families had gotten an unquantifiable solace..",

        "content": "Jennifer Lopez has expressed her alarm after her image was used in fraudulent AI scams. The star, who is currently starring as the central character in Netflix's newest sci-fi flick Atlas - a film concerning issues of AI - voiced trepidations about technology's rapid progression, particularly considering her public persona. J-Lo, 54, remembered adverts falsely \"selling skincare that I know nothing about\", featuring doctored images of her face complete with aged wrinkles. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . READ MORE: Reese Witherspoon's ex Ryan Phillippe shares 'hot' throwback of former couple J-Lo voiced her concerns Speaking to Variety, she said: \"It's really scary. Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.\" However, she also acknowledged that AI carries potential benefits and encouraged a balanced perspective towards both its positive and negative aspects. She added: \"I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities.\" Emphasising on the last note, the Hustlers star said, \"These movies that are talking about AI - especially this one - do a really good job of showing both sides.\" As for 'Atlas', J-Lo, who portrays a data analyst employing AI to shield Earth from an evil robot played by Simu Liu, highlighted how the movie presents both sides of the AI debate. She clarified: \"I think this movie does a good job of showing how AI could go incredibly wrong, and this is how it could go really right.\" Recently, Jennifer made her worries known regarding the abrupt emergence of AI in our daily lives, while also discussing filming some of the film's more intense sequences. Speaking to Extra, she expressed her concerns: \"I am. I'm worried about that. I think it's a scary thing and we have to kind of be careful about it and really think about where it's going.\" She recalled her initial expectations: \"I thought it would be me, by myself, do the takes, be so fast, don't have to worry about anybody else not remembering their lines... First day, you're falling through the planets. It's all going crazy.\" Reflecting on the intense filming process, she said: \"Now, your leg's broke... It was so high-intensity every day, and without having another actor kind of to give you half the energy, it's just all you. I was exhausted. I would leave the 'Atlas' set limping.\" Follow the Mirror US News page on Facebook All the latest news, showbiz, lifestyle and sports updates, brought to you by our dedicated American team.

Abdul, who disclosed this during a public lecture organised as part of activities to mark his first year in office as Rector of the 77-year-old college, pledged that ‚Äúmore is still to come from his leadership that will signal a future filled with promise and innovation for the college.‚Äù While commending the innovation and development the college has witnessed under the leadership of the Rector, the Chairman, DSE Foundation, Chief Tunde Fanumokun, described him as a pride to reckon with and a technological game changer. Fanimokun, who chaired of the lecture, extolled Dr Abdul‚Äôs virtues, saying his simplicity and humility are some of his characteristics that have endeared him to the entire college community, declaring that YABATECH should be proud of a Rector that is a ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù whose innovative ideas and leadership style have positioned the college at the forefront of tertiary education in Nigeria and beyond. In his keynote address, Pa George Majekodunmi Okufi, the first indigenous Rector of the College, also lauded Abdul for his innovative leadership style, which he said has brought about tangible improvements in the college. Therefore, Pa Okufi urged the college community to rally behind the Rectors vision of elevating the college to global standards. Also, the South-West Zonal Director of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Elder Ayo Aroge, commended the Rector for raising the standards of the college, adding that his commitment to Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) aligned with the Board‚Äôs mission to promote skills development across Nigeria. The guest lecturer, who is the Rector of Redeemers College of Technology and Management (RECTEM), Dr Awoh Stella Mofunanya, in her lecture on ‚ÄúLeadership and Service: The Need for Creativity, Innovation, and Excellence,‚Äù reiterated that in today‚Äôs rapidly evolving world, effective leadership and dedicated service require a blend of creativity, innovation, and excellence. She praised the Rector‚Äôs approach to incorporating these elements into his leadership style, ensuring that YABATECH remains adaptive and resilient in facing future challenges. ‚ÄúIn today‚Äôs rapidly evolving world, effective leadership and dedicated service are crucial for the sustained growth and success of any organisation or community. The traditional models of leadership and service are no longer sufficient, hence the need for creativity, innovation, and excellence,‚Äù she stressed.",

        "content": "A Division bench of the Orissa High Court has remitted the delay condonation application of the petitioner back to the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax ( PCIT ) as the rejection of the condonation application stating that the deficiency in the return could not be complied and the Form 3CB and 3CD as prescribed for filing of the return was required to be uploaded by the Chartered Accountant which came to the notice of the petitioner, who was ill, was done in an arbitrary manner. For the assessment year 2021-22 when the petitioner had submitted his return and the same was rejected on the ground of delay. According to the petitioner, the return under the provisions of the statute could not be furnished because of delay made under various reasons which were beyond his control and unless the delay is condoned, the filing of return could not be made by the petitioner. B. Panda appeared for the petitioner and S.C. Mohanty, Sr. Standing Counsel appeared for the Income Tax Department. As such, the petitioner was under treatment on account of his frequent illness and finally kept under the treatment of Dr. P.G. Satpathy, a Medicine Specialist for the period commencing from 22.03.2022 to 01.04.2022 and medical certificate was issued in this connection which was produced for consideration. The petitioner‚Äôs transactions for the assessment year 2021-22 was in fact coming under the limit of statutory audit as per Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act and unless the Auditor‚Äôs Report is accompanied in the IT return as prescribed, the filing of the return cannot be entertained. Since there was delay in furnishing the return, which was beyond the control of the petitioner, the same was rejected without taking into consideration the fact that the relief has been granted by the apex Court for condonation of delay. S.C. Mohanty, Senior Standing Counsel for the Income Tax Department vehemently contended that since there was delay on the part of the petitioner to furnish the return, therefore, the delay has not been condoned and the authority is well justified in passing the order impugned, which does not warrant interference of this Court at this stage. The bench noted that, ‚Äú it appears that the petitioner is a regular assessee before the opposite party-department. Even if the filing of IT Return was within his knowledge and was deriving income from sale of high speed diesel and income from firm‚Äôs business etc., he was required to file the IT Return disclosing the income at Rs.15,97,750/- and deposit of advance tax and all other dues of the department even if were paid to the credit of the IT Department and excess amount as per the statement prepared accrued the claim of refund at Rs.10,939/- and unless the return was entertained and delay is condoned considering the illness etc., it could not be possible to file IT Return in the relevant year. It was further noted that, ‚Äúwhen the petitioner submitted the IT return, the delay could have been condoned invoking Section 119 (2)(b) of the IT Act.‚Äù On the whole the deficiency in the return could not be complied and the and 3CD as prescribed for filing of the return was required to be uploaded by the Chartered Accountant which came to the notice of the petitioner for the uploading on 31.03.2022. Therefore, the illness of the petitioner as well as uploading of statutory made on 31.03.2022 by the concerned Chartered Accountant made the delay which was beyond the control of the petitioner, the bench noted. The division bench thus observed that, ‚ÄúAs such, the condonation delay application filed by the petitioner should not have been rejected straightway in a cryptic, confused and absurd manner without considering the orders passed by the apex Court as well as by this Court as mentioned above.‚Äù It was thus held that the order so passed by the Principal CIT, the opposite party no.2 dated 01.08.2023 under Annexure-1 cannot be sustained in the eye of law and the same is liable to be quashed and is hereby quashed. The Orissa High Court Bench of Justice and Justice G Satapathy remitted the matter back to the file of PCIT for fresh consideration, in view of the above. ¬© 2024 Taxscan ¬© 2024 Taxscan",

However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has denied the charge and termed it as a tactic of the 28-year-old comedian to gain cheap popularity. Yadav‚Äôs allegations have come after a notice issued against him by the administration in connection with a case lodged two months back over a dispute with a person at Pithampur, located 40 km from here in the district. Also Read Watch: Comedian Gaurav Kapoor‚Äôs hilarious take on eating healthy The notice has been issued against Yadav by an executive magistrate under Code Of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) section 107 (requiring to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond with a surety) for maintaining peace. Yadav, a resident of Pithampur, was among four persons arrested along with comedian Munawar Faruqui on January 1, 2021 following a complaint that objectionable remarks were made by the latter about Hindu deities during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore. The Indore bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court ordered the release of Yadav from jail on interim bail on February 26, 2021. In a post on Instagram late Sunday night, Yadav claimed, ‚ÄúIn my hometown, I have a new identity as an anti-nationalist. There are a few people who are relatives and known affiliates of the ruling party, who have been harassing my brother and me for three years now.‚Äù ‚ÄúAfter getting released from jail, I haven‚Äôt been home for more than three days in two years because some of the goons here were continuously harassing us,‚Äù he alleged. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Nalin yadav (@nalinsaaheb) When contacted, State BJP spokesperson Alok Dubey said that the comedian was carrying out a false propaganda against his party in a bid to get cheap publicity through social media. According to police officials, a person, Sawan Singh Dabar, had allegedly assaulted Yadav in Pithampur on March 24 this year over an ‚Äúold enmity‚Äù following which an FIR was registered against the former on charges of assault, abuse and issuing threats. Dabar had also lodged a complaint of assault against Yadav, they said. In view of the tension between Yadav and Dabar over the incident, the notice has been issued on an application of police, to both the parties to maintain peace. Yadav‚Äôs lawyer Ashar Warsi said legal options were being considered against the notice issued in the comedian‚Äôs name. Following a complaint by Nalin Yadav‚Äôs younger brother Akash, an FIR was registered at Sector Number-1 police station of Pithampur on November 21, 2023, against local residents Uday Raghuvanshi and Krishna Thakur on charges of assault, abuse and issuing threats ‚Äúover an old dispute‚Äù, officials said. The comedian has alleged that different people from the same group in Pithampur area were constantly harassing him and his younger brother.

        "content": "MAGA troll Sam Alito, having signaled his solidarity with Donald Trump‚Äôs insurrectionists by flying (or allowing to have flown) an upside-down American flag at his home, is disgracing the U.S. Supreme Court with his mere presence. That sentence barely scratches the surface. I need to elaborate. As the southern writer Flannery O‚ÄôConnor said long ago, ‚ÄúYou tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.‚Äù The story is that Alito, having openly trumpeted his bias in flagrant violation of every judicial code of ethics, deserves to be impeached. But since that certainly won‚Äôt happen ‚Äî there aren‚Äôt enough votes in the Senate, and the chamber‚Äôs Democrats are predictably too chicken to highlight the issue ‚Äî at minimum Alito should recuse himself from the long-awaited ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù ruling that could whitewash Trump‚Äôs criminal liability in the Jan. 6 insurrection. That won‚Äôt happen, either. The current high court is a sinkhole of mendacity, and its own ethics code has more holes than a slab of Swiss cheese. For instance: ‚Äúa justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the Justice‚Äôs impartiality might reasonably be questioned, that is, where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the Justice could fairly discharge his or her duties.‚Äù Alito can skirt that provision with ease. He can simply decide that none of his critics are ‚Äúunbiased and reasonable.‚Äù Even though a federal recusal law says that ‚ÄúAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,‚Äù Alito can simply decide for himself that his impartiality is being unreasonably questioned. So Alito is betting the story of his family‚Äôs stop-the-steal flag (and a second controversial flag flown at his Jersey Shore vacation home) will simply slide down the Orwellian memory hole, just like so many of MAGA‚Äôs fascist-adjacent perfidies. That wouldn‚Äôt happen if Senate Democrats raised hell and demanded Alito appear at a hearing to explain himself, but, as we know, Dems don‚Äôt do courage (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much to be gained with a hearing at this point,‚Äù said Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin). The result: Alito has free rein to make a mockery of the oath he took to ‚Äúfaithfully and impartially discharge‚Äù his duties under the Constitution. And we become further benumbed as this once-vibrant democracy sleepwalks toward dystopia. In just the latest example, a video on Trump‚Äôs social media account said if he‚Äôs elected, we will have the ‚Äúcreation of a unified Reich.‚Äù That video prompted this reaction from ex-Trump deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews, who said, ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs continued use of Nazi rhetoric is un-American and despicable. Yet too many Americans are brushing off the glaring red flags about what could happen if he returns to the White House. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.‚Äù But we were talking here about Alito. He went full MAGA last month during the oral argument about Trump‚Äôs fake ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù case ‚Äî he worried that a criminal prosecution of Trump might ‚Äúlead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy‚Äù ‚Äî and now he‚Äôs poised to vote on the ultimate ruling. There is one foreseeable ray of hope. It‚Äôs possible that he and Clarence Thomas (the other most detestably compromised justice) will be outflanked. A narrow court majority could rule that Trump‚Äôs Jan. 6 insurrectionist conduct does not shield him from criminal prosecution and that the trial currently in limbo can indeed proceed. Such a ruling wouldn‚Äôt remove the stain of Alito‚Äôs treasonous flag-waving, but it would arguably salvage the court‚Äôs credibility ‚Äî at least until the next scandal besmirches it.

        "content": "‚Äì As Company Commends Tinubu For CNG Initiative LAGOS ‚Äì The Federal Government has assured that it would avoid the non-inclusion of Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company Ltd (IVM) in the award of contracts for the production of buses as part of the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Initiative. This is as Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, the Chairman, Innoson Group, has commended President Bola Tinubu for the CNG Initiative following the removal of petrol subsidy. Mr. Ekperikpe Ekpo, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), gave the assurance over the weekend during a tour of the existing IVM factory complex in Nnewi, Anambra State and the multi-billion new IVM plant to be opened soon with an installed capacity to manufacture 30,000 CNG vehicles annually. The minister described the non-inclusion as a ‚Äúyesterday occurrence,‚Äù and encouraged Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, Chairman, IVM to continue to provide jobs to the teeming qualified people through his factories. Stakeholders and the public had criticised the Federal Government for not including Innoson Motors in the initial contracts when the names of the auto companies tasked with the supply of the CNG buses were made public. Innoson Motors had pioneered the manufacture of autogas vehicles, including buses of varied capacities, about two years ago, even before the coming onboard of this present administration. He said: ‚ÄúToday is a different day. I can assure you that we will make a move towards making amends from what has happened yesterday to make our person (referring to Dr. Innocent Chukwuma), proud of where he comes from, and that he is from Nigeria.‚Äù Besides, Ekpo expressed delight with Chukwuma for investing keenly in the manufacture of CNG vehicles and aligning with President Bola Tinubu‚Äôs commitment to using the CNG Initiative to dampen the effect of the removal of fuel subsidy on the masses. He said the massive production of vehicles that run on CNG by Innoson was giving a boost to the transition from petrol and diesel to gas. Ekpo also remarked that manufacturing activities at IVM were in line with the aspirations of Mr. President, stressing that the president would be delighted at the growth and expansion of the company. He reiterated that the plan of Tinubu for the use of CNG was to cut cost in the spending model of government and creating a greenhouse economy. ‚ÄúThe Chairman took me to observe the exhaust pipe and when I saw it, it was very clean and nothing came out of it, and it was in the condition that we will really appreciate. So, I am really happy to see what I am seeing at Innoson. And I give him kudos for identifying with the President as he did this morning with his comment on moving ‚Äúfrom gas to prosperity. By the special grace of God, we have a son of Nigeria who is making Nigeria proud in CNG vehicle production. When I return to Abuja, I will brief the president on what I have seen and what I have experienced. It is left for the President to take a decision on the direction to go. ‚ÄúThere is a presidential committee on CNG. I will equally collaborate and sit down with them and talk about the issue, because we are looking at how to cut costs, reduce expenses which will add value to our country, Nigeria. So CNG vehicles should be patronised from all angles and I believe the President will support such aspirations,‚Äù he added. In his reaction, Chukwuma echoed his belief that the exclusion from the contract awards for the CNG buses by the Presidential Committee should be regarded as a thing of the past and a mistake, while expecting a fairer process in the future. He expressed that may be the committee was not aware the extent IVM had gone in manufacturing CNG vehicles since 2022, but stressed that the committee was now more informed about the company‚Äôs activities. He added: ‚ÄúBut, it is not compulsory that they will use IVM to start the implementation of the CNG Initiative. They can use anybody‚Äôs brand to start. But, they will later understand the true position of things as time goes on. We are all working together to move the nation forward.‚Äù The Innoson Chairman also commended Tinubu for the CNG Initiative following the removal of petrol subsidy. He further lauded the president for directing government ministries and agencies to key in into the momentum for Nigerians to follow suit He said: ‚ÄúWe have confidence in President Tinubu because he knows how to handle any situation. He is an expert and he showed it in Lagos State as a governor. So, we still believe he will do it with Nigeria. ‚ÄúAll these things we are doing here are part of our efforts to support him, so that the government can be able to make Nigeria great. With all these things we are doing and everybody‚Äôs support, the president will surely make Nigeria great. I am building this new CNG factory now and the President is expected to commission it very soon.‚Äù One of the highlights of the minister‚Äôs tour was the demonstration of the fire-fightingchafacyetistucs of IVM fire trucks, and a segment-by-segment display of a wide range of IVM vehicles.",

Fury lost his undisputed heavyweight world title fight against Usyk in Saudi Arabia earlier this month despite dominating the first half of the fight. Usyk almost dropped his rival in the ninth round as he turned the bout on its head. And Fury's corner, including dad John, has been criticised after footage showed them telling their man he was in front and didn't need to seek a stoppage. As it was, only one judge agreed with the other two giving Usyk the nod. This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

        "content": "... The Great Ife Alumni Association, Osogbo branch has called on the Federal Government to suspend the increase in electricity tariff for customers, describing it as an additional burden on the masses. This is contained in a communique issues at the end of its meeting, a copy which was made available to journalists in Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Tuesday. In the communique jointly drafted by Revd. ‚ÄòLowo Adebiyi- Chairman, Mr Oluwamayowa Fagbohungbe, Secretary, Barr. Wuraola Ogunkola, member and made available to journalists urged the Federal Government to revert to status quo in the interest of the people. ‚ÄúDistinguished members of Great Ife(Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-Ife) Alumni Association, Osogbo Branch at its meeting of Tuesday 7th May 2024 deliberated on the increase in electricity tariff by the Federal Government through the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), its accompanied hardships on the people, coupled with the hardship faced by the electricity consumers in the reconfiguration/upgrading of some selected meter cards, and resolved as follows; ‚ÄúThat the Federal Government (FG) should suspend the electricity tariff increase forthwith and revert to status quo in the interest of the people. ‚ÄúThat the government after the suspension, organize public hearings in all the Six Geopolitical Zones of the Country where the planned electricity tariff increase will be exhaustively discussed and objectively assessed. ‚ÄúThe Meeting wondered why FG is still calling the shots in the nation‚Äôs electricity companies which have undergone privatization, calling on President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to right the wrongs in this important sector. ‚ÄúMembers were bewildered that despite the fact that the then Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) supplied metres that are still upgraded to inflict untold hardship on the people, querying the rationale for the reconfiguration/upgrading to take up to 3 or 4 months, before the process is completed, while energy consumers are denied the opportunity of buying energy during that long period of time essence of such upgrade. ‚ÄúThe Meeting equally wondered why our past is usually better than our present in Nigeria, with particularly reference to the Federal Ministry of Power as the last Hon. Minister of Power whose tenure is still a reference point till today is Prof. Bartholomew Nnaji, the Chairman CEO of the Geometric Power Limited, pleading with President Tinubu to appoint a professional with requisite technical competence and capacity as the Hon. Minister of Power. ‚ÄúThat President Tinubu should declare a state of emergency in the electricity sector with a view to achieving a total overhaul and clean up so as to purge the sector of corruption‚Äù.",

        "content": "A 54-year-old German army officer who confessed to spying for Russia has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison by a court in Dusseldorf. The man, a captain, had acknowledged betraying sensitive military information to the secret services. He also joined the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party around the same time he offered himself up to Russian intelligence. Prosecutors accused him of serving as an agent for a hostile, ruthlessly aggressive foreign power. German police officers arrested the man in Koblenz on August 9, and he has been held in custody since then. The incident was one of several Russian spy scandals that have rocked Germany in recent months and heightened concerns about security in the country. He faced a shorter prison sentence because the information he offered to the Russians was classified as official secrets. If he had also betrayed more sensitive state secrets, he could have faced more severe punishments, up to a life sentence. The captain had claimed that he was driven by fear of a nuclear escalation during Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. His defence lawyer argued that he began consuming fake news, propaganda and conspiracies on the social media platforms Telegram and TikTok during a difficult stretch of professional work. (IANS)",

        "content": "Dashing Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant revealed that he was reluctant to visit the airport after his life-threatening injury as he was apprehensive about facing people while wheelchair bound. The 26-year-old had suffered multiple injuries following a near-fatal car crash on the Delhi-Dehradun highway in December, 2022. He miraculously cheated death but the injuries required a major knee surgery and an extensive rehabilitation about which Pant has already opened up. ‚ÄúThe accident was a life-changing experience for me. When I got up after it, I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I would be alive, but God was very kind to save me,‚Äù Pant said on ‚ÄúDhawan Karenge‚Äù, a talk show hosted by India cricketer Shikhar Dhawan. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt go to the airport because I was nervous about facing people in a wheelchair. I couldn‚Äôt even brush my teeth for two months, and for six to seven months, I suffered unbearable pain,‚Äù Pant recalled. However, the flamboyant batter returned to action after 14 months in the recently concluded IPL, giving glimpses of his devastating best.",

        "content": "Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was not there in the Belgium provisional squad for Euro 2024 announced by Domenico Tedesco. Updated: May 28, 2024 2:58 PM IST By Thibaut Courtois was the major missing as head coach Domenico Tedesco announced Belgium‚Äôs provisional squad for the Euro 2024 to be held in Germany on Tuesday. Thus Belgium become the fifth team after European giants Italy, Germany, England and Spain to release their provisional squad. Although the reason for leaving out Courtois is not yet known, it is believed that he has just recovered a few days back from an ACL injury and has not attained match fitness. Apart from Courtois another notable omission has been Fenerbahce‚Äôs Michi Batshuayi. Tedesco would look to start things afresh after Belgium failed to win any silverware under Roberto Martinez with the so called golden generation of players they had. The squad was quite predictable with likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Thomas Meunier, Alex Witsel, Romelu Lukaku. Manchester City star Jeremy Doku has also been named in the squad. Belgium Provisional Squad for EURO 2024 Koen Casteels ,Thomas Kaminski, Matz Sels Timothy Castagne, Maxim De Cuyper, Wout Faes, Thomas Meunier, Arthur Theate, Jan Vertonghen, Zeno Debast Kevin De Bruyne, Orel Mangala, Amadou Onana, Youri Tielemans, Arthur Vermeeren, Axel Witsel, Aster Vranckx Jeremy Doku, Leandro Trossard, Romelu Lukaku, Yannick Carrasco, Johan Bakayoko, Charles De Ketelaere, Dodi Lukebakio, LoiÃàs Openda. They would look to improve on their World Cup showing in Qatar where they exited a group consisting Croatia, Canada and Morcco. They start their EURO 2024 campaign on 17 th June against Slovakia. They have been seeded in group E with Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia. For breaking news and live news updates, like us on or follow us on and . Read more on Latest on . Topics",

As per income tax rules, if a Permanent Account Number (PAN) is not linked with biometric Aadhaar, TDS is required to be deducted at double the applicable rate. Last month, the income tax department issued a circular stating that no action will be taken for short deduction of TDS in case the assessee links his/her PAN with Aadhaar by May 31. ‚ÄúPlease link your PAN with Aadhaar before May 31, 2024, if you haven't already, in order to avoid tax deduction at a higher rate,‚Äù the department posted on X. In a separate post, the I-T department asked reporting entities, including banks, forex dealers, to file SFT by May 31 to avoid penalties. ‚ÄúThe deadline to file SFT (Statement of Specified Financial Transactions) is May 31, 2024. Avoid penalties by filing accurately and on time,‚Äù the department said. The reporting entities which are required to file SFT returns with tax authorities include forex dealers, banks, sub-registrar, NBFC, post offices, issuer of bonds/debentures, mutual fund trustees, company paying dividend or buying back shares. These specified institutions are required to furnish the details of certain financial transactions or any reportable account registered/recorded/maintained by them during the year. Delay in filing of SFT returns may attract a penalty of up to Rs 1,000 for each day of default. Non-filing or filing inaccurate statement may also lead to levy of penalty. Through SFT, the income tax department keeps a track of high value transactions undertaken by an individual.",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines ‚Äì The Supreme Court (SC) has allowed the transfer of doomsday preacher Apollo Quiboloy‚Äôs cases from Davao City to Quezon City. The High Court announced on Tuesday, May 28, that the SC Second Division approved the Department of Justice‚Äôs (DOJ) request to move Quiboloy‚Äôs sexual and child abuse cases from Davao City to the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC). In April, the DOJ made the request to the SC ‚Äúso that the same team of prosecutors may be able to prosecute both cases together.‚Äù Aside from the Davao City cases, Quiboloy faces a non-bailable human trafficking case pending in Pasig City . In its request to the High Court to transfer Quiboloy‚Äôs cases, it said, ‚ÄúThe significance of the subject cases extends beyond the local context, touching on broader national policies, public interest, and security concerns.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe preservation of integrity of the proceedings as there is a likelihood of local biases potentially affecting the trial‚Äôs impartiality in Davao City,‚Äù the DOJ had also said in its request. In its order, the SC said it found compelling reasons to justify the transfer because the cases ‚Äúinvolve public interest, with the accused, a well-known religious leader, being influential in the area.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs this could cause local biases and a strong possibility that witnesses cannot freely testify due to fear and influence of the accused, the Court found it prudent and judicious to order the transfer of the cases to Quezon City,‚Äù the SC added. Davao City is Quiboloy‚Äôs turf ‚Äì his Kingdom of Jesus Christ‚Äôs compound is located in the city. The Quiboloy-founded church said it has 4 million followers across the country, and another 2 million overseas. Quiboloy is also a known ally of the Duterte family, which has great influence in Davao local politics. Former president Rodrigo Duterte‚Äôs sons are local officials: Sebastian is the sitting mayor, while Paolo is Davao City‚Äôs 1st District Representative. The fugitive also oversees the operation of Sonshine Media Network International, along with a string of radio stations, newspapers, and magazines. In its order, the SC also directed the Davao City court to forward the entire records of Quiboloy‚Äôs cases to the executive judge of the QC RTC. The QC court, meanwhile, was ordered to raffle the cases among its judges. ‚ÄúThe Court further directed judges in Davao City and in other stations in Mindanao where future related cases involving Quiboloy and his co-accused may be filed to motu proprio order the transmittal of the records to the Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC, Quezon City and Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, as the case may be,‚Äù the High Court added. For his alleged abuses, Quiboloy faces several cases in the country and abroad. Aside from local cases, Quiboloy is also wanted in the United States for sexual trafficking. He was indicted by a federal grand jury in a US District Court in Santa Ana, California, in 2021, and landed on the US Federal Bureau of Investigation‚Äôs most wanted list . The Senate had previously ordered Quiboloy‚Äôs arrest after the preacher was held in contempt for snubbing the summons of the Senate committee on women, children, family relations, and gender equality. In April, the DOJ said the fugitive remains in the country. Quiboloy has yet to be arrested despite the standing warrants against him. ‚Äì Rappler.com",

        "description": "The use of personal emails and deletion of messages have both caught the attention of the province's information and privacy commissioner, who has now confirmed she is investigating both.",
        "content": "The Ontario Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) is investigating Premier Doug Ford and his staff's use of personal emails and deleted messages about the Greenbelt scandal . The investigation follows the Ontario NDP's request for transparency in the Ford government's handling of the Greenbelt. The office currently has 19 active requests for records related to the Greenbelt, Patricia Kosseim, the province‚Äôs information and province commissioner, said in a response to the NDP. Many of them are related to issues the NDP raised. The IPC will also release a report on Greenbelt-related emails, documents, and the Ford government‚Äôs record-keeping, she said. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * Transparency in government actions and decisions is a fundamental principle that underpins the public‚Äôs trust in government, Kosseim added. Last year, the auditor general found that Ford government political staffers used personal email addresses to communicate with development lobbyists and allegedly deleted records regularly. The audit concluded that staff forwarded messages between personal and government accounts, violating provincial guidelines. The NDP says they welcome the special report, which will provide a clearer understanding of the government‚Äôs conduct. ‚ÄúWe have been deeply concerned by revelations of deleted emails, the use of personal accounts, and other apparent attempts to cover-up the government‚Äôs actions as it schemed to give preferential treatment to well-connected Greenbelt speculators,‚Äù said Marit Stiles, Leader of the Ontario NDP. ‚ÄúReports like these are rare and very serious.‚Äù New documents obtained through a freedom of information request by the Ontario NDP appear to reveal previously undisclosed meetings. These documents showed that Carlo Oliviero, former executive director of stakeholder relations for the premier‚Äôs office, used his personal email to set up a meeting with a developer about Hamilton land that was later removed from the Greenbelt. ‚ÄúThe walls are closing in for this government. One way or another, the truth about Ford‚Äôs Greenbelt dealings is coming out of the backrooms and into the light,‚Äù said Stiles. Ontario's information and privacy commissioner says she will also release a report on Greenbelt-related emails, documents and the Ford government‚Äôs record-keeping. #Greenbelt #onpoli Advocates also welcome the IPC probe, but expressed broader concerns. ‚ÄúThis is welcome news, but if this pans out, it will be yet another reason to suspect that the real motivations behind the Ontario government's sprawl-and-highways agenda bear no relationship to the ones it offers up in press conferences, in media releases,‚Äù said Phil Pothen, land use and land development program manager at Environmental Defence. ‚ÄúIt confirms, once again, that government political staff involved in land use planning and land development policy know that they have something to hide from normal disclosure processes.‚Äù Pothen told Canada‚Äôs National Observer that the investigation could have significant legal and political ramifications for the Ford government because ‚Äúthe government could be found in violation of the Information and Privacy Act and the information revealed could be useful for the ongoing RCMP investigation.‚Äù Pothen criticized the Ford government‚Äôs use of private emails and evasion of normal disclosure processes, which he believes damages public confidence in government decision-making. ‚ÄúEvading public scrutiny damages the public's confidence in government decision-making and makes them suspect favours are being done for well-connected people at the expense of the environment and the public,‚Äù Pothen said. Pothen pointed out potential legal implications, suggesting that if political staff used private email accounts to plan the Greenbelt changes and misled the public and ethics watchdogs, it casts doubt on the legitimacy of other government initiatives, such as forced boundary expansions and Highway 413. ‚ÄúEven without these revelations, a subsequent government would in our view have clear legal authority to reverse boundary expansions and greenfield development approvals made by any level of government under these new planning regimes,‚Äù he added. Further, any sprawl resulting from the government‚Äôs decisions ‚Äúshould come with a huge asterisk and be considered for revocation.‚Äù Last week, Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, requested an update from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on the ongoing investigation into the Greenbelt scandal. Canada‚Äôs National Observer reached out to Ford's office for comments, but did not receive a reply in time for publication.",

        "content": "Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services, says the First Nations Clean Water Act will be ‚Äúanother tool‚Äù for nations to curb environmental racism and protect their waters. Also known as Bill C-61, the bill proposes a new water commission, run by First Nations and funded by Ottawa. The commission will increase capacity to help First Nations monitor their water for pollution, Hajdu said. The bill will also mandate that Ottawa and the provinces and territories ensure stronger protections for bodies of water that feed into First Nations‚Äô lands and that First Nations have the same rights to quality of water as Canadian municipalities, Hajdu explained. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * ‚ÄúAnd of course, that is still not the case in many First Nations in this country,‚Äù she added. But Hajdu said Conservative conduct in the House over ‚Äúthe entire legislative process‚Äù is stalling the bill‚Äôs progress. Though she hopes to steer the bill into the committee process by the end of the June sitting period, Ottawa is still waiting for ‚Äúall-party collaboration,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt's obstruction of things that deeply matter,‚Äù Hajdu said. Last week, a study was released showing the mercury pollution in Grassy Narrows First Nation that dates back decades has been worsening. The mercury was initially dumped into the Wabigoon River by Dryden Chemicals Ltd. But in recent years, sulfur and organic compound discharge from the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has created a dangerous chemical reaction in the river, resulting in high levels of methylmercury, researchers from Western University said last Thursday. The levels of methylmercury ‚Äî the most toxic form of mercury, known to cause neurological issues, birth defects and more ‚Äî in the river's fish may be twice as high as they would be without the mill discharge, the researchers said. Bill C-61, the First Nation‚Äôs water bill, proposes a First nation water commission, run by First Nations and funded by Ottawa. The comission will increase capacity to help First Nations monitor their water for pollution, Hajdu said. #CanPoli ‚ÄúTrudeau has shown what he thinks about the community of Grassy Narrows through his procrastination and his words,‚Äù said Eric Melillo, Conservative MP for Kenora, the riding in which the First Nation resides. ‚ÄúHe is not worth the cost, delays, and inaction.‚Äù However, Hajdu called out Melillo for not asking questions about Grassy Narrows last week in the Indigenous and Northern Affairs committee. ‚ÄúWe've got Conservative MPs that are essentially standing up in the house asserting the rights of corporations to poison Indigenous Peoples,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think they are completely wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs emotional for me: I live on the side of a lake, I understand the connection that people have to water,‚Äù Hajdu, who represents Thunder Bay on the shores of Lake Superior, said. Grassy Narrows is the second instance of environmental racism to make headlines this spring. In April, heavy benzene pollution made members of Aamjiwnaang First Nation near Sarnia, Ont. fall ill. Those instances speak to a larger trend. In 2022, a massive oilsands tailings leak seeped into the waterways used by the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and Mikisew Cree First Nation. It wasn‚Äôt until February 2023 that the Alberta Energy Regulator warned the First Nations about the leak, while community harvesters continued to hunt and fish for the nine months it went unreported. ‚ÄúThe real tragedy of places like Grassy, Aamjiwnaang and the Athabasca region is that people didn‚Äôt know they were being poisoned,‚Äù Hajdu said. Bill C-61 is currently not the only legislation in the House intended to combat Canada‚Äôs continued legacy of environmental racism. Green leader Elizabeth May currently has a private members bill that seeks to address environmental racism. Bill C-226 is one Senate vote away from becoming law. May said it‚Äôs unclear when the vote will be held, but the bill is expected to pass. Once passed, the bill will require the federal government to examine the links between race, socio-economic status and environmental risk as well as compel the environment and climate change minister to develop a national strategy to address the harms caused by environmental racism . May hopes the passage of C-226 will ‚Äúresult in a meaningful change‚Äù to push beyond just talking about the issue. The bill will clarify the responsibility of governments to protect marginalized, racialized and Indigenous communities. ‚Äî with files from with files from the Canadian Press & Natasha Bulowski Matteo Cimellaro / Canada‚Äôs National Observer / Local Journalism Intiative",

        "description": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith might not like Justin Trudeau, but she needs him more than anyone else in Canada.",
        "content": "In Alberta, depending on which conservative politician you ask, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is everything from an authoritarian tyrant to an effete eastern elite. But if you asked Danielle Smith, and she was forced to tell the truth, she‚Äôd describe him in decidedly different terms. No, she may not like him ‚Äî but right now she needs him more than anyone else in Canada. That‚Äôs made abundantly clear in new polling from Janet Brown Opinion Research. It shows support for the governing UCP holding steady from the last election, while also indicating that a growing number of Albertans identify cost of living as one of their top concerns. Indeed, for the first time since she started asking this question in 2018, a majority of respondents (54 per cent) said it was ‚Äúsomewhat difficult‚Äù or ‚Äúvery difficult‚Äù to meet their monthly expenses. \"What really struck me about this poll were the economic numbers,\" Brown told the CBC. \"I don't usually see data change this dramatically year over year. This is not a flash in the pan. There has been a shift ‚Äî an important shift ‚Äî in the way people are feeling about the economy.\" And yet, there hasn‚Äôt been a similarly negative shift in support for the UCP government. Why? In a word: Trudeau. Smith‚Äôs remarkable rise from the political ashes was driven, in large part, by her ability to take the province‚Äôs pre-existing animosity for Trudeau and turn it up to 11. Her so-called ‚ÄúAlberta Sovereignty Act‚Äù made it clear that she was willing to take the fight against Ottawa to places other conservative politicians, from Jason Kenney to former finance minister and leadership contender Travis Toews, simply weren‚Äôt. She‚Äôs been campaigning against Trudeau‚Äôs policies and priorities ever since, whether it was during the 2023 provincial election that she won or the year-plus that has followed. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * So far, at least, it‚Äôs working. Despite increasing spending more quickly in her first two budgets than Rachel Notley did in all four of hers and doing decidedly un-conservative things like nationalizing companies and creating new crown corporations, Smith has avoided the internal schisms that divided her United Conservative Party in the past. And despite the cost of living rising more quickly in Alberta than anywhere else in Canada, she has similarly avoided the sort of blowback that Trudeau‚Äôs government is facing. Average hourly wages in Alberta are down 4.4 per cent since 2019 (by comparison, BC‚Äôs are up nearly 8 per cent) while inflation is now nearly a full percentage point higher than in the rest of the country. This is a testament to the power of the reality distortion field Smith has created with Trudeau. On any and every issue, it draws the attention of her supporters away from her own missteps and mistakes and focuses it on him. He is seen as the sole architect of their misfortunes, even when you can draw a much shorter and straighter line between them and UCP policies. Never mind that UCP policies directly contributed to record-high electricity prices , soaring insurance costs and the influx of new residents from Toronto and Vancovuer that are driving up rents and real estate prices. For most conservative Albertans, it‚Äôs still all Justin‚Äôs fault. But this only works as long as he‚Äôs occupying the prime minister‚Äôs office. If the next federal election produces a Pierre Poilivere government, that distortion field gets broken. Yes, there will be some people who continue to blame Trudeau for their woes, just as there are people who still blame his father for the troubles they experienced in the 1980s after he left office. But many more will re-examine whatever economic challenges they might be facing in a new light, one that directs far more of it towards Smith and her choices. Helping people connect the dots between their cost of living challenges and UCP policies has to be the Alberta NDP‚Äôs top priority once it concludes its leadership race in June. Without a Trudeau in Ottawa to distract Alberta voters from their more immediate realities, the provincial government‚Äôs mishandling of a bunch of key files will suddenly become far more politically relevant. That‚Äôs why, although she‚Äôll never actually admit it, Smith is probably rooting for Justin Trudeau in 2025 ‚Äî and why the Alberta NDP is silently pulling for Pierre Poilievre. As far as political bedfellows go, they don‚Äôt get much stranger than that.",

        "description": "A U.S. federal grant has helped bolster Electrified Thermal Solutions, which is manufacturing a new heat-conducive brick that the company's founders claim will dramatically reduce the fossil fuel needs for heating in heavy industry.",
        "content": "This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration Inside a cinder block office building perhaps best known for the Hindu temple and table tennis club next door, a startup company is testing what may be one of the hottest new developments in clean energy technology. At the back of a small warehouse laboratory buzzing with fans and motors, an MIT spinoff company called Electrified Thermal Solutions is operating something its founders call the Joule Hive, a thermal battery the size of an elevator. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * The Hive is a large, insulated metal box loaded with dozens of white-hot ceramic bricks that convert electricity to heat at temperatures up to 1800 degrees Celsius ‚Äî well beyond the melting point of steel ‚Äî and with enough thermal mass to hold the heat for days. As the price of renewable energy continues to plummet, one of the biggest challenges for the clean energy transition is finding a way to convert electricity to high-temperature heat so societies can stop burning coal or natural gas to power heavy industries. Another thorny issue is finding a way to store energy ‚Äî in this case heat ‚Äî for days when the sun doesn‚Äôt shine and the wind doesn‚Äôt blow. ‚ÄúIf you are running an industrial plant where you‚Äôre making cement or steel or glass or ceramics or chemicals or even food or beverage products, you burn a lot of fossil fuels,‚Äù Daniel Stack, chief executive of Electrified Thermal Solutions, said. ‚ÄúOur mission is to decarbonize industry with electrified heat.‚Äù The industrial sector accounts for nearly one-fourth of all direct greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., which drive climate change, according to the EPA . Thermal batteries powered by renewable energy could reduce roughly half of industry‚Äôs emissions, according to a 2023 report by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit, and its affiliated Renewable Thermal Collaborative. Additional emissions come from chemical reactions, such as carbon dioxide that is formed as an unwanted byproduct during cement production, and from methane that leaks or is intentionally vented from natural gas pipes and other equipment. The challenge to replacing fossil fuel combustion as the go-to source of heat is that there aren‚Äôt a lot of good options available to produce high-temperature heat from electricity, Stack said. Electric heaters, such as the wires that turn red hot in a toaster, work well at low temperatures, but quickly burn out at higher ones. Other less common materials, such as molybdenum and silicon carbide, can withstand higher temperatures, but are prohibitively expensive. The race to decarbonize heavy industry is heating up as MIT spinoff Electrified Thermal Solutions develops its heat-conducive bricks. #ClimateChange #CleanEnergy #Decarbonization As a grad student at MIT, Stack wondered if firebricks, the bricks commonly used in residential fireplaces and industrial kilns, could be a less expensive, more durable solution. Bricks do not typically conduct electricity, but by slightly altering the recipe of the metal oxides used to make them, he and ETS co-founder Joey Kabel were able to create bricks that could essentially take the place of wires to conduct electricity and generate heat. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no exotic metals in here, there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôll burn out,‚Äù Stack said, standing next to shelves lined with small samples, or ‚Äúcoupons,‚Äù of brick that he and his team have tested to find the ones with the best heating properties. Electrified Thermal Solutions takes in power from renewable sources, then stores it in firebricks that can heat up to 1800 degrees Celsius. Credit: Barry Chin/The Boston Globe One of Electrified Thermal Solution‚Äôs biggest champions is MIT nuclear engineering research scientist Charles Forsberg, Stack‚Äôs former thesis advisor and an advisor to the company. ‚ÄúI have no doubt that this is going to go commercial,‚Äù Forsberg, who, along with Stack and MIT holds the patent to the technology, said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 77, it‚Äôs just sort of an intuitive feel of 50 years in the game.‚Äù Forsberg said his only concern was whether Electrified Thermal Solutions would be the ones to bring the technology to fruition, noting that many clean energy technologies have been invented in the U.S. only to gain commercial success in China. Recent government funding has given the company a significant boost. In January, ETS received a $5 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to help build its first commercial-scale demonstration project at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, an independent organization that provides contract research and development services to government and industrial clients. The project will demonstrate how the thermal battery could provide high-temperature heat for a number of industrial processes, including cement manufacturing, which currently relies primarily on burning coal for heat. Massimo Toso, president and chief executive of Buzzi Unicem USA ‚Äî one of the largest cement producers in the U.S. and an industrial partner with ETS on the DOE grant ‚Äî praised the company‚Äôs thermal battery. ‚ÄúETS‚Äôs Joule HiveTM Thermal Battery is the first industrial heat decarbonization solution we have identified that could potentially enable us to cost effectively and completely eliminate the use of fossil fuels in our heating processes,‚Äù Toso said in a written statement. In March, Ashland, a specialty chemical manufacturer based in Wilmington, Delaware, was awarded up to US$35 million in a matching grant from the Energy Department to fund what would be the first commercial deployment of ETS‚Äôs thermal batteries. Joule Hives would be installed at Ashland‚Äôs ISP Chemicals plant in Calvert City, Kentucky that requires large volumes of high-temperature steam to run its operations. Curt Jawdy, a senior manager with the Tennessee Valley Authority, a partner on the grant and the local electric utility for Calvert City, said ETS‚Äôs ability to charge its thermal battery during off-peak hours allows industrial facilities to decarbonize without placing greater strain on the utility‚Äôs electric grid. Jawdy said he also liked the company‚Äôs technology. Electrified Thermal Solutions‚Äô electrically conductive bricks. Credit: Barry Chin/The Boston Globe ‚ÄúSimpler is always better,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe fact that the brick is also the heating element, and you just supply electricity to the brick itself, simplifies the system significantly.‚Äù The project would replace natural gas-fired boilers at the Calvert City plant with ETS‚Äôs thermal batteries. Air blown through the Joule Hive batteries would transfer flame-temperature heat to the boilers to generate steam. The project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with steam generation at the plant by nearly 70 percent, according to the DOE . In 2022, Ashland released 72,000 tons of carbon dioxide from burning natural gas at the plant, according to data the company reported to the Environmental Protection Agency. Those emissions are equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 17,000 automobiles, a significant source of climate pollution in a town of 2,500 people, the EPA says. The DOE grant would split the cost of the project with Ashland up to a total of $70 million. Ashland would oversee the installation of the thermal batteries at its facility, a process that would involve a certain amount of risk for such a first of its kind installation. Carolmarie Brown, a spokeswoman for Ashland, said the company is still evaluating the project. ‚ÄúThere are many factors driving the decisions we will make as we proceed,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúLarge scale decarbonization includes thorough evaluations of the options, projects and innovations to move forward, and we‚Äôre in the early phase of the process.‚Äù As Ashland continues to evaluate the project, Stack and colleagues are continuing to scale up their capabilities. From the company‚Äôs beginning in 2020, ETS has outsourced production of its electrically conductive bricks to an industrial brick manufacturer that follows ETS‚Äôs proprietary recipe. After several years placing orders for small test batches of bricks, ETS recently received its first multi-ton order. ‚ÄúNow, if you want two tons, [or, if] you want 2,000 tons, the manufacturer is ready to do that for us,‚Äù Stack said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre off to the races.‚Äù",

        "content": "Many governments, companies and communities are taking action to reduce their use of fossil fuels. The petroleum industry is responding to this threat by ramping up their campaigns to manipulate public opinion. People like to believe they aren‚Äôt susceptible to the dark art of marketing, but Canadian advertisers wouldn‚Äôt invest nearly $20 Billion dollars annually if it didn‚Äôt work. In the midst of a dangerously heating planet, something is shifting our opinion on climate change. We‚Äôre constantly finding reasons not to invest in urban densification, electric vehicles, clean electricity and energy efficiency. At the same time, we‚Äôre overestimating the economic importance of the petroleum industry. You may have heard recently that ‚Äúnatural‚Äù gas is a climate solution. You might support the lobbyists that are vilifying municipalities for wanting their buildings to be heated by cleaner and more efficient methods. Perhaps you think the Alberta War Room was justified in sending thousands of letters to Nanaimo city councillors when they voted to ban gas hookups for new buildings. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * The Alberta government recently spent $8 million on a nation-wide advertising campaign to scare Canadians into thinking renewable energy would quadruple their electricity bills and leave them freezing in the dark. The solution, of course, is Alberta‚Äôs cheap and reliable gas. It‚Äôs a travesty that political advertising is not held to the same standard of truth as commercial advertising. Honesty is optional whenever politics are at play, but when political advertising is used to promote commercial enterprises and industry groups, this free pass should no longer apply. Lobbyists also have free reign to spread misinformation in the media and in the back rooms of ruling governments. The result of their marketing effort is a growing desire to release Canadian petroleum producers from the shackles of Canada‚Äôs global commitment to treat climate change as a real emergency. A majority of Canadians are rightfully concerned about affordability. Conservative media, politicians and advertisers amplify these economic concerns and use them to turn us against taxes and government spending. A Conservative government will tell us the cupboards are bare and we can no longer afford policies to address the climate crisis or protect nature. History has demonstrated the effectiveness of propaganda and marketing unrestrained by the rules of ethical conduct. A 2018 article in Psychology Today discusses how ideological brainwashing leverages an existential fear and empowers the spread of anxiety-reducing ideas. People are witnessing climate destabilization, the collapse of biodiversity, ecosystem loss, war and social polarization. The resulting anxiety, depression and fear make us vulnerable to assurances that economic growth will eventually solve everything. People are enduring climate destabilization, the collapse of biodiversity, ecosystem loss, war and social polarization. Anxiety, depression and fear make us vulnerable to assurances economic growth will solve everything, writes @winexus #cdnpoli This soothing message is often followed by the assertion that burning more fossil fuels will lead to greater prosperity and help pay for technical solutions to global warming. Greenwashing rounds out the comforting fantasy by assuring us that Big Oil is working hard on the problem. Carbon capture will get us to net zero! We‚Äôre all going to be just fine. Natural gas was a clever rebranding of a fossil fuel that is essentially methane. Methane is a heat-trapping gas, eighty times more harmful than CO2, but let‚Äôs think of it as something pleasing and natural. Professional marketers are now pushing the narrative that methane is one of the world‚Äôs best climate solutions. It‚Äôs a bridge fuel ! At a major Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) networking event in April, Pierre Poilievre embraced the simplistic math being used to promote Canada‚Äôs liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a climate-saving miracle . We just need to get China and India to switch from coal-fired electricity to natural gas. What a great idea. Canada does nothing to honour its global commitment to reducing the country‚Äôs greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes a pile of money selling LNG and contributes to a massive reduction in CO2 emissions worldwide. This is music to the ears of the petroleum executives in the audience and sounds pretty darn reasonable to the average voter. The United States Energy Information Association (EIA) determined that switching from coal to natural gas electricity generation results in a 32 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions. This is significant, but it‚Äôs not enough to stop the arctic from melting . It would be a far better investment to add zero-emissions capacity in the form of wind, solar and energy storage. California is a clear example of how an electrical grid can operate reliably without a heavy dependence on natural gas. In April 2024, solar reached a new record by generating 86.4 per cent of electricity demand during the day and for several hours after sunset, battery storage was the largest source of supply to the California grid. The climate friendliness of gas-generated electricity was recently challenged by a new study out of Cornell University. The research indicated that upstream CO2 emissions and methane leaks from fracking , gas flaring , pipelines , compressing the gas into a supercooled liquid and shipping LNG around the world, exceeds the GHG emissions from burning the fuel to generate electricity. Methane leaks are self-reported by industry and their numbers are now being challenged by satellite-based monitoring systems. Methane may yet prove to be a greater source of planetary heating than coal, especially if you include methane emissions from the millions of furnaces, fireplaces, gas stoves, barbeques and associated delivery infrastructure. Does it make sense to ship LNG around the planet and build pipeline networks to feed electricity plants in India and China? Alternatively, these countries could use their wind and solar resources to meet the lion‚Äôs share of electricity demand while building a grid that isn‚Äôt reliant on foreign gas. Despite the promise of renewable energy and energy storage , the fossil fuel industry is spending heavily to spread misinformation about renewables and to fund politicians that will put up roadblocks to slow the energy transition. The only way to fight back is to reduce their capability to manipulate us. NDP MP Charlie Angus has proposed a ban on fossil fuel advertising . There are also a growing number of lawsuits seeking to make Big Oil accountable for their deceptive practices. A far more drastic measure would be to nationalize the world‚Äôs largest oil corporations and change their mandate from serving shareholders to serving the public good. This may eventually come to pass if fossil corporations fail to accept their responsibility to reduce production and stop trying to mislead us.

        "description": "The immigration minister has been under fire over a direction he issued last year that has been linked to several tribunal decisions allowing visa holders to stay despite committing serious crimes.",
        "content": "Home Affairs head Stephanie Foster has admitted her department failed to warn Immigration Minister Andrew Giles about a slew of legal challenges that saw a tribunal allow visa holders to stay in Australia despite committing serious crimes and free a detainee who allegedly went on to commit murder. The departmental secretary made the sensational admission before a parliamentary committee hours after the embattled minister revealed he was reviewing the controversial tribunal decisions and said he had called on his department to explain why he was kept in the dark about the legal challenges. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles faced a barrage of questions over a ministerial direction. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen ‚ÄúIt is correct that he wasn‚Äôt informed,‚Äù Foster told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday evening. ‚ÄúWe had agreed to a protocol with Minister Giles to bring to his attention cases of a particular nature ... and we did not adequately resource that function, and it was not being done in a timely way, and it has not advised Minister Giles of [those particular cases].‚Äù When Coalition senator James Paterson put to her that it was ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù the department failed to warn Giles, Foster agreed: ‚ÄúIt is, senator, and I regret very much that this has happened.‚Äù She said she became aware of the issue in the past few days following media coverage, blaming limited resources for the oversight. Foster said the failure was ultimately hers, adding the department was now throwing resources at the issue. Giles has been under fire from the Coalition over a ministerial direction he issued in January last year that has been linked to several decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal preventing foreign criminals with longstanding connections to Australia from being deported. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton asked Giles in parliamentary question time on Tuesday about the case of a New Zealand citizen who was allowed to stay in Australia despite raping his stepdaughter. Government lawyers had unsuccessfully argued for the man‚Äôs visa to be revoked. Giles told parliament he had cancelled the man‚Äôs visa and it had remained cancelled by Home Affairs until the tribunal overruled his decision. ‚ÄúNow, I believe it is a decision that should still be cancelled, and I advise the House also that I have prioritised a number of cases for urgent cancellation consideration,‚Äù Giles said. The government has been under constant attack since November over its handling of the fallout from the High Court‚Äôs landmark ruling outlawing indefinite immigration detention. This masthead revealed on Tuesday that almost one in five released detainees had been charged with fresh crimes since the court decision, which prompted questions about when the government would use as-yet-untested preventative detention laws to lock up those at high risk of offending again. The Greens and asylum seeker legal advocates have also accused the government of limiting supports to those sent into the community. Compounding Labor‚Äôs immigration woes, Giles faced a barrage of questions in parliament over the tribunal‚Äôs interpretation of ministerial direction 99, which says significant weight must be given to a person‚Äôs ties to Australia. The ministerial direction was issued on January 23, 2023 to assuage the New Zealand government‚Äôs concerns that its citizens were being deported in large numbers even when they had stronger ties to Australia than to New Zealand. Last week, it emerged that the tribunal had in April released former immigration detainee Emmanuel Saki, who was charged with murder the following month. The tribunal reinstated Saki‚Äôs visa on March 27, partly due to direction 99. Questioning Foster over the bureaucratic failure, Paterson said, ‚Äúsomeone has allegedly been murdered as a result of someone being released following a successful AAT appeal‚Äù, adding that normally would have triggered the minister‚Äôs intention to re-cancel the visa. Giles told question time he had since re-cancelled Saki‚Äôs visa, ‚Äúand as the matter is before the courts, I will say nothing more‚Äù. Giles has also issued a ‚Äúplease explain‚Äù to his department, and told parliament a number of cases before the tribunal were not raised with him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve asked the department for an explanation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy department is now looking at all these cases as a priority, and they are all under cancellation consideration. ‚ÄúDirection 99 did not, and does not, decrease the importance placed on expectations such as the ... protection of the community from crime. ‚ÄúThis, Speaker, remains unchanged under this government. Community safety remains the highest priority of this government, and I say again, these were decisions made by an independent tribunal.‚Äù Home Affairs‚Äô latest visa cancellation statistics show that, as of December 31, there was a significant reduction of visa cancellations on character grounds ‚Äì particularly for New Zealanders ‚Äì in the first six months of 2023-24. From 2019-20, when the Coalition deported 939 people on character grounds, numbers have plummeted by roughly 75 per cent post-pandemic, to 244 so far in the 2023-24 financial year. But a department spokesperson said the majority of cancellations were not subject to that ministerial direction. Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan has vowed to scrap direction 99 if the Coalition is returned to government. ‚ÄúWhen will Andrew Giles stand up and be accountable for his actions? How many visas is he looking at? When will he cancel them? Will he look at all relevant cases since January 23, 2023? Will he rescind ministerial direction 99? If not, why not?‚Äù Tehan said in parliament on Tuesday. Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor has successfully obtained a judgment in default (JID) from the High Court here against a TikTok account owner in a defamation lawsuit involving her looks. On Tuesday (May 28), Justice Ahmad Shahrir Mohd Salleh allowed Rosmah's application to enter a JID against defendant Ku Muhammad Hilmie Ku Din, who failed to enter an appearance in the case. The court also made an order for general, aggravated and exemplary damages to be assessed by the High Court at a later date. Rosmah was represented by lawyers Sureshmurti Ramani and Mohamed Baharudeen Mohamed Ariff. Rosmah filed the suit through Messrs Hafarizam Wan & Aisha Mubarak on Sept 19. She claimed that Ku Hilmie had uploaded a TikTok video on March 2 last year containing defamatory content against her. The wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak claimed the posting, in its ordinary or normal meaning, implied that she committed a sin, was linked to bomoh activities and Satan, had practised polytheism, and that she should repent. She said the TikTok post had prejudiced her reputation as the wife of a former prime minister of Malaysia and patron to charities. Rosmah claimed that as a result, she suffered criticism and that her reputation as a public figure was smeared. She sought general, aggravated and exemplary damages to be assessed by the court, and an injunction to stop Ku Hilmie or his assistants or agents from repeating the defamatory post, in addition to other relief deemed fit by the court. The injunction application, however, was withdrawn because of the non-appearance of the defendant.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 Mirai reports that the European Digital Markets Act has caused a 30% drop in Google Hotel Ads traffic and a 36% decline in direct bookings for EU hotels. Mirai, a leader in hotel technology solutions aimed at maximizing direct sales and minimizing distribution costs, has observed a significant impact from the European Digital Markets Act (DMA) on hotel direct sales. Mirai‚Äôs data reveals a 30% reduction in Google Hotel Ads traffic and a decline of up to 36% in direct bookings within EU markets affected by the DMA. The DMA, implemented between January 19 and March 7 this year, has introduced profound changes in Europe‚Äôs digital landscape, impacting hotels worldwide. In July 2023, the European Union identified six digital companies as ‚Äògatekeepers‚Äô: Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft (Windows). More recently, on May 13, the European Commission also designated Booking.com as a gatekeeper. For Google, this designation means it cannot feature its own vertical services, such as Google Maps, Google Flights, or Google Hotel Ads, in its search results pages (SERPs). Consequently, Google had to adjust its platform, including Google Hotel Ads, which has affected hotel visibility and direct sales. These changes present significant challenges for European hoteliers, who are experiencing decreased visibility and a reduced capacity to sell directly. This shift has increased their reliance on intermediaries, negatively impacting profitability. Furthermore, the altered presentation of hotel options on Google has degraded user experience, complicating the purchasing process. Javier Delgado Muerza, CEO EMEA at Mirai , said: ‚ÄúSince 2022, Mirai has been actively involved with this subject, working directly with the EU, Google, and the European hotel industry to ensure that the implementation of DMA is beneficial for the entire European hotel ecosystem and to find solutions that mitigate these negative impacts and promote a more balanced and competitive ecosystem. Therefore we are very disappointed that introduction of the DMA recently rather ironically and unfairly favours large US companies such as Booking Holdings or Expedia, whilst disadvantaging hotels. This contradicts the very principles of the anti-competitive laws they were hoping to bring in.‚Äù Mirai encourages concerned hoteliers to file formal complaints with the European Union‚Äôs Cabinet of Commissioner Thierry Breton, Internal Market ( [email protected] ), and HOTREC, the European association for hotels, restaurants, bars, and cafes ( [email protected] ).",

By Panos Mourdoukoutas Ph.D. @pmourdoukoutas Published 05/28/24 AT 5:09 AM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Flipboard Share on Pocket AFP Last week, Nvidia's stock soared past the $1,000 mark, propelling the company to a market valuation of $2.55 trillion. This places Nvidia among the world's most valuable companies, competing with giants like Apple and Microsoft. The surge in stock value has sparked a debate about the true worth of the company's shares. The Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor company is the leader in designing graphics processing units (GPUs). These products power one high-growth industry after another, from gaming to cryptocurrencies to professional visualization and data centers. Nvidia also designs system-on-a-chip units for the fast-growing mobile computing and automotive market and develops software technologies such as CUDA. In addition, it has made remarkable advancements in AI and deep learning through its GPUs, with broad applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles. Nvidia's leadership in these high-growth industries has resulted in robust revenues and earnings reports, including one last week. For the first quarter ending April 28, 2024, it reported revenues of $26.0 billion, up 18% from the previous quarter and 262% from a year ago. GAAP earnings per diluted share came at $5.98, up 21% from the prior quarter and 629% from a year ago. Then there's the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, 2024, when revenues were $22.1 billion, up 22% from the previous quarter and 265% from a year ago. Earnings per share were $4.93, up 33% from the prior quarter and 765% from a year ago. \"Death, taxes, and NVDA beat on earnings,\" said Ryan Detrick, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, commenting on Nvidia's recent earnings. \"Even in the face of huge expectations, the company once again stepped up and delivered. The always-important data center revenue was strong, while future revenue was impressive. Bottom line, the bar was high and cleared once again.\" \"Nvidia delivered a strong beat-and-raise as AI visibility continues to grow and Hopper demand remains robust amidst growing competition and supply chain obstacles,\" said Ido Caspi, Research Analyst for Global X. \"This is evidenced by the 427% YoY revenue growth Nvidia delivered in its data center segment. The ongoing Hopper demand should help alleviate investor concerns about customers potentially delaying purchases in anticipation of the Blackwell transition,\" Caspi added. Caspi is impressed by the company's gross margins of 78.4%, up 13.8 percentage points year-over-year. \"This increase reflects the pricing advantages Nvidia holds across its chip lineup, even amidst growing competition,\" he said. \"We believe Nvidia's dividend increase signals to investors that they're serious about continued profitable growth in the quarters ahead and returning value to shareholders as the Blackwell transition plays out.\" Still, there's valuation. At the current market valuation of $2.55 trillion, Nvidia's stock is worth close to 9% of the U.S. GDP. \"Does it mean that the company's shares are overvalued? Well, that really depends on the valuation model used.\" My Columbia University students, Yiwen Yin and Gloria Zhu, used four models in a research report. First is the EBITDA Multiple Valuation, a company's operational profitability measure. It yields a value of $1359 per share, close to 30% above the current valuation. Second is the Price/Earnings Multiple Valuation, which focuses on net earnings. It yields $4294 per share, close to 400% above the current valuation. Third is the Perpetuity Growth Method, which considers the company's cash flow growth into perpetuity. It yields a value of $406 per share, close to 60% below the current price. Fourth is the Discounted Economic Value Added (DEVA) Method (R&D-Adjusted). It yields a value of $152 per share, close to 75% below the current price. The problem with these estimates is that they are sensitive to the assumptions made about the company's future financial performance, especially the top-line growth, which depends on the size of the demand for Nvidia's products and the company's ability to keep ahead of the competition and charge premium prices. Philip Panaro, Founder and former CEO of Boston Consulting Group Platinion, provides a technology perspective on Nvidia's growth and how it is tied to the continued explosive growth in AI technology. \"The stock is cheap at the current price given we are 'in the first inning of the growth of AI and the multi-trillion dollar transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 globally,'\" he said, adding, \"As a result, NVDA can reach over $8,000 a share by 2030 if it continues to align with the global growth of AI & Web 3.0.\" Caspi doesn't assign a valuation number to Nvidia's shares. However, he firmly believes that with strong demand drivers and competition years behind, Nvidia can confidently defend and maintain its market share, thereby sustaining its pricing power. \"Big Tech's capital expenditure remains exceptionally high given how early we are in the generative AI investment cycle,\" he said, adding, \"Despite efforts to explore alternative or in-house chips, their options are limited by supply constraints and the challenge of surpassing Nvidia's proven performance.\" (Disclosure: The author owns shares of Nvidia.) ¬© Copyright IBTimes 2024.

        "content": "Caretaker infrastructure minister Mark Harbers is introducing stricter rules for driving schools to improve test results and make new drivers safer. ‚ÄúExam fraud, instructors who deliberately register clients for tests too early and special deals which suggest a fast track to a driving licence are all examples of practices that need to go,‚Äù Harbers said. Currently just over half of candidates pass their physical driving test the first time around while just 39% pass the theory test. This prompted the ministry to set up a commission made up of driving school representatives, exam institutes CBR and IBKI and exam experts to review the process and to monitor its progress. Under the new rules, lessons will be obligatory and candidates can no longer apply for a test based on experience gained elsewhere. They will also have to learn several additional skills, such as driving in the dark and driving at 130 kph. A social behaviour test will also become part of the package, the minister said. Driving instructors will have to have a diploma from an accredited training institute and will have to do both tests every five years. Instructors who fail the tests three times will lose their licence. The stricter rules may lead to more expensive lessons but that will be offset by leaner drivers being more likely to pass, Harbers said. ‚ÄúWe expect that the new rules will result in more people passing their driving test in one go,‚Äù he said.",

        "description": "Alleged corruption is how Starlink received its approval to operate in Zimbabwe, according to several reports.The post Starlink muddies itself with unscrupulous Zimbabwe President deal appeared first on Hypertext.",
        "content": "Starlink has been given the go-ahead to operate in Zimbabwe by its president, Emerson Mnangagwa. A report alleges that Mnangagwa side-stepped regulatory approval to launch Starlink in the country. The company that will be Starlink‚Äôs ‚Äúsole and exclusive‚Äù partner in Zimbabwe is owned by one of Mnangagwa‚Äôs close friends. There are now eight African nations that offer Starlink to customers as Zimbabwe‚Äôs President Emerson Mnangagwa fast-tracked a deal that sees the Elon Musk-owned satellite internet provider launch in the country via IMC Communications. IMC Communications is a local Zimbabwean company owned by Wicknell Chivayo. Several publications have reported that the country‚Äôs telecom regulator the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (POTRAZ) has licensed Starlink to operate in Zimbabwe, as per Mnangagwa‚Äôs announcement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased to announce that I have approved the licensing of Starlink by POTRAZ to provide advanced internet and related digital processing services in Zimbabwe through its sole and exclusive partner, IMC Communications (Pvt) Ltd,‚Äù wrote Mnangagwa on X. A report from The Zimbabwean alleges that this claim is untrue, and in fact, POTRAZ is still deliberating on licensing Starlink in the Southern African nation. Not only that, but sources within POTRAZ expressed surprise to the publication that the president made the announcement without receiving the go-ahead from the regulator. ‚ÄúWe at POTRAZ are still deliberating on Starlink,‚Äù a source told The Zimbabwean, adding that the application for Starlink to enter the country was ‚Äúhighly technical and requires meticulous analysis.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe need to be confident that Starlink has given us all the key information and data before we can make a decision. That is why it is taking long to make a decision,‚Äù another source at POTRAZ said. POTRAZ is now apparently concerned that the approval for Starlink to launch in the country was given via social media, while it should have gone through all the formal processes before licensing and launching. In a South African context, this would have been like if President Cyril Ramaphosa had side-stepped ICASA‚Äôs many regulatory policies and approved Starlink to operate locally. Also, if Ramaphosa had made one of his companies Starlink‚Äôs ‚Äúsole and exclusive‚Äù partner as it is alleged that Wicknell Chivayo is a close friend of Mnangagwa. According to TechZim , Chivayo‚Äôs company, IMC Communication, doesn‚Äôt even have a functional website yet was awarded the Starlink partnership without any formal processes. ‚ÄúThere is a lot more on this website to suggest that it was hurriedly constructed to be up in time for today‚Äôs announcement,‚Äù the publication writes. Adding that some links are broken, and others lead to placeholder text. Clicking on ‚Äòbroadband‚Äô or ‚Äòsatellite tv‚Äô leads you to the generic ‚ÄòHello WPHix‚Äô page. We checked the website out , and it looks like a generic template, purported to be from a firm called ‚ÄúEtudes Architecture‚Äù which is a placeholder name. We also can‚Äôt find any offers to subscribe to Starlink at all. TechZim says that IMC is offering the Starlink kit for $650 (US), and there are three tiers of subscriptions: $38 a month for 50Mbps, $45 for 100Mbps and $85 for 1000Mbps. A World Bank report from 2021 suggests that only around 35 percent of Zimbabweans have access to the internet, so hopefully the availability of Starlink kits will aid those even in the most rural areas, despite the dodgy situation around its launch.

The David Metcalfe actor, 44, met Charley on the Dales set and started dating in 2007 before confirming their split last year. During Monday‚Äôs Loose Women , Matthew told the panel how life has been post separation. ‚ÄòI think we are still finding our way,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI mean the good thing is me and Charley are best mates and that is fantastic.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòIt is still new to us at the moment but we are still kind of finding our feet, and finding a way to do it well. And I think we are.‚Äô Back in November, Charley and Emmerdale co-star husband Matthew shared a joint statement on Instagram to confirm their separation , which presented a united front. ‚ÄòIt is with love and respect that Matthew and I have decided to separate. We remain friends and our priority is the love for our children. For their sake, we would appreciate privacy at this time,‚Äô Charley‚Äôs post read. While Matthew posted an almost-identical paragraph but swapped his own name for Charley‚Äôs name. Last Christmas the mum-of-three was showing support for Matthew as she took their children to see him in the production of Elf the Musical. The actress shared a handful of pictures on her social media capturing the evening, with one image showing Charley and her children in the car, and another with them in the theatre.

Matthew left his role as David Metcalfe in Emmerdale at the end of last month. The shop owner chose to depart life in the Dales and move to London, where his daughter Amba and her mum Priya Sharma (Fiona Wade) currently live . David‚Äôs decision came after he learnt that his son Jacob Gallagher ( Joe-Warren Plant ) was in a relationship with Victoria Sugden ( Isabel Hodgins ), David‚Äôs ex.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) ‚Äî Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday picked up a second $1 billion promise of military aid in as many days for his war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defense system, which Zelenskyy sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. A day earlier, Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary‚Äôs objections to the bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia‚Äôs 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros ($7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia‚Äôs staunchest ally in the 27-nation bloc. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine‚Äôs defense efforts. Zelenskyy met with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the NATO alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. Advertisement Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built ‚Äúin a short time frame.‚Äù The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. ‚ÄúUkraine is also fighting Europe‚Äôs fight,‚Äù she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose swift distribution of centralized EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. ‚ÄúWe need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,‚Äù Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters ahead of the meeting. ‚ÄúThe urgency is very, very acute.‚Äù Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia‚Äôs response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine‚Äôs biggest military test since Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia‚Äôs bigger army and air force.",

Inheritance solid applications, while giving center functionalities, frequently battle to stay up with advancing business needs. Incorporating new highlights or functionalities can be a lumbering cycle, preventing development and readiness. Enter composable engineering ‚Äì a particular methodology that dismantles applications into reusable, free parts. This article investigates the groundbreaking force of composable design and how low-code advancement stages can smooth out the progress for ground breaking associations. The Monolithic Maze: Challenges and Limitations Monolithic applications, while familiar, present several significant challenges for modern businesses: Limited Flexibility: Firmly coupled codebases make it hard to adjust or present new functionalities without affecting the whole framework. This rigidity impedes the capacity to adjust to changing business sector requests and incorporate new innovations. Scalability Bottlenecks: Scaling the whole application becomes unwieldy, frustrating development, and upsetting the reception of new advancements. This can prompt failures and botched open doors. More slow Advancement Cycles : Coordinating new highlights or functionalities can be tedious and asset-concentrated, dialing back development. This can smother an association‚Äôs capacity to remain serious in a quickly developing business sector. Maintenance Headaches: Fixing bugs or refreshing individual parts requires adjusting the whole application, prompting longer personal time and higher upkeep costs. This can essentially affect functional proficiency and productivity. These constraints can smother a business‚Äô capacity to adjust to changing business sector requests and gain by new open doors. Composable Architecture: A Modular Path to Agility Composable design offers a convincing arrangement. It dismantles applications into free, reusable parts ‚Äì the structure blocks of usefulness. Every part typifies explicit functionalities and speaks with others through clear-cut APIs. This approach flaunts a few benefits: Enhanced Flexibility: Individual parts can be effectively supplanted, refreshed, or incorporated with new ones, encouraging nimbleness and responsiveness to evolving needs. This permits organizations to adjust rapidly to showcase requests and quickly take advantage of new chances. Further developed Adaptability: Parts can be scaled freely to oblige fluctuating client volumes or explicit usefulness requests. This takes into consideration effective asset designation and cost improvement. Faster Innovation Cycles: New functionalities can be created and incorporated by trading or adding parts, speeding up development cycles. This enables organizations to remain on the ball and convey new highlights and administrations to clients quicker. Reduced Maintenance Costs: Detached parts are simpler to investigate, fix, and update, bringing down generally support costs. This works on functional proficiency and opens up assets for additional essential drives. The Low-Code Advantage: Democratizing Composable Development Low-code development platforms (LCDPs) empower businesses to transition to composable architecture in several ways: Rapid Component Development: LCDPs offer simplified functionalities and pre-constructed parts, empowering quicker improvement of reusable parts contrasted with customary coding strategies. This fundamentally lessens improvement time and related costs. Citizen Developer Participation: Business clients can use low-code stages to construct or tweak parts, extending the improvement pool past customary IT groups. This cultivates a culture of development and cooperation. Decreased Improvement Expenses : Quick advancement with pre-fabricated parts essentially lessens improvement time and related costs. This takes into consideration proficient asset distribution and a further developed project return for the money invested. Simplified Integration: Low-code stages frequently give worked-in combination capacities, improving on the most common way of associating parts with strong APIs. This smoothes out advancement and guarantees consistent correspondence between parts. Building a Composable Enterprise: A Strategic Approach Transitioning to a composable architecture requires a well-defined and strategic approach: Inventory and Analysis : Recognize inheritance applications and functionalities appropriate for componentization in light of reusability and expected benefits. This investigation ought to be directed with input from both IT and business partners to guarantee arrangements with business targets. Component Design: Obviously characterize the reasons, functionalities, and APIs of every part to guarantee a predictable and consistent mix. This incorporates laying out coding norms and programming interface plan rules to guarantee part quality, security, and viability. Standardization and Governance: Lay out coding principles, programming interface plan rules, and administration strategies to guarantee part quality, security, and consistency. This incorporates laying out a focal vault for putting away, forming, and overseeing reusable parts, working with access and reuse all through the association. Component Repositories: Make a focal storehouse for putting away, forming, and overseeing reusable parts, working with access and reuse all throughout the association. This can be a cloud-put-together store or a concerning start arrangement relying upon the association‚Äôs security prerequisites and framework. A Step-by-Step Guide: Transitioning with Low-Code Prioritization and Scope: Spotlight on deteriorating explicit functionalities inside inheritance applications that offer the main business esteem and have high reusability potential. This prioritization ensures. This prioritization guarantees engaged and practical progress, conveying early wins and gathering speed for additional composable improvement drives. Component Development and Modernization: Influence low-code stages to foster new parts or modernize existing functionalities inside heritage applications . Use pre-assembled parts where conceivable and comply with laid out plan principles and programming interface rules. Integration and Testing: Coordinate recently evolved or modernized parts with existing frameworks utilizing distinct APIs. Direct thorough testing to guarantee consistent correspondence and usefulness between parts. This might include unit testing of individual parts, coordination testing to confirm correspondence among parts, and framework testing to approve the general usefulness of the made application. Organization and Observing: Send the composable application in a staged methodology, beginning with non-basic functionalities. Ceaselessly screen the exhibition and dependability of the framework, address any issues immediately, and accumulate criticism from clients. Continuous Improvement: The composable engineering venture is a continuous interaction. Influence input and developing business needs to distinguish new functionalities for componentization and persistently work on the general design for upgraded nimbleness and future sealing. Conclusion Progressing to composable engineering with low code enables organizations to open a scope of advantages. Expanded adaptability, quicker development cycles, and further developed versatility make for a more light-footed and versatile IT scene. Resident designers can add to the improvement interaction, encouraging a culture of development and coordinated effort.

        "content": "THE best airline in the world for 2024 has been announced, with a different carrier taking over top spot this year. Last year Air New Zealand was voted number one, but it's been replaced in this year's list, published by A irlineRatings.com . 6 Qatar Airways has been named the best airline in the world for 2024 Credit: Reuters 6 The airline's business class suites have earned it lots of praise 6 The Qsuites provide a la carte dining and lie flat beds Credit: Reuters 6 The airline overtook Air New Zealand to claim top spot in the 2024 list Credit: AP The airline safety and product rating website has chosen Qatar Airways as Airline of the Year for 2024. The Airline Excellence Awards are published each year, and are judged by five editors with more than 100 years of industry experience between them. The carriers are judged on 12 key criteria, including fleet age, passenger reviews , profitability, safety rating, product rating and innovation among others. Although it was a close-run race this year, passenger feedback swung it in favour of Qatar. AirlineRatings.com Editor-in-Chief Geoffrey Thomas said: ‚ÄúIn our objective analysis Qatar Airways came out number one in many key areas although it was a very close scoring for the top ten. ‚ÄúThe passenger reviews however scored Qatar Airways ahead of all airlines and its consistency and high standard of service delivery came through in the feedback.\" It wasn't the only award that Qatar Airways picked up either, with the carrier also bagging Best Business Class for the fifth year running. It also picked up the Best Catering award because of the food it serves on board.

First and business class passengers are able to choose when they eat from the on-demand aÃÄ la carte menu. New rapid boarding technique splits family and friends The airline offers \"spacious dining areas at each seat,\" where people can \"savour your meal while relaxing in the utmost comfort\". Passengers are especially fond of the airline's Qsuites, found on their new Airbus A350-1000 planes, as well as some of their A350-900s, Boeing 777-300ERs and Boeing 777-200LRs. In addition to the AirlineRatings award, the suites have also earned it the title of World‚Äôs Best Business Class at the Skytrax World Airline Awards for the last five years. They claim to be the first-ever business class suites with doors to provide an extra layer of privacy for passengers. Sun Travel's Review of Qatar Airways Sun Travel's deputy editor Kara Godfrey reviewed Qatar Airways' business class Qsuite. This is what she made of her experience. \"I was lucky enough to recently be invited onboard with Qatar Airways, to try out their Qsuite Business Class - and I'm not sure how I will ever go back to economy. \"Feeling more like First Class, it often dominates other airlines when it comes to awards. \"Most business class seats have lie-flat beds, three-course meals and some extra privacy. \"But the Qsuite felt like a hotel on a plane - having its very own private door you can close. \"Along with the high walls around you, it felt like you were in a little bedroom, where no one can see inside. \"The cabins run with a 1-2-1 format, so if in the middle you can pull the middle wall down if travelling with a companion, although I opted for a window seat. \"The lie-flat bed was obviously fantastic, with a cosy fleece blanket and pillow, as well as White Company pyjamas. \"Despite nearly seven hours on a plane, I didn't want it to be over, and was almost sad to be arriving in Doha.\" Behind the doors, they can find ambient mood lighting, fully lie-flat beds and generous storage space. It even offers a bespoke turndown service, complete with pillows, a quilted mattress and a soft, plush blanket. Passengers are gifted The White Company sleepwear and slippers to help them get more comfortable in their beds. Additionally they're treated to a bespoke Diptyque branded amenity bag, and a lavish bespoke Diptyque gift box. Inside these kits, they'll find Diptyque lip balm, body lotion, face cream and an exclusive fragrance from their illustrious collection.

With a little over three weeks left before the ongoing session of parliament draws to a close on June 23, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle agreed to expedite discussions and clear the path for a formal approval in the Lower House. However, as previous discussions have shown, lawmakers remain far apart on some contentious issues ‚Äî namely the handling of corporate donations and fundraising parties ‚Äî and whether they‚Äôll be able to craft a bill that accommodates all the parties involved remains unclear.",

        "content": "golf game with former US President turned into a surreal experience, complete with snipers and an entourage of security. The footie ace, 38, who has recently taken the reins at Plymouth Argyle, found himself under the watchful eyes of sharpshooters as he played 18 holes alongside the controversial political figure. The bizarre pairing happened while Rooney was living it up in Washington DC, having taken his talents across the pond in 2018 to play for DC United. During his American adventure, Rooney, who left for the second time, banged in 23 goals in 48 games for the MLS side. The Daily Star is now on WhatsApp and we want you to join us!

Joining the duo on the green was none other than former New York Mayor Rudi Guiliani. This star-studded round of golf gave Rooney quite the story to share with Gary Neville : \"Donald Trump. The maddest thing about it was we had [Rudi] Guiliani in the buggy behind us, then there were about 50-100 golf buggies that were all security.\" \"There was a boat in the lake with snipers, there were snipers in the bushes, and I was like 'what's going on here?\" Rooney's chance to tee off with the ex-Apprentice star and business mogul came through a connection with Trump's son and even scored him a trip to the Oval Office, reports . Rooney narrated: \"I went in, he asked me to give his son football lessons. He said 'do you want to see my dad?' Took me into the oval office. From there his PA just texted, 'do you want to play golf?\" On another topic, Rooney announced his pick in the ongoing debate of who between and is the greatest player of all time. Favouritism for his ex-team-mate did not sway his choice. He declared: \"I think Messi, I think he's the best ever. I get a lot of stick for saying Messi. I understand people can say Messi or Ronaldo, they're both incredible, probably the best two players to play the game. For me, Messi has just got that little bit more flair which I like in a player.",

        "content": "21 May, 2024 IGAD Press Release96 21st May 2024, Juba, South Sudan: The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) issued the June to September 2024 seasonal forecast indicating an increased likelihood of above-normal rainfall over most parts of the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA). The areas expected to experience these above-normal conditions include Djibouti, Eritrea, central and northern Ethiopia, western and coastal Kenya, much of Uganda, South Sudan, and Sudan. On the other hand, parts of northern Somalia, isolated areas over western Ethiopia, and north-western South Sudan are expected to experience drier-than-normal conditions. The climate patterns in the JJAS 2024 period closely resemble those of 1998 and 2010, both of which experienced wetter-than-normal conditions over much of the region. An early to normal onset is expected in several parts of the region including central and northern Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, and South Sudan. However, a delayed onset is likely in Djibouti, parts of eastern and western Ethiopia, central and western Sudan, and southern South Sudan. The temperature forecast shows a probability of warmer-than-normal conditions across the region, particularly over northern Sudan, central and western Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanzania. Dr. GuleidArtan, ICPAC‚Äôs Director noted that ‚ÄúThe Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) stands as a region that is highly susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change, which pose significant challenges to the resilience of our communities. The forecasted wetter-than-normal conditions for June to September 2024 echo the patterns of 1998 and 2010, highlighting the level of impact especially for South Sudan and Sudan, which may experience impacts of floods.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs we observe these recurring extreme climate events, it is important to acknowledge the pivotal role played by early warning systems which serve as key instruments of preparedness, guiding us through climate variability. Through our operations, ICPAC continues to provide actionable climate information that is relevant and key for Early Action,‚Äù he added. In line with the World Meteorological Organization‚Äôs guidelines and recommendations, ICPAC has adopted an objective seasonal forecast method to generate climate forecasts for the Greater Horn of Africa. May 2024 initialized seasonal forecasts from 9 Global Producing Centers (GPCs) were utilized and processed to develop the June ‚Äì September 2024 seasonal climate outlook. The seasonal forecasts and their hindcast data were analyzed to provide a probabilistic forecast indicating the likelihood of above-normal, normal, or below-normal rainfall.",

The strike, which Gaza medics said also left hundreds of civilians with shrapnel and burn wounds, drew condemnation from world leaders and was set to be discussed at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council from 1915 GMT. The sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to push on with the military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages. More air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including Rafah's Tal Al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. \"The situation is very dangerous,\" said one resident, Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft. \"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said, referring to a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\". More than seven months into the bloodiest ever Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder international opposition, as well as cases against the country and its leader before two international courts based in the Netherlands. In a landmark political move on Tuesday, Spain as well as Ireland and Norway were to formally recognise Palestinian statehood, a step so far taken by over 140 UN members but few Western governments. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on national television that \"recognition of the state of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\". \"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security.\" Israel has slammed the announced move as a \"reward\" for the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement that rules Gaza, and earlier recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo. Foreign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on social media platform X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\". He also drew a parallel between Spanish minister Yolanda Diaz on the one hand and Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei and Hamas Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar on the other, following her call for a free Palestine \"from the river to the sea\". The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The Sunday night attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" in the city and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The resulting civilian toll in Gaza prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\". Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, said on Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\". The EU's foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\". A US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\". China voiced \"its grave concern over the ongoing Israeli military operations in Rafah\". Adding to the already heightened tensions, both the Israeli and Egyptian militaries on Monday reported a \"shooting incident\" that killed one Egyptian guard in the border area between Egypt and the southern Gaza Strip. Both forces said they were investigating.

        "content": "The return of the sunny weather we‚Äôre all spending a lot more time outside, but even the most diligent SPF appliers can end up feeling the effects of spending all day in the sun. As we get more exposure to UVA and UVB rays, our skin can be left feeling tight, dry and sensitive at best, and sunburnt at worst, which is why tailoring your summer skincare routine to the elements is essential. For many shoppers, that‚Äôs meant including the CureÃÅl Deep Moisture Spray for Dry Sensitive Skin, ¬£19.50 here , in their daily routines, with plenty praising it for how well it helps heal and soothe tight, sore and even burnt skin. The ultra-hydrating mist has even been called a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù by some thanks to how quickly it hydrated their skin. CureÃÅl's Deep Moisture Spray is a game changed for sore, burnt summer skin ( Image: CureÃÅl) The moisturising spray comes from Japanese brand CureÃÅl, which specialises in dry and sensitive skincare. Its products are formulated with a special ceramide-rich system that helps not only hydrate your skin, but protect and build up your complexion‚Äôs barrier too. Perfect for getting an instant hit of hydration, the spray can be used on both your face and your body to help tackle any areas that are feeling the effects of too much sun. It contains a blend of moisturising ingredients and ceramides which work together to help nourish your skin and balance its pH levels effectively. By applying it in a mist formula, rather than the usual creams or lotions, it also helps avoid any additional irritation caused by rubbing, whilst also instantly cooling it down. What‚Äôs more, you can use it both before and after you‚Äôve applied makeup, so even if you‚Äôre out and about in the sunshine you can give your face a quick spritz to help keep your skin feeling moisturised and cool. The spray can even be applied over the top of makeup ( Image: CureÃÅl) Shoppers have been going wild for the moisturising spray, with one saying: ‚ÄúA pleasant surprise! I received it to test not expecting a lot, but it has been a game changer since! A tiny spray leaves my face moisturised and feeling taken care of. Doesn‚Äôt leave any residue.‚Äù Another reviewer wrote: ‚ÄúReally hydrating spray, perfect under makeup! Loved it!! good size too for travel,‚Äù whilst a third added: ‚ÄúI liked that it was a spray, so that you can target only specific areas without being messy. Plus, it's not greasy and does not require reapplying.‚Äù Of course, all the hydration in the world isn‚Äôt enough to counteract a lack of sunscreen, and we‚Äôre loving the Garnier Ambre Solaire Sun Protection Over Makeup Mist, which is currently on sale on Amazon reduced from ¬£13 to ¬£6.96 here . The spray has been specially designed to be apple over the top of your makeup, which means you can keep on top of your SPF application throughout the day without having to worry about messing up your beauty look. Now go and enjoy the sunshine!",

Prime Minister Pedro SaÃÅnchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. \"This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,\" SaÃÅnchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying SaÃÅnchez's government was \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.\" While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries ‚Äî more than two-thirds of the United Nations ‚Äî recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, SaÃÅnchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was \"a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.\" The Socialist leader, who announced his country's decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel's response. SaÃÅnchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. \"We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,\" SaÃÅnchez added. \"Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,\" SaÃÅnchez said. \"From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.\" Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied.",

        "content": "A Tory frontbencher has admitted he has \"no idea\" what one of his ministerial colleagues is up to while holidaying in Greece . Yesterday The Mirror revealed that Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker had jetted off after being assured by the PM that it was ok to do so . Mr Baker maintained he is working hard on getting re-elected from Vasiliki. Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride said there are \"hundreds\" of Conservative candidates \"pounding the pavement\" up and down the country. But when Sky News host Kay Burley pointed out this doesn't include Mr Baker, he said: \"I can't comment on what Steve is doing or where he is or what he's up to. \"He may be designing his literature, doing all sorts of things, maybe making telephone calls, I have no idea. But what I can tell you is that we care fighting for absolutely every vote.\" Mr Stride said: \"What I know is that there are hundreds of Conservative candidates up and down the country pounding the pavements, knocking on doors, working for every single vote. This is an election that really matters.\" Steve Baker said he's been hard at work from Greece ( Image: PA) Wycombe MP Mr Baker has a slim majority of just 4,214. Labour claims his decision to go on holiday despite Rishi Sunak calling a snap election is a sign that he's given up on holding onto his seat. His Labour opponent, Emma Reynolds, told The Mirror: ‚ÄúI am staggered that Steve Baker has decided to go on holiday in the middle of the General Election campaign. He clearly doesn‚Äôt care about his constituents.\" But the Tory minister maintained this isn't the case. He told The Mirror: \"The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election. So I've chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.\" Asked whether voters would be angered by his decision to jet away, he said: \"My experience has been that when I talk to people who are quite keen to vote for me, they say: 'Good on you'. I've been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It's the only holiday we've got planned for the summer.\" He denied it was a sign of disgruntlement or that he'd thrown in the towel. Mr Baker stated: \"It's simply a sign when he (Mr Sunak) said to everybody when he was asked 'you can go on holiday', we booked a holiday.\" He admitted that \"one or two\" people have a problem with him going away and said it is \"unconventional\". It is unclear whether other Tories have gone away after being given the PM's blessing before the election announcement. Parliament had been set to be in recess this week, and most didn't expect the country to go to the polls until the autumn. Mr Baker said he didn't know whether others had carried on with holiday plans, despite the PM desperately touring the country touting for votes. He said: \"I suspect if they have, they haven't had the courage to say so. But I would rather be honest with the public.\" Watch the Mirror's new show Party Games as MPs spill Westminster secrets",

In her opening remarks, Prof. Fatou Sow SARR, ECOWAS Commissioner for Human Development and Social Affairs, emphasized the importance of this retreat in advancing regional stability, peace, and development in West Africa. She conveyed the Commission‚Äôs gratitude to technical and financial partners, including the Swedish and Danish governments, and the UNDP, for their support in addressing natural disasters, conflicts, and other challenges faced by member states. Mr. JoseÃÅ Gabriel Levy, Ph.D., Deputy Resident Representative of the UNDP in Nigeria, and H.E. Sune KROGSTRUP, Ambassador of Denmark to Nigeria and Permanent Representative of Denmark to ECOWAS, acknowledged the severe impact of climate change and insecurity on sub-Saharan African countries. They reaffirmed their commitment to partnering with ECOWAS and urged the international community to mobilize resources to combat these challenges, benefiting the entire African continent. During the workshop, experts will work to establish a shared understanding of the expected outcomes from the Regional Resilience Strategy for West Africa. They will identify areas for capacity strengthening, establish indicators to measure progress, and outline pathways and components of the strategy for institutional integration within the ECOWAS Commission. Approximately 40 participants, including representatives from ECOWAS and UNDP, experts, partners, and members of the working group, will attend the meeting. Discussions will focus on thematic areas such as good governance, peace, and security; macroeconomic resilience; sustainable livelihoods; social protection and resilience; gender sensitivity and social inclusion; and climate change and disaster risk reduction.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email As a parent, you want to give your child the best early learning center. While looking at the different choices, you realize how important it is to pick one that fits your child‚Äôs needs and your family‚Äôs values. Unfortunately, there are many things to think about that it can be a hard to make the right choice. When looking for an early learning center, this article will give you the five best things to think about. 1. Research and Visit Multiple Centres Before choosing an early learning centre, it‚Äôs essential to research and visit multiple options. This allows you to compare different programs, facilities, and environments to find the best fit for your child. Take the time to tour each centre, observe the classrooms, and ask questions about their educational philosophy and approach to childcare. Visiting multiple centres gives you a comprehensive understanding of your options and helps you make an informed decision. 2. Consider the Curriculum and Approach Each early learning centre may have a unique curriculum and approach to education. If you want your child to learn in a play-based, Montessori, or academic setting, you should think about that. Find centers that offer a complete curriculum that helps kids grow in all areas of their lives: socially, emotionally, cognitively, and physically. Take a look at how the center‚Äôs program includes things like music, art, outdoor play, and language development. 3. Evaluate Staff Qualifications and Experience The qualifications and experience of the staff are crucial factors to consider when choosing an early learning centre. Look for centres with qualified educators who have training in early childhood education and experience working with young children. Consider factors like staff-to-child ratios, turnover rates, and ongoing professional development opportunities. Qualified and experienced staff create a nurturing and supportive environment where children can thrive and learn. 4. Assess the Facilities and Resources Your child‚Äôs experience at the early learning center is affected by the facilities and resources that are there. Check to see if the classrooms, play areas, and outdoor areas are clean, safe, and easy to get to. Toys, books, art supplies, and educational materials that are right for your child‚Äôs age should be found in child care centers that encourage exploration and creativity. To make sure your child is comfortable and healthy, think about things like meal plans, nap times, and good hygiene habits. 5. Seek Recommendations and Reviews Seeking recommendations and reading reviews from other parents can provide valuable insights into the quality of an early learning centre. Pay attention to factors like communication, responsiveness, and overall satisfaction to help you make an informed decision. Recommendations and reviews offer first hand accounts and perspectives that can help you choose the right early learning centre for your child. Enroll Your Child in Early Learning Centre Today Enrolling your child in an early learning center is a significant decision that sets the foundation for their educational journey and development. So, enroll your child in childcare Cranbourne today and embark on a journey of discovery, exploration, and endless possibilities.

The strike, which Gaza medics said also left hundreds of civilians with shrapnel and burn wounds, drew condemnation from world leaders and was set to be discussed at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council from 1915 GMT. The sight of the charred carnage, blackened corpses and children being rushed to hospitals led UN chief Antonio Guterres to declare that \"there is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike a \"tragic accident\" but also vowed to push on with the military campaign to destroy Hamas over the October 7 attack and bring home all the hostages. More air strikes and shelling rained down overnight on besieged Gaza -- including Rafah's Tal Al-Sultan area where the displacement camp went up in flames near a facility of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. \"The situation is very dangerous,\" said one resident, Faten Jouda, 30. \"We didn't sleep all night. There was random bombing from all directions, including artillery shelling and air bombardment as well as firing from aircraft. \"We saw everyone fleeing again,\" she told AFP. \"We too will go now and head to Al-Mawasi because we fear for our lives,\" she said, referring to a nearby coastal area Israel has declared a safe \"humanitarian zone\". More than seven months into the bloodiest ever Gaza war, Israel has faced ever louder international opposition, as well as cases against the country and its leader before two international courts based in the Netherlands. In a landmark political move on Tuesday, Spain as well as Ireland and Norway were to formally recognise Palestinian statehood, a step so far taken by over 140 UN members but few Western governments. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on national television that \"recognition of the state of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice... it is also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace\". \"It is the only way to move towards the solution that we all recognise as the only possible way to achieve a peaceful future: that of a Palestinian state living side-by-side with the state of Israel in peace and security.\" Israel has slammed the announced move as a \"reward\" for the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement that rules Gaza, and earlier recalled its diplomatic envoys from Madrid, Dublin and Oslo. Foreign Minister Israel Katz went further on Tuesday and launched an attack on Sanchez on social media platform X, telling him that \"you are a partner to incitement to genocide of the Jewish people\". He also drew a parallel between Spanish minister Yolanda Diaz on the one hand and Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei and Hamas Gaza chief Yahya Sinwar on the other, following her call for a free Palestine \"from the river to the sea\". The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,050 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The Sunday night attack that killed dozens in the displaced persons camp was targeting two senior Hamas members, the Israeli military said. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound\" in the city and killed Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, senior officials for the militant group in the occupied West Bank. The strike came hours after Hamas had fired a barrage of rockets at the Tel Aviv area, most of which were intercepted. The resulting civilian toll in Gaza prompted a wave of condemnation, with Palestinians and many Arab countries calling it a \"massacre\". Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, said on Monday that \"the images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on Earth\". The EU's foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell said he was \"horrified\" and French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\". A US National Security Council spokesperson said Israel \"must take every precaution possible to protect civilians\". China voiced \"its grave concern over the ongoing Israeli military operations in Rafah\". Adding to the already heightened tensions, both the Israeli and Egyptian militaries on Monday reported a \"shooting incident\" that killed one Egyptian guard in the border area between Egypt and the southern Gaza Strip. Both forces said they were investigating.

        "content": "WETHERSPOONS is bringing back a \"legendary\" burger at all of its 809 locations - but you'll need to be quick to get your hands on it. The pub chain has revealed that its popular Brunch Burger is going to be back on the menu at all of its locations across UK and Ireland. 1 Wetherspoons is bringing back its Brunch Burger for Father's Day weekend But it will only be available for Father's Day day weekend - from Friday, June 14 and Sunday, June 16. This means you'll have to make sure to visit your local Spoons on the dates above if you want to give it a try. The burger returned last year after a ten-year hiatus and it was a fan favourite at the time with punters calling it \"legendary\". It's made up of a three ounce beef patty, American-style cheese, maple-cured bacon, free-range fried egg and is topped with a hash brown. The burger is available as part of a meal with chips and either a soft or alcoholic drink. The Sun has asked Wetherspoons how much the deal will be and we'll update this article as soon as we hear back. Last year, the burger cost ¬£7.15 with a soft drink and ¬£8.55 with an alcoholic drink. The burger with chips contains 1,234 calories.

Going 'out out'? Three tips to save BIG WHETHER you're celebrating a special occasion or you're just looking to blow off steam, going out can be pretty pricey nowadays. If you're planning a night out, consumer reporter Olivia Marshall explains how to cut costs. Location, location Have budgets in mind when choosing where to celebrate. For example, pricey London used to be the most popular destination for partying, but Liverpool has since overtaken the capital. The Merseyside city offers a more purse-friendly night out, according to party company Fizzbox. Drink to that Save cash with a few pre-club bevvies. Aldi is popular for its cheap and delicious prosecco. Bars like Revolutions have 2-4-1 cocktails if you book a table during Happy Hour, and signing up to O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs newsletter will get you a free drink. Try something new Many local venues host free or low-cost comedy nights. Check out comedy clubs, bars, or community centres in your area for events that won‚Äôt cost you a penny. It‚Äôs a great way to discover new comedians while enjoying a night out without breaking the bank. The chain is regularly updating and introducing offers to its food and drinks menu, as well as making other changes to its pubs. Earlier this month, Wetherspoons revealed it was introducing a host of new items including a ramen noodle bowl, Shawarma chicken wrap and three new breakfast items, including American-style pancakes. Plus, the boozer has revived its beloved Monday Club and will one again slash prices across its drinks menu at the start of every week. The pub giant's Monday Club had disappeared in recent years, but was once a favourite with its customers. In 2019 many expressed their dismay as the offer was axed in the run up to Christmas . With its relaunch Wetherspoons' fans will be able to pick up a pint of Ruddles or Worthington's for just ¬£1.49, with guest ales available from ¬£1.99. Pints of Shipyard and Strongbow will be ¬£2.25, Budweiser ¬£2.69 and Guinness ¬£2.99. A range of single spirit measures including Smirnoff raspberry and Gordon's pink gin will be ¬£1.99, with mixer included. Two cocktail pitchers will be available for ¬£13.25 and a range of soft drinks are just ¬£1.65. WAYS TO SAVE AT WETHERSPOONS Every year, Spoons holds its Tax Equality Day to highlight the benefits of a permanently reduced tax bill for the pub industry. It usually takes place in September, and last year it fell on Thursday, September 14. As well as its 12-day Real Ale Festival every Autumn, Wetherspoons also holds a Spring Festival. Wetherspoons is known for its meal deal offers that run all week long. These include Tuesday's Steak Club, Thursday's Curry Club and Fish Friday. For example, a standard curry club meal with an alcoholic drink is between ¬£8.55 and ¬£9.19. Outside of the deal, you would expect to pay around a fiver more for the same meal. You can enjoy bottomless brews all day in participating Wetherspoons pubs by buying one hot drink. The offer includes Tetley tea and a range of Lavazza coffee including a flat white, latte, cappuccino, and Americano. Prices start from just 99p but they can vary depending on your location.

        "content": "The Kofu District Court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a group of residents of Yamanashi Prefecture, demanding that Central Japan Railway halt construction of a section of a magnetic levitation train line that runs through the prefecture and pay them compensation for noise pollution, NHK reported. The court on Tuesday rejected the claims of the residents in the prefecture's Minami-Alps city whose homes and farmland are near a proposed viaduct construction site, it said. The NHK report did not say how many residents were involved in the suit. The court recognized that there is a ‚Äúhigh public interest‚Äù in the project, adding that there is no illegality in it that would warrant the construction to be suspended. The plaintiffs had sought an injunction against the construction and ¬•1 million ($6,400) per person, arguing that the value of their properties would decline, their living environment would deteriorate and they would suffer emotional distress during and after the viaduct's construction. JR Central welcomed the ruling, saying the court had made an appropriate decision, while the plaintiffs said it ignored how it would affect local residents, the report said.",

        "content": "Giovanni Pernice and Anton du Beke promo their 'Together' tour Anton Du Beke looked every inch the supportive pal as he and Giovanni Pernice announced they were back in the studio for tour rehearsals over bank holiday weekend. In a clip shared on the Strictly Theatre Co Instagram , Anton excitedly gushed about his \"favourite day\" with Giovanni before the pair shared a seemingly much-needed hug. In the clip, Anton announced: \"First day of rehearsals, always my favourite day - second day, less so,\" while Giovanni stood next to him smiling. \"Because we have to remember everything we've done in day one,\" the professional dancer chimed in. He excitedly added: \"We are back on tour, we are back!\" Giovanni then turned to Anton, as he continued: \"It feels nice. We are back on tour, we can't wait to see all of you.\" Strictly judge Anton went on to inform fans that the pair will be performing across venues nationwide from June 14 until the end of July. He continued: \"Very, very exciting, we've got a great show, we've got the most amazing cast, the dancers and singers are remarkable.\" \"Unbelievable,\" Giovanni agreed, adding: \"The show is called Together,\" which was followed by the pair sharing a hug.

Read our Privacy Policy Last week, a spokesman for law firm Carter Ruck told Express.co.uk that the BBC were \"gathering evidence\" after three of Giovanni's former dance partners put forward complaints. He said: ‚ÄúThere have been numerous serious complaints made to the BBC who are now in the process of evidence gathering. As it is still an ongoing matter no further comment can be made at this stage.\" Giovanni is said to be \"fully cooperating\" with the BBC 's process and has also hired a lawyer to fight his case. A spokesman for the dancer told The Sun: ‚ÄúSchillings is engaging with BBC Studios to provide it with Giovanni‚Äôs evidence to strongly rebut the claims being made about him and confirm that Giovanni is fully cooperating with that process. ‚ÄúAs with any reality TV show, when decisions are being made for entertainment reasons, the producers have a duty of care to all participants Trending Speculation about Giovanni's alleged behaviour came following Amanda Abbington's swift departure from Strictly last year. Just five weeks into dancing with Giovanni, she quit the show citing medical and personal reasons. Amanda, who is believed to be one of the complainants, later said she had mild Post traumatic stress disorder for several reasons following her experience on the show. Giovanni has reportedly quit the show after nine years in the wake of the claims, however this is yet to be confirmed by the BBC or the dancer himself. In a statement issued to his 1.1 million followers, Giovanni strongly denied any wrongdoing and told fans he looked forward to \"clearing\" his name. The BBC star continued: \"Those who have followed my journey on Strictly Come Dancing over the last decade will know that I am passionate and competitive. No-one is more ambitious for my dance partners than me. \"I have always striven to help them be the very best dancers they can be. This has always come from a place of love and wanting to win - for me and my dance partners.\" He signed off the post, adding: \"Thank you all once again for your continued love and support!\" Related articles Baby Reindeer star breaks silence on new role as she moves on from Martha drama Jeremy Clarkson's partner sparks calls for farm shake-up after new announcement Monty Don's Strictly U-turn as BBC co-star drops major hint that he's signed up Amanda Abbington's fianceÃÅ fires back at claim she 'ruined' Giovanni's career Nina Warhurst emotional over 'proud mum moment' as BBC fans call for return",

        "content": "The Gautam Adani run empire is looking at applying for a payments licence for UPI transactions that will enable it to compete with the likes of Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet‚Äôs Google Pay that together command a lion‚Äôs share of India‚Äôs digital market. If you think of Adani Group as primarily a B2B conglomerate ‚Äì think again. Adani‚Äôs consumer focus is getting sharper and its touchpoints with us ‚Äì the consumers ‚Äìgetting wider, and deeper. For one... there is Adani Wilmar ‚Äì an FMCG player; then there are airports and lounges run by Adani; Adani Power that powers up houses... and there‚Äôs the Adani-owned NDTV ... all operating at the cusp of direct to customer. Fresh reports suggest that Adani Group‚Äôs latest forays will challenge the big boys of digital payments as well as ecommerce. That‚Äôs right. India‚Äôs highly competitive digital payments space as well as the ever-growing ecommerce sector is likely to get one more player in Adani Group. The Gautam Adani run empire is looking at applying for a payments licence for UPI transactions that will enable it to compete with the likes of Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet‚Äôs Google Pay that together command a lion‚Äôs share of India‚Äôs digital market. This as per a Financial Times report. Adani Group is yet to confirm the newsbreak. The report also says that Adani Group will enter the ecommerce space by integrating ONDC or the Open Network for Digital Commerce into its Adani One app that it launched in December 2022, a month before the Hindenburg Research allegations surfaced. Adani Group will reportedly also launch a co-branded credit card that will reward users of all Adani services like electricity bills or airport shopping. So let‚Äôs take this one by one and see if Adani Group‚Äôs digital economy foray makes business sense. The UPI space in India is ballooning. We‚Äôre talking hundreds of billions here. India recorded about 131 billion UPI transactions last financial year. 131 billion transactions averages to every Indian popping out that smartphone and transacting over 150 times a year or practically every second day. And the total volume of UPI transactions last year was about ‚Çπ200 trillion ‚Äì or 200 lakh crore rupees! But UPI apps make very little money. Just a 1.1% commission only on transactions over ‚Çπ2,000. So in effect, all transactions under ‚Çπ2,000 make no money for the UPI service provider. So does it make sense for Adani Group to enter a business that doesn‚Äôt make tons of money? It sure doesn‚Äôt sound like Gautam Adani. A quick look at which UPI apps India uses. Walmart-backed PhonePe and Alphabet-backed Google Pay together command 86% of India‚Äôs UPI space. The rest is split between Paytm, BharatPe, Cred and other such. So, the question is ‚Äì even if Adani Group eyes the UPI space will it build from scratch of buy out a smaller potential rival? Remember, Paytm which was hit hard by RBI in Jan this year continues to operate as a third-party payment app. Now let‚Äôs move to the ecommerce play. Adani Group had launched Adani One in December 2022. It has so far been narrowly focused on travel services like booking flight tickets, train tickets, hotel rooms, and cabs to and from the airport. The Financial Times report says Adani Group will now integrate ONDC on Adani One and play the full ecommerce game. Remember Tata Group tried a super app Tata Neu and could not compete in the ecommerce market. Reliance Ajio on the other hand quickly gained ground. The question for Adani however is ‚Äì with a crowded space dominated by global players like Amazon as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart, plus domestic players like Reliance Ajio ‚Äì all in the backdrop of many not so successful upstarts including Snapdeal and Shopclues ‚Äì will Adani One, which, in the travel space already faces competition from MakeMyTrip, EaseMyTrip, Booking.com etc ‚Äì be able to make a dent in the full ecommerce play? Industry analysts say if Adani jumps into a new business, at least a big splash can be expected. But eventually if will boil down to how much and how long one stays invested in a new business idea. Gautam Adani sure has the pockets, but does he have the D2C appetite? We‚Äôll have to find out.",

        "content": "From Australia to China, private US companies to other non-governmental organisations and individuals, the search for MH370 became a global obsession New Delhi: One of the most enduring mysteries captivating mass consciousness for around a decade now has been the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370. While flying over the South China Sea, the aeroplane mysteriously disappeared from radar screens. Since then it has become a topic of fascination as a modern enigma which has been surrounded by numerous conspiracy theories, conjectures and attempts at discovery. It is again in the news after an expert has made a claim that he ‚Äòfound‚Äô the MH370 plane deep inside the Cambodian jungle using Google Maps. The news of another claim of finding the plane, while yet officially unsubstantiated, has again led the world to be caught by the MH370 fascination bug and the internet is ablaze. Story of the plane‚Äôs disappearance Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was an international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared from radar on 8 March 2014. It was flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia to Beijing Capital International Airport in China before its disappearance. The causes of its disappearance and where it went have still not been determined. The crew of the aeroplane last communicated with air traffic control around 38 minutes after takeoff. The craft was flying over the South China Sea at that time. The aircraft‚Äôs final transmission was an automated position report which indicated that the aircraft was flying at its assigned cruise altitude of flight level 350. It lost touch with the surveillance radar screens minutes later but was tracked by the Malaysian military‚Äôs primary radar system for another hour, deviating westward from its planned flight path. With all 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard presumed dead, the search for the missing aeroplane became the most expensive search in the history of aviation but the Malaysian Ministry of Transport‚Äôs final report from July 2018 was inconclusive. Mystery has world obsess over answer After the plane‚Äôs disappearance, multinational search efforts began in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. These were later extended to the Strait of Malacca and Andaman Sea. From Australia to China, private US companies to other non-governmental organisations and individuals, the search for MH370 became a global obsession. The aircraft‚Äôs crew did not relay any distress signal before its disappearance. Neither there were indications of bad weather nor any prior technical difficulties were reported, so theories have abounded over what happened to the flight. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been described as ‚Äúone of the biggest mysteries in modern aviation history‚Äù. Our fascination with it has been extreme and we have not been able to let go with finding an answer. Several documentaries have been produced on its disappearance, from the Smithsonian Channel to the Discovery Channel Broadcast and a three-part Netflix docuseries, MH370: The Plane That Disappeared, on the ninth anniversary of the flight‚Äôs disappearance. While many reasons can be given as to why our near-obsession with finding the truth about MH370 remains, some aspects of this remain inexplicable. Mysteries such as these have often catered to segments of society which feed off hidden truths and conspiracies theories. Many such incidents have existed and while the general public forgets about them, some are forever stuck finding answers. Currently, the case with MH370 though seems to be different. It has been able to hold the world‚Äôs attention for so long and this is not certain restricted to just isolated segments of conspiracy theorists. A major reason that can account for this is that after the plane‚Äôs disappearance, the search event became a global effort. A large number of countries came together and pitched in their efforts to find any clues about what happened to the plane. This large concentrated effort also makes it hard for everyone to let go of finding an answer. The internet age also contributed in making the plane‚Äôs disappearance a globally known phenomenon whose details were on the internet for everyone to know. This aided by internet fueled conspiracy theories have also made it hard for the story to be erased from the public consciousness. While the current news of the find using Google Maps has not been officially verified, it just goes on to show that the mystery will remain to haunt us and we as a global community are not letting go of it anytime soon.

        "description": "Wall Street's latest stock-split stock is an artificial intelligence (AI) company that helped kicked off the stock split craze three years ago.",
        "content": "Though Wall Street is firmly entrenched in a bull market right now, it's been nothing short of a wild ride for investors since this decade began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 , and Nasdaq Composite were whipsawed between bear and bull markets in successive years from 2020 through 2023. When uncertainty is a prevailing theme on Wall Street, it's not uncommon for investors of all walks to seek out the safety of industry-leading businesses that have handily outperformed the major stock indexes. For years, this had involved investors flocking to the \" FAANG stocks .\" But over the last three years, it's companies enacting stock splits that investors can't stop buying. Investors have gravitated to stocks conducting splits A \" stock split \" allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter both its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. I use the word \"cosmetic\" to make clear that stock splits have no effect on an underlying company's market cap or operating performance. Stock splits come in two varieties: forward and reverse. A forward-stock split is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for investors who might not be able to purchase fractional shares through their online broker. Meanwhile, a reverse-stock split aims to increase the share price of a publicly traded company to ensure its continued listing on a major stock exchange. While there have been a handful of stocks throughout the years that have gone on to be wildly successful following a reverse split, most investors are rightly chasing after companies conducting forward-stock splits. Businesses enacting forward splits are often out-innovating their competition and have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500. Since the midpoint of 2021, roughly a dozen high-profile companies have announced and/or completed a forward-stock split, including FAANG components Amazon and Alphabet . Through less than five months of 2024, four new juggernauts have joined this elite club. Wall Street's \"Class of 2024\" stock-split stocks Stock-split announcements kicked off in late January when retail kingpin Walmart ( WMT 0.83% ) unveiled plans to conduct a 3-for-1 forward split . Although Walmart's share price wasn't absurdly high at the time (around $165), the company's management team wanted to ensure that its associates would be able to purchase whole shares if they chose to participate in the Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Walmart began trading at its split-adjusted price on February 26, which is also the day S&P Dow Jones Indices made a few changes to the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average . Given Walmart's ability to use its size to its advantage in order to undercut its competition on price, this is unlikely to be the company's last stock split. Next up was fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill ( CMG 0.43% ) , whose share price was near $3,000 when, in March, it announced its intent to conduct a 50-for-1 forward split in late June . Like Walmart, Chipotle's management team wants to split its stock to make it more accessible to its team members. Shares of Chipotle have skyrocketed more than 14,200% since its January 2006 initial public offering price of $22. In addition to providing fresher foods that consumers have clearly shown they'll pay a premium for, Chipotle has benefited immensely by keeping its menu compact. A smaller menu helps its staff quickly prepare meals. After Chipotle came Sony Group ( SONY -0.63% ) . The Japan-based consumer electronics company announced a 5-for-1 stock split on May 14 , with an effective date for the company's American depositary receipts (ADRs) of October 8. This is Sony's first stock split in 24 years. Despite slower sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 gaming console, which debuted in late 2020, the company has enjoyed solid sales growth from its PlayStation Plus subscription service, which allows gamers to save their data in the cloud and play multiplayer games with their friends. Sales of the company's image sensors, which are used in next-generation smartphones, have been strong, too. Now, Wall Street has a fourth stock-split stock of 2024, and it's a familiar name: artificial intelligence (AI) kingpin Nvidia ( NVDA 2.57% ) . Say hello to Wall Street's newest stock-split stock Interestingly enough, Nvidia is one of the roughly \"dozen high-profile companies\" I alluded to earlier that have increased investors' fascination with stock-split stocks since the midpoint of 2021. Following the closing bell on May 22, Nvidia released its operating results for the fiscal first quarter (ended April 28) and announced a 10-for-1 forward split that'll become effective before trading begins on June 10. This marks the sixth split since Nvidia became a public company, and its first since July 2021, when it completed a 4-for-1 split. As has become the norm over the last 18 months, Nvidia mud-stomped Wall Street's consensus sales and profit expectations for the April-ended quarter. Net sales more than tripled to $26 billion from the prior-year period, with Data Center revenue surging 427% from what was reported in the comparable quarter in fiscal 2024. The catalyst for Nvidia is undeniably AI. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are what fuel the split-second decision-making needed in high-compute data centers handling generative AI solutions and training large language models. It's been estimated that Nvidia's chips account for around 90% of the GPUs deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. Nvidia has also been a prime beneficiary of demand absolutely swamping supply. Even with top chip fabrication company Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing meaningfully increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity -- high-bandwidth memory is packaged on CoWoS and is a veritable necessity for AI-accelerated data centers -- Nvidia is nowhere close to meeting AI-GPU demand. As a result, it's enjoyed otherworldly pricing power for its chips and increased its gross margin to north of 78%. Based solely on Nvidia's operating results over the last year and change, the company appears unstoppable. But looks can be deceiving. History is going to catch up with Nvidia sooner than later While it's difficult to find a flaw in Nvidia's fiscal first-quarter operating results, the company's guidance and history provide clues that suggest this stock-split stock could be knocked off of its pedestal sooner than later. One of the more glaring concerns for Nvidia is how next-big-thing innovation trends have fared over the last three decades. Beginning with the advent of the internet, every next-big-thing innovation has n avigated its way through an early innings bubble precipitated by lofty investor expectations. In simpler terms, investors have a terrible habit of overestimating how quickly a new technology, innovation, or trend will be adopted. History suggests it's highly unlikely for artificial intelligence to be the exception to this unwritten rule. While Nvidia's GPUs can still be wildly successful over the long run, the company's stock maintaining its nearly parabolic move higher probably isn't in the cards. Nvidia's fiscal second-quarter guidance also raised a red flag that likely flew over the heads of most investors. During the first quarter, Nvidia's gross margin (net sales less cost of revenue) tipped the scales at 78.4%. But for the second quarter, Nvidia is forecasting an adjusted gross margin of 75.5%, give or take 50 basis points. This forecast retracement in gross margin of close to three percentage points is likely the result of two factors. First, Nvidia is starting to contend with its first real bout of external competition. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are both rolling out their respective H100 GPU rivals. Even if Nvidia's chips are preferred in data centers, the mere presence of these external competitors will lessen AI-GPU scarcity and almost certainly weaken Nvidia's pricing power . The other probable issue is competition from within . Nvidia's top customers include Microsoft , Meta Platforms , Amazon, and Alphabet. Together, these four companies account for about 40% of its net sales. The problem is that all four are developing AI-GPUs of their own for their data centers. More than likely, this is the peak quarter for Nvidia's gross margin. While stock-split stocks are expected to remain all the rage on Wall Street, they're not all worth investing in.",

The Valencian government passed the LRAU planning legislation back in 1994, which critics later dubbed the \"land grab law\". The idea behind the new legislation was to speed up urban development . However the law was badly drafted, allowing abuses by unscrupulous developers. The modified planning laws allowed developers to ask that land be reclassified from rural to urban without the owners' permission.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) ‚Äî Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday picked up a second $1 billion promise of military aid in as many days for his war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defense system, which Zelenskyy sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. A day earlier, Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary‚Äôs objections to the bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia‚Äôs 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros ($7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia‚Äôs staunchest ally in the 27-nation bloc. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine‚Äôs defense efforts. Zelenskyy met with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the NATO alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built ‚Äúin a short time frame.‚Äù The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. ‚ÄúUkraine is also fighting Europe‚Äôs fight,‚Äù she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose swift distribution of centralized EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. ‚ÄúWe need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,‚Äù Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters ahead of the meeting. ‚ÄúThe urgency is very, very acute.‚Äù Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia‚Äôs response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine‚Äôs biggest military test since Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia‚Äôs bigger army and air force.",

        "content": "I am writing in regards to the idea of closing the roads in Lower Bidwell Park. It sounds like a great idea if you are on the younger and more-fit side. However, some parts of our population are being forgotten. There are people in our community, who are somewhat disabled but not so disabled as to need a wheelchair who would have trouble accessing the park without a car. (It was suggested in a letter to the E-R that people with disabilities could use their wheelchairs.) After having had asthma my whole life, I now get short of breath with physical exertion and can only take short walks but still want access to the park to go on those walks. Other older people have knee, hip, back problems, etc. but are not so disabled as to be in wheelchairs and who would also like to use the park. Families with small children drive through the park and picnic at tables along the creek. This would be much harder to do, if they have to carry everything in. I would suggest closing only one of the roads for people who walk and bike and let one remain open for people with families and disabilities. I also suggest the road on the south side should be closed, as there are more places to park along outside of it. I have lived here since 1976 and have been a regular user of the park and don‚Äôt want to lose my ability to do so. ‚Äî Laurel Heath, Chico",

        "description": "Chinese automaker Hozon Auto has started taking pre-orders for the Neta L‚Äôs pure electric variant in its home market. The new electric SUV‚Äôs pre-sale prices fall between 129,900 and 159,900 yuan (approx. ‚Ç¨16,800-‚Ç¨20,700), depending on the trim.",
        "content": "The Neta L is available in three purely electric variants. The official market launch is scheduled for the end of June, with deliveries starting in July. , the carmaker already presented four equipment variants of the Neta L EREV (Extended Range Electric Vehicle) with a price range of 129,900 to 159,900 yuan. At 4,770 mm long, 1,900 mm wide, and 1,660 mm tall, the Neta L electric is a mid-size SUV. It‚Äôs a five-seater model with a 2,810 mm wheelbase, and it offers 583 litres of luggage space, which can be increased to 1,434 litres by folding the second-row seat. Select configurations even include a frunk with an additional 67-litre storage space. Based on the indigenously developed ‚ÄòShanhai‚Äô platform, the Neta L is available as a range-extender EV and also a fully electric vehicle. The latter employs a single permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) in the rear across the range. This motor produces 170 kW (231 PS) and 310 Nm of torque, letting the EV hit 0 to 100 kph in 7.6 seconds and achieve a top speed of 180 kph. The Neta L EV features cell-to-body (CTB) technology, in which the battery cells are part of the vehicle body, enhancing stability and safety. CATL‚Äôs Shenxing LFP battery cells are standard in the electric SUV, and they give it 68 kWh of energy storage capacity, allowing it to cover a distance of 510 km on a full charge, as per CLTC. These battery cells support ultra-fast charging, so increasing the charging level from 10 to 80% capacity takes as little as 21 minutes. On the outside, the Neta L packs features like dynamic turn signals (front and rear), electrically deploying flush-fitted door handles, a panoramic sunroof with electrically operated sunshade, and 19-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 225/55 R19 Michelin e.Primacy tyres. Inside, a widescreen digital instrument cluster, two 15.6-inch touchscreens (centre and passenger-side) combined in a single frame, a 64-colour ambient lighting system, and a refrigerator built into the centre console are some of the highlights of the new electric SUV. The Neta L offers great comfort in the front with a 10-way power-adjustable massage seat for the driver and a 14-way zero-gravity power-adjustable massage seat for the passenger. Both front seats include memory, ventilation, and heating functions, a wing-type headrest, and lumbar support as well. The front passenger seat features even leg support adjustment. Rear-seat passengers can enjoy heating and two-position (117¬∞/122¬∞) recline functions. The Neta L EV will launch on the domestic market at the end of June. Mass deliveries of the electric SUV in China will start in July. ,",

        "content": "The Liberal Democrat Leader is set to outline his proposals to hold the water industry to account during a visit to the Lake District today. Under the party‚Äôs plans, local environment experts within the community would sit on the water company boards as non-executive directors to ‚Äúimprove public accountability and transparency‚Äù.

Sir Ed said: ‚ÄúWater companies are getting away with this national sewage scandal whilst Conservative MPs and ministers have just sat on their hands. ‚ÄúThese disgraced firms are destroying our treasured lakes and rivers with their filthy sewage dumping ‚Äì hitting human health, harming our precious environment and damaging the local tourism economy all at the same time. ‚ÄúEnough is enough. It‚Äôs time to get tough on the water industry and a key part of that change must be new ways to hold these firms to account, putting power in the hands of the local communities suffering from this scandal. ‚ÄúLocal environmental experts on company boards could hold water bosses‚Äô feet to the fire and local people would finally have a say in how their water company is run. ‚ÄúLiberal Democrats will have the boldest manifesto plans to end the sewage scandal ‚Äì from a tough new regulator to a ban on greedy exec bonuses to holding water bosses properly to account. ‚ÄúThis election will be about saving our country‚Äôs precious environment for the next generation, not least in special places like the Lake District.‚Äù Sir Ed is visiting the Lake District, where protests have taken place outside the office of water company United Utilities, after it was accused of pumping sewage into Unesco protected lakes. According to Liberal Democrat analysis of Companies House records, United Utilities has made ¬£2.3 billion in operating profits since 2019 and paid their top executives over ¬£2 million in bonuses.",

        "description": "Big names like Gavi and Cesar Azpilicueta are OUT of the Spain squad for this summers Euros",
        "content": "They may be a world away from their golden generation of the early 2010s, but make no mistake about it, still possess a competitive team heading into this summer's European Championships. With young stars such as and Pau Cubrasi being included in Luis de la Fuente's provisional squad, there is a clear emphasis on promoting the exciting youth that is coming through the ranks of La Roja. This means that some of the more experienced names have found themselves on the sidelines. That, combined with injuries to other young starlets has meant that there are a number of top talent from EspanÃÉa who will miss out on , many of whom would've been expected to be included at the start of the year. Gavi Midfielder Barcelona Lucas Vazquez Defender/Midfielder Real Madrid Pedro Porro Defender Tottenham Hotspur Miguel Gutierrez Defender Girona Robert Sanchez Goalkeeper Chelsea Kepa Arrizabalaga Goalkeeper Real Madrid Pau Torres Defender Aston Villa Marco Asensio Attacker Paris Saint-Germain Yeremy Pino Attacker Villarreal Cesar Azpilicueta Defender Atletico Madrid If not for suffering a cruciate ligament injury all the way back in November, there is no chance that would've been missing this tournament as he is . Since making his international debut aged just 17, the teenager sensation has already gone on to make 27 appearances for his country. It was always a race against time for Gavi to be fit in time for the Euros, and whilst there is a possibility that he would've healed from his injury in time to participate, throwing him in at the deep end after such a long lay-off would be beyond dangerous. For someone who has plenty of time to impact his country, short-term pain is better for long-term gain. is often someone who is used to being on the periphery of both his national team and his club side. Yet, his versatility makes him a useful option to have in your squad, particularly in tournament football. Sadly, the 32-year-old won't be joining teammates Nacho and Dani Carvajal on their trip to Germany this summer. With nine-caps to his name, the winger-turned-full-back seemingly responded to his omission from the squad with a Perhaps Vazquez is right to feel frustrated about missing out on his third straight tournament. Another right-back who might be shocked to find himself out of the reckoning is Tottenham's . Though he has only managed to gain three caps for his country, the 24-year-old has impressed under Ange Postecoglu and has Only James Maddison, Heung-Min Son and Brennan Johnson provided more Premier League assists for Tottenham during the 23/24 season than Pedro Porro. This was not enough, however, for the former Sporting Lisbon man to break into the team. With many years left, finding his way back into tournament football is not out of the realm of possibility for Porro. On this occasion though, the Spaniard will have to watch from home and begin preparations for the next campaign. Moving over to the left side of defence now, and a young man who has come to prominence with some star-making displays over the last 12 months. Having come through the Real Madrid academy, Miguel Gutierrez found himself being shipped off to Girona with very little fanfare in 2022. What wasn't predicted was the incredible run the small Catalan side would go on as they finished third in the 23/24 La Liga table. Gutierrez was a massive part of this, with the 22-year-old showcasing all the abilities a modern full-back requires. This was not enough for him to receive a first call-up, but keep an eye out for this name in the future. Thibaut Courtois' injury presented with the most opportune chance to reignite his career at one of the biggest clubs in the world. It had been a topsy-turvy spell for the 'keeper after arriving at Chelsea for a world record fee. Back in his home country, perhaps the 29-year-old would find his feet once more. In reality, Kepa found himself being demoted to effective third-choice, with Ukranian Andriy Lunin being preferred by Carlo Ancelotti. This would've done Arrizabalga's confidence no good, nor his chances at being called him to represent his country this summer. Another Chelsea goalkeeper who has struggled to fit the billing. There must be something in the water in West London. 's move to join Mauricio Pochettino was a strange one on the surface. The shot-stopper had already been replaced at Brighton by Jason Steele by the time his transfer came to be. Having already been capped by his country, perhaps the 26-year-old could find the form that heralded praise not long before. Instead, history repeated itself. After a few months, Sanchez found himself warming the bench with Djordje Petrovic being preferred. That all but ended the Spaniard's hopes of being one of the three goalkeepers in this summer's squad. From 2019-2022, was a regular feature in the Spanish national team. Often linked with a move to Manchester United, it was Aston Villa who ended up managing to secure his services from Villarreal last summer. It took a moment for the 27-year-old to find his feet, but he put in a respectable performance over the course of the season, ranking highly in key areas such as blocks and clearances for the club. This was not enough to earn him a recall though, with Aymeric Laporte being one notable name to be included instead despite his exploits in Saudi Arabia. It's somewhat remarkable to think that is now in the prime years of his career having previously been . Sadly, he's gone from scoring in the Champions League final as a youngster for Real Madrid, to being let go as a free agent and struggling to make his mark at Paris Saint-Germain. The 28-year-old featured in just 36% of the possible minutes available to him in his debut Ligue 1 season. This, combined with the likes of Lamine Yamal bursting onto the scene, has meant that Asensio may forever find himself on the outside looking in for the rest of his international career. What was written about Gavi is just as applicable when it comes to the tale of Yeremy Pino. At just 21 years old, it is clear that Pino has the potential to be a star for La Roja in years to come. With 12 caps to his name already, he likely would've been adding to that this summer if it wasn't for tragic circumstances. Just like Gavi, the Villarreal superstar suffered a cruciate ligament injury, ironically at a very similar time to the Barcelona wonderkid. Recovery has been arduous and whilst a full one might be made in time for the tournament, building up match fitness is a whole other ball game. That sees Pino miss out for now. For all the exciting young talent that will be available for De La Fuente this summer, there is something to be said for leadership and experience. These two qualities are something that has in abundance. There is not much that the Chelsea legend hasn't done in his storied career. He is a Champions League, Europa League and Premier League winner and knows exactly the sort of pressure that comes with competing in major tournaments. He may not be a spring chicken at 34 years old, but his knowledge and professionalism could've been welcome in helping some of the next crop of talent settle in what will be a testing environment.",

        "content": "Abu Dhabi-based education technology leader Alef Education announced the price range for its initial public offering (IPO) on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) today. The company also revealed the commencement of the subscription period for potential investors. Alef Education set its offering price range between AED 1. 30 and AED 1. 35 per share. This translates to an expected market capitalization of between AED 9. 10 billion (US$2. 48 billion) and AED 9. 45 billion (US$2. 57 billion) at the time of listing. The company will offer 1. 4 billion ordinary shares, representing 20% of its issued share capital. The total offering size is expected to range between AED 1. 82 billion (US$496 million) and AED 1. 89 billion (US$515 million). The proceeds from the IPO will not go to Alef Education itself, but rather to its existing shareholders, Tech Nova Investment and Kryptonite Investments. Alef Education, a provider of AI-powered learning solutions, boasts a strong track record in the UAE. The company serves all public schools in the Emirates and has a presence in a select number of international markets. It also has a long-term contract with the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK), guaranteeing fee collection for the next seven years. The subscription period for the IPO opened today, May 28th, 2024, and will close on June 4th for individual investors. Institutional investors will have an extra day, with their subscription period ending on June 5th. The final offer price is expected to be determined after the book-building process concludes. Following the IPO, Alef Education has pledged to distribute a minimum dividend of AED 135 million for each of its financial years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 to all shareholders excluding the selling shareholders. This translates to a projected dividend yield of approximately 7. 42% at the top of the price range and 7. 14% at the lower end. If Alef Education successfully completes its IPO, it will be the first education technology company to list on a UAE exchange. The offering is seen as a significant development for the UAE's growing technology sector and education reform efforts.",

        "content": "Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil has praised Super Eagles striker Sadiq Umar for his commitment to the team since he returned from injury, Soccernet.ng reports. Umar joined Real Sociedad two years ago for a club-record ‚Ç¨20 million. The Super Eagles striker had earlier impressed at Almeria, where he produced 43 goals and 19 assists in 84 games. It looked like the deal would be a great one for both sides after Umar scored on his debut for the club against Atletico Madrid. However, those hopes faded away two games later, when he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury. That injury kept him out of action for the rest of the season, ensuring that he missed 51 games for club and country. However, Umar returned to action in the just-concluded season, but his game time was limited. Coach Imanol gave him a few chances, and he did show glimpses, scoring two belters in the Laliga. In all, the 27-year-old striker registered three goals and one assist in 26 appearances for Real Sociedad. Because of his limited game time, Umar‚Äôs future has been in the balance, with reports suggesting that he may be keen on an exit. Als o, he seemed to have fallen out with Imanol before the end of the season because he only got 22 minutes of action in the last nine games of the season. However, after the final game of the season, in an interview, Imanol insisted that he has a decent relationship with Umar and he has been impressed with his commitment. ‚ÄúThe only thing I can thank him (Sadiq) for is his commitment, for how he has behaved since he arrived, whether he has been more or less fortunate,‚Äù Imanol said per Futbol Fantasy. ‚ÄúThere has not been any bad gesture, he has always wanted to contribute and, when he has not done it, it has been a technical-tactical decision. He has respected it, he has continued training until the end, being one more. That‚Äôs why I say, I can‚Äôt ask for more from these types of players. ‚ÄúHe gives his all, this is football and it‚Äôs about performing, getting it right. But hey, the main thing and the basic thing, for me, is to give it your all, give it your all and be respectful. In Sadiq‚Äôs case, I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt say anything bad about him.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is clear that players who have had this injury, well, suffer a lot when it comes to returning and getting back into the rhythm.‚Äù Getafe has been touted as a possibility destination for Umar. He would have to make a big decision this summer if he wants to save his career.",

Jim Newsam came in behind on Carole Hawthorne‚Äôs Tullybee Louie who, like the winner, just added cross country time penalties to their first phase score. The 110 Open class of five was won by Steven Smith with Virginia Maguire‚Äôs homebred Thoroughbred gelding, Handsome Starr, who had a 15-point advantage over second placed Alex Houston on her 14-year-old mare, Minty Imp. Advertisement Advertisement The Gilford based Smith Brothers Eventing, claimed another top placing in the EI 110 class where Senior rider, Casey Webb, rose to the fore with Ballygreenan Break Point, having climbed four places from dressage following the retirement cross country of the early leader, Alex Houston, riding My Atlantic Encore and the fall of Clare Abbott with Kilcoltrim Cooley at the first part of fence seven. Ballygreenan Break Point is an eight-year-old mare by the American Thoroughbred Stallion, Pointilliste, and is owned and bred by Valerie Breen. The mare finished over eight points clear of stable mate, Greenhall Gold Dust, Gail McNabb‚Äôs six-year-old gelding by Dignified Van‚Äôt Zorgvliet which was ridden by Steven Smith. Kitty Cullen had the only completion score in the EI110J class with her father‚Äôs striking buckskin coloured Trakehner gelding, Grand Marnier. Kim Constable, sponsor of the weekly Volunteer Cash Prizes, picked her first red rosette at this level in the EI 110 Amateur class with Urneypark Big Cat. Advertisement Advertisement She moved up one place after the first phase when the early leader, Katie McKee, picked up an unfortunate 20 penalties cross country. Second place was taken by Britt Megahey on R Showman who was still jubilant after his win two weeks ago at Lisgarvan. Ciarrai Rice, no stranger to success, added another win to her impressive record on Lady J, her eight-year-old mare by the Irish Sport Horse, Hallo Picasso. They led from start to finish with an impressive dressage score of 23.8 to have almost a 12-point advantage over a delighted second placed, Ros Morgan and VOS Surprise who have been thoroughly enjoying the Northern Region events since their relocation from England last year. The second win of the day for the Constable family went to 14-year-old Maya who was double handed in the EI 100 P class. Advertisement Advertisement She took the win with Rockon Pedro, her mother‚Äôs 14-year-old grey gelding by the Connemara stallion, Newtown Pedro, replicating their performance at Tyrella 4. Emma Stewart slotted into second place with the Connemara Pony, Loughnageer Prince with whom she has been competing since Tyrella last year. There are a number of mothers and daughters who are currently competing in the Northern Region. One of those is the Herron duo of Johanna and her daughter Rosey. Rosey won the EI 100 J class on Solitaire Rusty Brown, a combination that won the Patsy Boal Memorial Trophy at the Annual Awards Ball last year. They finished marginally ahead of Molly O‚ÄôConnor riding Sarah Hughes‚Äôs Dutch bred gelding, Alcatraz who are now Millstreet bound this week. Twenty-year-old Crossgar rider, Sam Forbes, certainly had a day to remember by claiming two victories. He had a runaway victory in the EI 100 with RC Charlie, his mother‚Äôs 11-year-old gelding, with whom he secured Martina McKinley‚Äôs top mark of 23.8 which was his completion score. Our Pollyanna took second place, ridden by Casey Webb, also finishing on their dressage score. This eight-year-old mare, by Yeats, is owned and bred by David Mitchell. Advertisement Advertisement Lucinda Webb-Graham reserved her top marks in the EI 90 Amateur class for Katie McKee riding Elusive Clover, owned by Wendy Anderson, and sired by Elusive Emir. This six-year-old mare has shown consistent good form since Katie took over the ride earlier this year following Wendy‚Äôs temporary relocation to Scotland. Johanna Herron took second place just marginally behind having kept both jumping phases clear and just adding time faults across the country. Sam Forbes was back, centre stage, in the EI 90 class of 17. He moved up from second place when Elaine O‚ÄôConnor who was leading, decided to retire with Kilcolman Curlew, following a few issues cross country. Sam added nothing to his first phase score with DCS Millhouse Platinum, followed 5.5 points adrift by Holly Wray and R Diva, Helen Anderson‚Äôs Tolan R gelding who occupied the same position at Tyrella 4. Advertisement Advertisement There was also great jubilation in the MacNabb household in Downpatrick following 14-year-old Ellen‚Äôs victory in the EI 90P class with Bonecastle Lass, with whom she has never been out of the top five in their last five outings. They stole a march, fractionally, over Zara Reid with the very accomplished Greylands Diamond. Girl, who have developed a very impressive string of results since the beginning of the March 2023 season. Without a doubt, the most excited family at Hazeldene were the Watsons from Dromore who had incredible success in very good company in a class of 20. Charlie, who will be 12 in August, meant business from the outset with her Connemara Pony, Leamore Girl, owned by her grandfather, Mervyn Gibson. She stormed to victory, finishing on her flatwork mark, almost eight points clear of Katie McKee and Darkies Boy, Ros Murphy‚Äôs 12-year-old gelding by Rocklands Prince who also added nothing to their dressage score. Advertisement Advertisement Charlie‚Äôs brother, 13-year-old Zach took third place with Toberpatrick Gentle Dove on his very first outing under Eventing Ireland rules. It was immensely pleasing for the organisers to see so many riders out competing for the first time and, very evidently, enjoying the experience. Northern Region is extremely grateful to Andrew and Laura Napier for rearranging their existing calendar to enable this event to run. Organisers are also extremely grateful to all the volunteers, many of whom also changed their plans to ensure availability. Its that dedication on everyone‚Äôs part that makes the region very special. Northern Region is so glad that Kim Constable‚Äôs sponsorship of the volunteer prizes means very justifiable recognition of the very valuable role they play in the sport. This week‚Äôs winners were: ¬£200 ‚Äì Shirley Chambers ¬£50 ‚Äì Ann Cully Wine- Joanna Cowan Beauty Products- Lisa Tumilty Advertisement Advertisement A Northern Region spokesperson commented: ‚ÄúWe wish all our members who are competing at Millstreet International, the very best of good luck. ‚ÄúWe must also take a moment to think of Jesse Campbell and the extended family and friends as well as the whole eventing community, on the very sad and untimely death of Georgie while competing at Bicton. Our thoughts and prayers are with them all at this very sad time.‚Äù Full results EI 115 Open: Casey Webb, HHF Elegance.

        "content": "Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has nothing but empathy for Hardik Pandya as he navigates a challenging phase in his career and is hopeful that the all-rounder, who ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt been a free man in the last two months‚Äù, will become one during next month‚Äôs T20 World Cup. Pandya endured a forgettable IPL both as captain and player with his team Mumbai Indians ending bottom of the heap in the points table. What made things worse was the incessant jeering of fans whenever he took the field, including at MI‚Äôs home turf ‚Äî the Wankhede Stadium. But Harbhajan expects the tide to turn in the Americas during the T20 showpiece. ‚ÄúWhen he wears that blue jersey, he will be a different Hardik Pandya because we know he can score those runs and take those wickets. I want Hardik to come good as he has gone through a lot and I wish him all the very best to have a very good tournament for India,‚Äù Harbhajan told PTI in an exclusive interview. ‚ÄúIf he has a good tournament, obviously India will have a great chance to go forward,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYes, his form is a bit of a concern...and lot of other stuff was going on around him, his shifting from Gujarat to Mumbai, was a big change and the team (MI) didn‚Äôt react too well to Hardik coming back and that too as captain,‚Äù the 43-year-old added. The reason for the fan backlash against Pandya was MI‚Äôs decision to hand him the captaincy after taking it away from the long-serving Rohit Sharma. There was speculation throughout the season that MI‚Äôs dressing room was a divided house due to the change of guard. Rohit will now captain the national side with Pandya as his deputy in the World Cup starting June 1. Harbhajan, a multi format World Cup-winner, urged the team management to bring Pandya and Rohit on ‚Äúsame page‚Äù. ‚Äú...it looked like they (MI) were not playing together as a team. So there was a lot going on. Hardik wasn‚Äôt a free man in the last two months. I believe both of them and many others who have played in different teams will have to come together to do something special for the nation...,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWinning a World Cup is a bigger achievement than winning an IPL trophy, so I would urge the management to bring everyone together, have them on one page and make sure they play like one. ‚ÄúI believe it‚Äôs the responsibility of the management to come together, and win together. Even if they lose they should be losing together.‚Äù",

Pandian said that, the people of Odisha do not want to drag Lord Jagannath and the temple into politics. Leaders and Union Ministers coming from outside Odisha are insulting the Chief Minister and showing disrespect. This is what the people of Odisha do not like. The BJP has announced its intention to stop the Mission Shakti. If BJP comes to power, they will stop the mission. BJP has asked to stop Mission Shakti during elections the BJD strategist Karthik Pandian further said this. Similarly, BJP has announced its intention to close BSKY and implement Ayushman Bharat Yojana. Ayushman Bharat is only for BPL families. But BSKY scheme is for everyone. 90 percent people of the state shall get benefits from this scheme if BJD is elected for the sixth term. He said that everyone will be included in the BSKY Naveen card. Giving importance to the youth sector, Naveen government has arranged 5T schools, 5T colleges and youth budget. Nua-O and student scholarship schemes have been launched for 98 percent of children. The BJP is planning to stop it when there is nothing in BJP election manifesto for the youth. The Chief Minister has formed SDC for the identification of tribals. SDCs have not been formed even though there are more tribals in the state where the dual engine is running. BJP will stop it if it comes to government. There will be no peace in a state with a double engine government. There is peace in Odisha now due to BJD. But the BJP has included many people involved in criminal activities. Pandian said in the press conference that the BJP is shocked after the BJD election manifesto talked about providing free electricity to people.",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Belgium have recalled Axel Witsel to the squad for Euro 2024 in Germany next month but there is no place for Thibaut Courtois despite the Real Madrid goalkeeper being in line to feature in Saturday's Champions League final. Coach Domenico Tedesco announced his 25-man squad for next month's tournament on Tuesday with Witsel's recall a major surprise. Tedesco had visited the 35-year-old Atletico Madrid defender to persuade him to come back to the team. Witsel won the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar in late 2022, when Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Courtois walked out on the Belgian squad last June when he was not named captain in the wake of Eden Hazard‚Äôs retirement, leading to a public falling out with Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was criticised by teammates and has since expressed regret but the rift between him and the coach appears not to have healed. Soon after the walkout, Courtois suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for most of the season, returning for Real Madrid only earlier this month and being in the squad for Saturday‚Äôs final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. \"Courtois was very clear and honest and early in his communication. The latest information we received is that he is not ready for the European Championships. He knows his body best,\" said Tedesco at a press conference on Tuesday. \"I have had Axel in my mind for a long time, even during the qualification. It's about quality, Witsel offers a lot of quality. \"He is a key player at AtleÃÅtico Madrid. I met him, wanted to see him, look into his eyes. We need him, he has experience and can help the young players. Experience in that position is important. We are playing a European Championship, that is no small thing,\" the coach added. Club Brugge fullback Maxim De Cuyper is the only uncapped player in the squad. \"I have been following Maxim De Cuyper for a long time but never had the chance to select him before, but he now deserves to be in the squad,\" said Tedesco, who picked 25 players instead of the 26 that UEFA are allowing for each squad. Belgium's most capped international Jan Vertonghen competes at the age of 37 and with 154 caps. The squad also includes top scorer Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 83 times in 114 appearances for his country. Squad: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal).

        "description": "‚ÄòClearly the umpiring philosophy must come from AFL head office.‚Äô",
        "content": "COMMENT Halfway through another AFL season and as always, the relentless evolution of the game throws up a few changing themes and trends. Clubs and players will attempt to get ahead of the curve. Some will succeed, most will fail. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Sydney with only one loss and a percentage of 150 are leading the competition and are clear trendsetters. On-field synergy is so important and the Swans have achieved this in spades. They have had 16 players who have played every game and have used just 27 players in total and only one debutant. Every club would envy this stability of on-field personnel. Then there is the developing trend of a ruckman becoming an extra big-bodied midfielder after the hit-out part of the ruck role has been completed. Brody Grundy is performing this role beautifully. Sydney‚Äôs midfield balance is suited to the modern game. With Grundy‚Äôs ground-level work, the grunt of James Rowbottom, Taylor Adams and the shutdown role of James Jordon, the foundation is being successfully built for the Swans classy and creative stars. AFL football is currently very congested around the stoppages but that means if the ball can be taken out of the congestion there is lots of space for the runners to work their magic. Again the Swans are leading the pack by using the open field to slice through their opponent‚Äôs zone defences. A core group led by Isaac Heeney, Chad Warner, Errol Gulden, Nick Blakey and Tom Papley have the speed and precision kicking skills other teams are unable to match. The evolution of umpiring particularly around the interpretation of the always contentious holding-the-ball seems to have taken another turn. Recently the balance between the rights of the ball carrier and the rights of the tackler have to a degree been rectified. Over recent seasons high contact and in the back free kicks have been rarely paid. To my eye this year at least the player with the ball has been given much more latitude and fewer holding the balls are being awarded. I‚Äôm quite happy with that umpiring evolution, although many disagree including the majority of the coaches. Damien Hardwick raised an interesting statistic from the Suns‚Äô loss to Carlton - there was 131 tackles but only 27 free kicks including only four for holding the ball. Dimma, clearly like many in the football fraternity, wants more tackles to result in a holding the ball free kick. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if the same urgency was given to better protecting the player in possession both when he is on his feet, or at the bottom of a pack with multiple opponents lying on his back. Much of this angst comes from the minimalistic trend in umpiring of paying vastly fewer free kicks than in previous generations. This is a trend that does not make sense. By way of comparison, in the last two games of the 1990 finals series there was an average of 79 tackles with 47 free kicks paid by the two umpires. So tackling numbers have doubled and free kicks have halved. With so few kicks being paid when an umpire awards a technical free kick, such as what happened late in the Fremantle-Collingwood game when Magpie Lachlan Sullivan gave the ball to teammate Nick Daicos and not the umpire for a ball-up and got pinged for time wasting, all hell breaks loose. Attempting to explain the rules of the game to a newcomer is quite confusing. When they then watch the game it appears there are no rules. The basic rules of our game are pretty simple, if the player hasn‚Äôt got the ball, you can‚Äôt tackle them and clearly that gets paid because they‚Äôre easy to see. You can‚Äôt make contact above the shoulder and that‚Äôs happening all the time, but not resulting in free kicks. And you can‚Äôt push a player in the back, and you can‚Äôt lie on his back but that‚Äôs happening all the time and isn‚Äôt being paid. Plus, this year, even holding the ball is rarely paid. It‚Äôs not the individual umpires. Clearly the umpiring philosophy must come from AFL head office. Before it was disbanded a few years ago the Rules Review Committee played a role in this process. A few times each season this group made up of umpires, umpiring management, AFL football manager and a handful of ex-players would meet to discuss the evolution of the game, particularly in regards to the rules and interpretations that influence umpires‚Äô decision making. Maybe resurrecting that committee would be a worthwhile initiative. What has also taken place in the season to date is the rare occurrence of a first-year teenager absolutely exploding on to the AFL scene. He might be only 19 and only played half a season, but Eagles prodigy Harley Reid has laid claim to being the most watchable player in the game. He‚Äôs such a phenomenon because he displays that enormous combination of strength, power, speed and skill. That he is so young and inexperienced is simply amazing. He oozes a confidence that makes him look like the big kid dominating in the schoolyard. Elite rookies often have a stack of confidence built on excelling in their junior days but opposition sides and the pressure of the intense competition usually gets the better of them eventually. So that‚Äôs the next phase that will come for Reid, who is so powerful at ground level. The fend-off has quickly become his trademark and he‚Äôs one of the few midfielders that can take a big pack mark. But what you do in your first half season is not what you‚Äôre going to do your whole career. There‚Äôs a lot of challenges to come and that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not going to break the glass in all of them. I am not scheduled to be at any Eagles game this year and I wish I was because, like everyone else, I‚Äôd like to see Reid live. What he‚Äôs doing as a first-year teenager is remarkable. I have joined the Harley fan club. And the world‚Äôs his oyster. With next TV rights deal imminent the player salary cap will soon be around $20 million. During this decade there will be 50-odd players earning more than a $1m and the very elite probably earning more than $1.5m. In March, after the round one Giants-Collingwood match, I pondered whether Tom Green or Nick Daicos could be the first $2m-a-year players later in this decade. Reid should be added to that list.",

        "content": "Bedroom Drought: Not Having Lula Lula Causes Private Parts to Shrink and Become Elastic, Experts Warn Experts have warned that Gen Zers are not having lula lula as much as they should and this could hurt their body parts. According to experts, Gen Zers of legal age are having relations less than any other generation in history and this could lead to their private parts shrinking. Also read: Shurugwi Woman Pours Hot Cooking Oil On Her Husband For Starving Her Of Lula Lula Decline Lula Lula Among Gen Zers According to a recent survey by California University in 2021, 38% of people aged 18-30 reported not having relations in a year. Experts caution that abstaining from lula lula for extended periods can have detrimental effects on their genitalia. Dr Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, a sex and relationship expert, explained that most people need affection, touch, and sexual connections with others. Without these, mental health can deteriorate, leading to increased anxiety, sadness, and stress. Also read: A Deadly Concoction: Man Dies After Consuming Lula Lula Enhancing Concoction, Traditional Healer Arrested How Not Having Lula Lula Causes Private Parts to Shrink For men, prolonged lack of lula lula may result in a rare condition called penile atrophy. Dr Suwinyattichaiporn explains this occurs when the penile tissue becomes less elastic, causing a man‚Äôs joystick to shrink by 1-2 centimetres. Her warning was echoed by Tobias Kohler, an assistant professor of urology at Southern Illinois University, who states that without regular erections, a man‚Äôs joystick will lose elasticity and become smaller. In more severe cases, both men and women may experience vaginal/penile atrophy and pain during lula lula after going at least five years without intercourse. Additionally, lack of ejaculation may increase the risk of prostate cancer, as regular ejaculation helps flush out harmful chemicals that build up in semen.

For women, lack of sexual activity can cause vaginal atrophy, leading to discomfort and pain during intercourse. Regular sexual activity increases blood flow, lubrication, and elasticity of vaginal tissues, preventing these issues. Experts continue to study the exact timeline for the development of penile and vaginal atrophy. Still, the consensus is clear: regular intercourse is important for both mental and physical health.

        "content": "Trump tells donors that the student demonstrators are part of a ‚Äòradical revolution‚Äô and promises to defeat them. Former United States President Donald Trump has promised that he will crack down on pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses if he wins the 2024 US presidential election. Earlier this month, the likely Republican nominee told a small group of predominantly Jewish donors that he would expel student demonstrators, who he claimed were part of a ‚Äúradical revolution‚Äù, from the US if he is elected, according to a report by The Washington Post released on Monday. Keep reading ‚ÄúIf you get me elected, and you should really be doing this ... we‚Äôre going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,‚Äù Trump said, according to the report, quoting people at the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The former president also praised the New York police for clearing the campus at Columbia University in late April, and said the other cities needed to follow suit, saying ‚Äúit has to be stopped now‚Äù. Student protests against the Israeli war on Gaza have rocked the US over the past few weeks, prompting a police crackdown on many campuses and more than 2,000 arrests. In mid-April, Columbia University saw a Gaza solidarity encampment, with students urging the institution to divest from companies associated with Israel. This movement spread to campuses in California, Texas, and many other states. University administrators accused pro-Palestinian demonstrators of using anti-Semitic language and creating an unsafe environment on campus. But students rejected those claims, which they said aimed to distract people from what is happening in the Gaza Strip. The majority of Americans below 30 years of age want a ceasefire in Gaza, according to a poll. During the donors‚Äô meeting in New York on May 14, Trump expressed his support for Israel‚Äôs right to continue ‚Äúits war on terror‚Äù and highlighted his policies towards Israel if he is elected. He has previously said Israel was ‚Äúlosing the PR war‚Äù with its actions in Gaza. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre losing the PR war. They‚Äôre losing it big. But they‚Äôve got to finish what they started,‚Äù Trump said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. According to the report, Trump did not mention Netanyahu, who provoked the Republican‚Äôs ire when he acknowledged President Joe Biden was rightfully elected in 2020. Israeli attacks on Gaza since the start of the war have killed more than 36,000 people, with 81,026 others wounded and thousands more missing, presumed dead under the rubble. Israel launched its assault on the besieged territory after a Hamas-led attack in southern Israel killed about 1,140 people.",

        "content": "Iran‚Äôs parliament re-elected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country‚Äôs president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran‚Äôs capital city, in which he built onto Tehran‚Äôs subway and supported the construction of modern high-rises. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support, as a Revolutionary Guard general, for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country‚Äôs police chief. In Tuesday‚Äôs vote, challenger Mojtaba Zonnouri, a hard-line Shiite cleric who once led the parliament‚Äôs national security commission, won 60 votes. A former foreign minister to hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Manouchehr Mottaki, received five votes. Qalibaf offered no immediate remarks after the vote. The March parliament election saw the country‚Äôs lowest turnout since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Of those elected to the 290-seat body, hard-liners hold over 230 seats, according to an Associated Press survey. A trained pilot, Qalibaf served in the paramilitary Guard during the country‚Äôs bloody 1980s war with Iraq. After the conflict, he served as the head of the Guard‚Äôs construction arm, Khatam al-Anbia, for several years leading efforts to rebuild. Qalibaf then served as the head of the Guard‚Äôs air force, when in 1999 he co-signed a letter to reformist President Mohammad Khatami amid student protests in Tehran over the government closing a reformist newspaper and a subsequent security force crackdown. The letter warned Khatami the Guard would take action unilaterally unless he agreed to put down the demonstrations. Violence around the protests saw several killed, hundreds wounded and thousands arrested. Qalibaf then served as the head of Iran‚Äôs police, modernizing the force and implementing the country‚Äôs 110 emergency phone number. However, a leaked recording of a later meeting between Qalibaf and members of the Guard‚Äôs volunteer Basij force, included him claiming that he ordered gunfire be used against demonstrators in 2003, as well as praising the violence used in Iran‚Äôs 2009 Green Movement protests. Qalibaf ran failed presidential campaigns in 2005, 2013 and 2017, the last of which saw him withdraw in support of the hard-liner Ebrahim Raisi. Raisi later became president and died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and six others. Iran‚Äôs parliament plays a secondary role in governing the country, though it can intensify pressure on a presidential administration when deciding on the annual budget and other important bills. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, has the final say in all important state matters. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, global financial services firm UBS has upgraded Autoliv, Inc. (NYSE: ALV ) stock from Neutral to Buy and increased the price target to $141 from $102. The automotive safety systems manufacturer has shown a solid top-line outperformance relative to light vehicle production, with a 9 percentage point lead in the fiscal year 2023 and around a 6 percentage point lead in the first quarter of 2024. This performance is notably ahead of its peers. Autoliv's margin expansion has also been highlighted as a standout, with a projected increase of 170 basis points for the fiscal year 2024 over 2023. The company's strong balance sheet has been a contributing factor to its stock price rising approximately 15% year-to-date, outperforming the sector by 20%. The firm's financial health and growth have been key factors in the upgraded rating. UBS notes that Autoliv benefits from a degree of insulation from short-term sector concerns such as electric vehicle (EV) market penetration, intensive capital allocation needs, or underexposure to the Chinese market. These advantages position Autoliv favorably in the short, medium, and long term, according to the financial services firm. Despite Autoliv trading at a premium compared to its peers, it is still valued below its own historical price-to-earnings multiples. The company's 12-month forward P/E ratio is currently around 11 times, in contrast to its historical average of approximately 13 times. UBS finds the stock's valuation below historical levels difficult to justify, given Autoliv's record high margins. InvestingPro Insights Following UBS's upgrade of Autoliv, Inc. (NYSE:ALV) to Buy status, a glance at the latest InvestingPro data reveals a company with strong financial metrics that could underpin the firm's positive outlook. Autoliv's market cap stands at a robust $10.23 billion, and its P/E ratio is currently at 19.6, which adjusts to an even more attractive 14.79 on a last twelve months basis as of Q1 2024. This suggests a reasonable valuation relative to the company's earnings. The company's revenue growth has been impressive, with a 15.05% increase over the last twelve months leading up to Q1 2024, and a solid gross profit margin of 17.78% in the same period. Moreover, Autoliv's dividend yield is at a healthy 2.16%, with a dividend growth rate of 3.03% in the last twelve months, marking a continued commitment to returning value to shareholders. Notably, Autoliv has raised its dividend for 3 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 28 consecutive years, according to InvestingPro Tips. For investors seeking additional insights, there are more InvestingPro Tips available, including the observation that 7 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, signaling potential confidence in the company's future performance. To explore these tips and more, visit InvestingPro and consider using the coupon code PRONEWS24 to get an additional 10% off a yearly or biyearly Pro and Pro+ subscription. With 15 additional InvestingPro Tips listed, investors can gain a comprehensive understanding of Autoliv's investment potential.

        "content": "Working out the next number in this maths sequence might just make you tear your hair out. Keeping our minds healthy is just as important as exercising the rest of our bodies. One of the best ways to make sure your brain gets a good workout is to challenge yourself to a range of tricky brain teasers that force you to think differently. And while it might be some people's least favourite subject, a great source of these puzzles is maths. So if you're looking for a challenge today, why not give this puzzle a go? It should be \"simple\" to solve, but it turns out \"many people\" fail to answer it correctly. People struggle to work out baffling clock riddle - but some say it's easy Can you work out this puzzle? ( Image: quiz_riddles/Twitter) The puzzle was posted on X (formerly Twitter ) by the @quiz_riddles account, who wrote alongside it: \"Many people will get this wrong. What is the answer?\" The words were accompanied by a picture of the puzzle, which listed three seemingly easy addition sums, and a fourth one which had not been solved. However, if you look closely at the image above, you'll notice that the sums don't quite give you the answers you'd expect. Alongside 1 + 4 = 5, the puzzle claims that 2 + 5 = 12 and that 3 + 6 = 21. Finally, the puzzle asks you to work out what 8 + 11 should be. Now, we all know that in reality 8 + 11 is 19, but that's not the correct answer for this confusing brain teaser. Do you know what the solution should be? If you're still trying to work it out, don't scroll any further - as we're about to give you the correct answer! Answer The Chase's Darragh Ennis shares 'easy quiz question' which 'everyone gets wrong' 8 + 11 = 96. There are two ways to work this puzzle out. In the first solution, every sum after the first one is correct when you add the previous answer to it. So we know that 1 + 4 = 5, and in order to make 2 + 5 = 12, we must add the 5 from the previous answer. Likewise, 3 + 6 = 21 is correct if the full sum is 3 + 6 + 12. This does mean you have to do some extra working out between the sums, as you need to work out the values of 4 + 7, 5 + 8, 6 + 9, and 7 + 10 before you get to 8 + 11. But if you do it correctly, the full sum should be 8 + 11 + 77, which is 96. A quicker way of solving the puzzle is to do what I did and think outside the box. I noticed that while 2 + 5 doesn't equal 12, 2 x 6 does. The same is true for all the sums, including 1 + 4. If you flip the plus to a multiply and add one to the second number, every sum is correct. And 8 x 12 also gives you 96. Do you have a story to sell? Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.com . Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get ¬£250 but you'll need to act quickly",

        "content": "Pakistan captain Babar Azam is on the cusp of breaking a world record held by Virat Kohli in the 3rd T20I between Pakistan and England on Tuesday. New Delhi: Pakistan captain Babar Azam is on the verge of breaking a world record held by Team India star Virat Kohli in the upcoming third T20I against England on Tuesday, May 28. Pakistan will lock horns with England in the third T20I of the ongoing 4-match series between the two sides at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. Pakistan will be looking to bounce back to winning ways to keep the series alive after a 23-run defeat in the 2nd T20I. While the first T20I was washed out due to rain, England successfully defended the total of 183 runs in the second T20I to go 1-0 up in the three-match series. The hosts rode on captain Jos Buttler‚Äôs brilliant knock of 84 runs to post a strong total on the board before their bowlers produced an excellent effort to bundle out Pakistan for 160 runs and wrap up a dominant win. Babar was the second-highest run-getter for Pakistan in the 2nd T20I as he ended up scoring 32 off 26 balls. However, the Pakistan skipper failed to notch up a big knock to take his team home. Babar is now on the verge of breaking an all-time record held by Kohli and will be looking to achieve the elusive feat during the third T20I in Cardiff. Babar needs only 51 runs to surpass Kohli in becoming the leading run-getter of all time in T20Is. Kohli has 4037 runs under his belt in 117 T20I matches for India whereas Babar has notched up 3987 runs for Pakistan in 118 T20Is. If the Pakistan skipper manages to score 51 runs in the third T20I on Tuesday, he will overtake Kohli in the elite list. Most runs in T20Is: Virat Kohli ‚Äì 4037 runs Babar Azam ‚Äì 3987 runs Rohit Sharma ‚Äì 3974 runs Even if he fails to notch up 51 runs in the third T20I, Babar needs only 13 more runs to become the first Pakistan batter and the second overall to complete 4,000 runs in the shortest format of the game. Babar has been one of the most prolific run-getters for Pakistan in T20Is ever since making his debut in the shortest format in 2016. Pakistan look to avoid series defeat against England After suffering a 23-run defeat in the second T20I, Pakistan will be looking to bounce back to avoid a series defeat against the hosts. With the first T20I getting washed out, a win in the third T20I will give England an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the four-match series. Pakistan batters will look to step up after their disappointing show in the 2nd T20I.",

Under the party‚Äôs plans, local environment experts within the community would sit on the water company boards as non-executive directors to ‚Äúimprove public accountability and transparency‚Äù. The experts would also be expected to hold community meetings to report back on action being taken. In the run-up to the General Election, the Lib Dems have unveiled plans to abolish Ofwat and introduce a new water regulator to tackle the sewage crisis, in addition to banning water CEO bonuses. According to the Environment Agency, sewage spills into England‚Äôs rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023 with 3.6 million hours of spills last year ‚Äì equal to about 400 years ‚Äì compared with 1.75 million hours in 2022. Sir Ed said: ‚ÄúWater companies are getting away with this national sewage scandal whilst Conservative MPs and ministers have just sat on their hands. ‚ÄúThese disgraced firms are destroying our treasured lakes and rivers with their filthy sewage dumping ‚Äì hitting human health, harming our precious environment and damaging the local tourism economy all at the same time. ‚ÄúEnough is enough. It‚Äôs time to get tough on the water industry and a key part of that change must be new ways to hold these firms to account, putting power in the hands of the local communities suffering from this scandal. ‚ÄúLocal environmental experts on company boards could hold water bosses‚Äô feet to the fire and local people would finally have a say in how their water company is run. ‚ÄúLiberal Democrats will have the boldest manifesto plans to end the sewage scandal ‚Äì from a tough new regulator to a ban on greedy exec bonuses to holding water bosses properly to account. ‚ÄúThis election will be about saving our country‚Äôs precious environment for the next generation, not least in special places like the Lake District.‚Äù Sir Ed is visiting the Lake District, where protests have taken place outside the office of water company United Utilities, after it was accused of pumping sewage into Unesco protected lakes. According to Liberal Democrat analysis of Companies House records, United Utilities has made ¬£2.3 billion in operating profits since 2019 and paid their top executives over ¬£2 million in bonuses.",

        "content": "Paris: It was an emotional evening at Court Philippe-Chatrier as the 'King of Clay' Rafael Nadal made a shocking first round exit from Roland Garros after losing to Alexander Zverev. Nadal‚Äôs legacy of record 14 Roland Garros titles is a testament to his sheer quality and industry on clay. At 37, the Spaniard has an illustrious career in tennis to look back at, as he moves closer to retirement which seems imminent, considering his injuries. Even as Alexander Zverev claimed a straight sets victory over the Spaniard, hearts went out to Nadal who, might as well, played his last match of the Grand Slam ever. \"It‚Äôs going to be the last time I‚Äôm here in front of all of you. I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but if it was the last time, then I must say I enjoyed it. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words. For me, it was special to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most,\" said Nadal while addressing the spectators in the stadium. \"I have gone through very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through that recovery process only to be back at Roland Garros. To leave after the first round was not an ideal return. But I have to accept it. I was competitive and I had my chances. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha (Alexander Zverev),\" he averred. He did give the spectators something to cheer for while mentioning a possible return to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics. \"What you all have made me feel here, it‚Äôs unforgettable. I hope to see you again. Merci Beaucoup!\" he conlcuded.",

The officials of CBSL also mentioned that it is expected that the relevant reductions will be provided to the customers by the country‚Äôs financial institutions soon. Meanwhile, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe stated that although the financial institutions have reduced those rates, they have not been reduced to the same extent as the reduction of interest rates of the Central Bank. Speaking at a press conference today (28), he further stated that the interest rates for newly issued loans should be reduced. ‚ÄúThe changes that need to be made for the loans that have been issued by now will happen soon. We are keeping an eye on that. At the same time, we have seen instances where new loans area issued for higher interest rates. But that shouldn‚Äôt happen.

        "content": "What is the hype behind day trading? Why is every other person talking about day trading? All we know is day trading means buying and selling financial instruments like stocks, currencies, futures, etc., but within a span of a single trading day. This is known to be the fastest way of trading but is considered to be a potentially lucrative pursuit. It is not like a long-term investment, where you buy and hold the commodity till the time its price surges, and you sell it for a higher price. In this trading, you depend on the equipment (technology) you use to take a chance in the market in a timely manner. To make it simpler to understand, let‚Äôs give you an example of a Formula One racer racing in a rusty old car. Guess who will win the race? Obviously, the F1 guy. The old car racer needs a finely tuned engine to win the race, just the way a day trader needs an advanced set of tools and platforms to compete in the financial markets. For what purposes will the tools and platforms be beneficial for the traders? The technology you will use will help you with your day trading endeavors. It will help you access live market data, perform trades quickly and efficiently, analyze market trends, and identify opportunities. What Factors Add To The Success Of Day Trading? Let‚Äôs define a successful day trade before diving into the tools needed for successful day trading. A winning day trade involves entering and exiting a position within the same trading day, profiting from a price movement that aligns with your prediction. This can involve buying a stock at a low point and selling it later in the day at a higher price, or vice versa (short selling) if you anticipate the price to fall. To achieve consistent success in day trading, a deep understanding of the financial markets is paramount. This knowledge encompasses two key areas‚Äîunderstanding the market dynamics and technical analysis. Successful day traders develop a keen sense of how various factors influence market behavior. This includes economic data releases, company news events, geopolitical situations, and even investor sentiment. Technical analysis involves studying historical price charts and market indicators to identify potential trading opportunities. Day traders utilize various technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to gauge market momentum, support and resistance levels, and potential trend reversals. Knowledge alone isn‚Äôt enough. Successful day traders translate their market understanding into actionable trading strategies. These strategies outline specific entry and exit points for trades based on technical analysis and defined risk parameters. Here‚Äôs the crucial part: you don‚Äôt just develop a strategy and blindly follow it. Before risking real capital, successful day traders ‚Äúbacktest‚Äù their strategies using historical market data. This allows them to evaluate the strategy‚Äôs potential performance and identify any flaws before deploying it in live trading. The market environment is dynamic, and successful traders continuously refine their strategies based on experience and changing market conditions. Even with a deep understanding of the markets and a well-defined trading strategy, success in day trading hinges on two crucial factors‚Äîdiscipline and risk management. The fast-paced nature of day trading can be emotionally charged. Witnessing sudden price swings can trigger impulses to chase gains or panic-sell at a loss. However, successful day traders cultivate ironclad discipline. They adhere to their pre-defined trading plan, avoiding the temptation to deviate based on emotions. This means entering and exiting trades based on your strategy‚Äôs signals, not fleeting feelings of fear or greed. Risk management is the nail in the coffin of any successful day trading operation. Every trade carries inherent risk, and the key is to limit your potential losses. This is where stop-loss orders become essential. A stop-loss order is an automated instruction set with your agent to sell a security if the price reaches a predetermined level. By setting stop-loss orders on every trade, you establish a maximum amount you‚Äôre willing to lose on that particular position. While it might mean missing out on some potential profits, it prevents catastrophic losses that could wipe out your entire account. Successful day traders also utilize other risk management techniques, such as: What Are Some Essential Tools You Can Use For Day Trading? As we said earlier, one must equip themselves with the right resources to be a successful day trader. If you want to be well-equipped for day trading, follow our three-dimensional approach, which comprises reliable hardware, live market data feed, and a good trading platform. Let‚Äôs have a look at how these can help your day trading go from zero to millions or even billions. What do you perform trade with? A computer, so reliable computer hardware, means an engine of your trading machine. There are multiple checks to make to ensure that you have a reliable system to operate. To make the engine work, consider the following checklist: Just like a pilot needs real-time weather data to fly the plane safely, day traders depend on live market data to make good decisions. A good market data feed provides live quotes, breaking news, and market analysis. You need access to constantly updating stock prices, currency exchange rates, and other relevant market data. Some of the popular data feed providers are Bloomberg, Reuters, and IQ Feed. However, if you want to stay informed about market-moving news events further, you can gain valuable insights from technical analysis tools like Ethereum code offered by some data feed services. Do you know what a trading platform offers you other than currency exchange or commodities? Well, a trading platform acts like a central hub for executing trades. However, it further analyzes the markets and manages your portfolio on your behalf. Here is why you should consider a trading platform: You get access to the charting tools. The advanced charting capabilities will give you a detailed and effective technical analysis. You have to look for a platform that offers different chart types, technical indicators, and drawing tools to help you look for trading opportunities. Popular charting platforms like TradingView can be integrated with some brokers. To be successful in day trading you need a smooth way of order placement and execution. You must ensure your platform allows for various order types (market orders, limit orders, stop-loss orders) and fast order routing for swift trade execution. Some platforms offer built-in research tools like fundamental analysis reports, company news feeds, and earnings calendars, allowing you to make well-rounded trade decisions. Popular platforms with extensive research resources include TD Ameritrade‚Äôs Thinkorswim and Interactive Brokers‚Äô TWS platform. Some Popular Day Trading Platforms Having explored the essential tools, let‚Äôs discuss the best day trading platforms. Choosing the right platform is crucial, as it directly impacts your trading experience and efficiency. Here‚Äôs a list of some popular options: Summing Up Equipping yourself with the right tools and platforms is an essential first step for aspiring day traders. Reliable hardware, real-time market data, and a well-featured trading platform form the foundation for informed decision-making and efficient order execution. Remember, the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù platform doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Äì it depends on your individual needs and trading style. Beyond the tools, consider supplementing your knowledge with educational resources and joining online communities of experienced day traders. Continuous learning and a supportive network can be invaluable assets on your day trading journey.",

        "content": "Home | Hyderabad | Increased Humidity Exacerbates Heat Stress In Hyderabad And Other Metros Cse Report Increased humidity exacerbates heat stress in Hyderabad and other Metros: CSE Report Summer time relative humidity has increased by 5-10 per cent this decade leading to excessive heat stress in Hyderabad and other metros. This increase is nullifying the drop in night temperatures in Hydeabad and Delhi too, a study by the Centre for Science and Environment says. By PTI Published Date - 28 May 2024, 02:33 PM New Delhi: Increased humidity is worsening the heat stress in Hyderabad and other metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Chennai. This particular phenomenon is even nullifying the marginal drop in air temperatures in Hyderabad and Delhi, says a report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). The report says increasing concretization and humidity levels are exacerbating heat stress in India‚Äôs megacities, which are not cooling down at night at the same rate as a decade ago The Centre analysed summer air temperature, land surface temperature, and relative humidity data for six megacities ‚Äî Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai ‚Äî from January 2001 to April 2024. The think tank found that increased humidity is worsening heat stress across all climate zones, even nullifying the marginal drop in air temperatures in Delhi and Hyderabad. Barring Bengaluru, summertime average relative humidity has increased by 5-10 per cent in the other five megacities from 2014-2023 compared to the 2001-2010 average. The CSE report comes at a time when blistering heatwaves are affecting health and livelihoods in large parts of India. ‚ÄúAssessing the changing trend in heat, relative humidity, and land surface temperature along with day and night-time temperatures is necessary to develop a comprehensive heat management plan for urban centres,‚Äù said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at CSE. Avikal Somvanshi, senior programme manager at CSE‚Äôs Urban Lab, said addressing the combination of high heat and humidity is particularly important as it can compromise the human body‚Äôs main cooling mechanism, sweating. ‚ÄúThe evaporation of sweat from the skin cools our bodies, but higher humidity levels limit this natural cooling. As a result, people can suffer heat stress and illness, and the consequences can even be fatal at much lower ambient temperatures,‚Äù he explained. The study showed that megacities are not cooling down at night. The land surface temperature during the summers of 2001-2010 would drop by 6.20-13.20 degrees Celsius from the daytime peak to the nighttime low. In the last 10 summers (2014-2023), night-time cooling has reduced to 6.20-11.50 degrees Celsius, the CSE said. ‚ÄúHot nights are as dangerous as midday peak temperatures. People get little chance to recover from daytime heat if temperatures remain high overnight,‚Äù Somvanshi said. ‚ÄúA study published in ‚ÄòThe Lancet Planetary Health‚Äô noted that the risk of death from excessively hot nights could increase nearly six-fold in the future. This prediction is much higher than the mortality risk from daily average warming suggested by climate change models,‚Äù he said. The study said that rising humidity levels have also made monsoons in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai hotter than pre-monsoon periods. It noted that all megacities have become more concretized in the last two decades, increasing heat stress. The CSE highlighted that an increase in green cover is not effective in mitigating nighttime heat. The study showed that Kolkata has the highest percentage of land under concrete and the lowest green cover among the megacities, while Delhi has the least area under concrete and the maximum green cover. Green cover has declined in Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. The built-up area in Chennai has doubled in the last two decades, while its green cover shrank by almost 14 percentage points.

        "description": "The industry regulator Ofwat is set to reject most water companies‚Äô requests to increase consumer annual bills, it is claimed",
        "content": "Industry regulator Ofwat is set to reject most water companies‚Äô requests to increase consumer bills, it has been reported. Ofwat is due to announce its draft decisions on its 2024 price review which will set the levels of service water customers can expect and the bills they will pay for 2025 to 2030. The announcement, which comes amid mounting public anger over water companies‚Äô handling of sewage pollution, will also include a decision on Thames Water‚Äôs bill increase and spending plans. What have water firms asked for? Water firms in England and Wales have reportedly declared they want to increase bills by between 24 per cent and 91 per cent over the next five years, according to a consumer watchdog. That is despite sewage spills into England‚Äôs rivers a nd seas more than doubling in 2023. Southern Water is asking for the biggest increase of 91 per cent, which would mean its customers‚Äô bills would rise from the current level of ¬£479 to ¬£915 per year, according to the Consumer Council for Water (CCW). South Staffordshire and Cambridge Water are requesting the lowest rise ‚Äì of 24 per cent ‚Äì which equates to a ¬£43 rise in their bills. What is Ofwat expected to say? A hotly anticipated review of how expensive water bills could be over the coming years has been pushed back because of the general election Ofwat has delayed publication of its decision on pricing until 11 July from an original date of 12 June. The consultation will see Ofwat give its initial verdict on water companies‚Äô business plans until the end of the decade, which it does every five years. But according to The Guardian , the regulator is poised to refuse most water companies‚Äô requests to raise consumer bills, with some getting only half of what they want. The regulator says the new price controls set as part of its 2024 review will still come into effect on April 1 2025, despite the later publication date for its draft decisions. What does this mean for bills? It‚Äôs not yet clear which companies have had their requests turned down or how much of their proposed bill increases have been rejected. But according to The Guardian , Thames Water‚Äôs request to increase bills by 59 per cent to ¬£749 a year have been rejected by Ofwat, with sources describing the firm‚Äôs business plans as ‚Äúfag-packet figures‚Äù and a ‚Äúmicrowave job‚Äù. They added that Thames Water‚Äôs board members were determined to ‚Äúsit on a deckchair on the Titanic‚Äù. A Thames Water spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOfwat has announced that its draft determination will be delayed until after the general election in July and so any comment about its content before that would be premature‚Äù. Why is Thames Water in trouble? The future of Britain‚Äôs biggest water firm, Thames Water , could hinge on the decision with the giant the most heavily indebted of England and Wales‚Äô water companies. When the company was privatised in 1989, it had no debt, but has since borrowed heavily. Thames Water has a roughly ¬£15 billion debt and, along with the other water companies, has become embroiled in a scandal over water pollution. It faces potential nationalisation after investors rowed back on a promise to provide extra funding, putting the company‚Äôs finances in the balance. Thames has asked Ofwat to allow it to hike customer bills over the next five years to help it invest in its infrastructure and balance the books. What about other utility bills? Households across England, Wales and Scotland are set to pay less on their energy bills from July after energy regular Ofgem has announced its quarterly price cap . Read Next How the 'triple lock plus' would affect your pension The average household energy bill is to fall by 7 per cent after Ofgem lowered its price cap in response to wholesale prices. The typical household‚Äôs energy bill is set to fall from the current ¬£1,690 a year to ¬£1,568. This will be ¬£500 less than the cap in July last year, when it was ¬£2,074, but Labour have pointed out it is still ¬£400 more than in 2021. And analysts have warned the regulator could increase the price cap on bills in October. The Tories have said they would keep the energy price cap in every year of the next parliament and introduce improved customer service to help consumers find cheaper energy bills and drive up competition. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said, if elected, a government led by him would set up Great British Energy, a new publicly owned energy company, which would ‚Äúinvest in homegrown clean energy to boost energy independence and cut bills for good‚Äù.",

        "description": "Three European nations are set to recognise Palestinian statehood as a rift widens between the EU and Israel, whose military operation continues in Gaza.",
        "content": "Spain has moved to formally recognise a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit in a co-ordinated effort by the three western European nations. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading Israel has slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognise a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting as a European Union rift with Israel widens. Ireland and Norway were also to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state later in the day. \"This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,\" Sanchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sanchez's government was \"being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes\". While dozens of countries have recognised a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived on Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take action against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition of a Palestinian state. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel's air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the October 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries - more than two-thirds of the United Nations - recognise a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu's government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sanchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was \"a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship\". He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the October 7 attack that triggered Israel's response.

This trend is supported by the robust market for cancer treatments and other high-potency medications like antibody conjugates, steroids, and IV fluids. The rising prevalence of diabetes, with over 422 million people affected globally, also contributes significantly to this demand. For example, in April 2021, Catalent expanded its biologics packaging capacity with a US$ 14 million investment in its Indiana facility. Technological Advancements in Packaging Technological advancements in packaging machinery and materials are shaping the global contract pharmaceutical packaging market. Innovations in automation, materials science, and sustainability are creating significant market opportunities. Modern packaging technology, including advanced robotic systems, electronic controls, and real-time monitoring, enhances precision, efficiency, and reduces human errors. For instance, in June 2020, PCI Pharma partnered with Experic to explore clinical and commercial manufacturing, packaging, and supply chain services. Segment Analysis Plastic & Polymer Dominance Plastics and polymers are expected to dominate the market with over 30% share during the forecast period. Plastic bottles are preferred due to their lightweight, space-saving, and cost-efficient nature. For example, Aphena Pharma Solutions announced in January 2021 the construction of ten high-speed bottling lines, with plans to add 30 more lines to increase capacity to over 80 million bottles monthly. Geographical Penetration North America Leads the Market North America holds over 35% of the global market share, driven by the presence of numerous contract packaging service providers.

Regulatory flexibilities and expedited approvals supported the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Contract packaging facilities implemented safety measures to continue operations during the pandemic. Russia-Ukraine War Impact The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, both key players in the pharmaceutical supply chain, disrupts the availability and pricing of packaging materials. Transportation disruptions, export prohibitions, and trade restrictions cause global shortages and price instability, impacting contract packaging companies' ability to meet demand. Key Developments ‚Ä¢December 2022: Nelipak Corporation opened a flexible packaging production facility in North Carolina. ‚Ä¢October 2022: Aphena Pharma Solutions completed a US$ 20 million expansion in Tennessee. ‚Ä¢October 2020: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals partnered with Sharp for packaging its RNAi therapeutic medicines for European markets.

        "content": "HONOR has announced two new smartphones , the HONOR 200 series. The devices that were announced are the HONOR 200 and HONOR 200 Pro . HONOR announced the two phones in China, as this is their initial launch. Both are expected to launch globally too, though. The HONOR 200 series is official, and the phones are coming to global markets Chances are that both smartphones will be identical globally, but with different software, of course. So this initial launch does reveal all the detail that you may be wondering about. If you take a look at the two devices below, you‚Äôll see that they‚Äôre similar, but also different. You can easily tell which is which by their display holes. The HONOR 200 has a display camera hole, while the HONOR 200 Pro has a pill-shaped cutout on the display. Everything else is very similar, though. They both have curved displays with very thin bezels. There‚Äôs also an oval camera island on the back, in the top-left corner. Their backplates are rounded at the very edges. In regards to specs, these are mid-range phones, but very powerful mid-range phones... especially the HONOR 200 Pro. Let‚Äôs talk about that device first, shall we? The HONOR 200 Pro is fueled by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC The HONOR 200 Pro includes a 6.78-inch 2700 x 1224 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.

An in-display fingerprint scanner is also a part of the package. The phone also includes a set of stereo speakers, and Bluetooth 5.3. It measures 163.3 x 75.2 x 8.2mm and weighs 199 grams. The HONOR 200 Pro‚Äôs pricing starts at CNY3,499 ($483) in China. The HONOR 200 has a 120Hz display & Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chip The vanilla HONOR 200, on the flip side, has a 6.7-inch 2664 x 1200 OLED display. That panel is also curved, and it also has a 120Hz refresh rate. It gets just as bright as the HONOR 200 Pro panel, and it has the same 3,840Hz high-frequency PWM dimming. The Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 fuels this smartphone, while both 12GB and 16GB LPDDR5 RAM models are available. Those two variants include 256GB and 512GB of internal storage, respectively.

        "content": "A gut health expert has issued a warning about a popular supplement. Sea moss has gained in popularity due to its high fibre content. However, Chris Dubberley said there were \"hidden dangers\" of sea moss, particularly its iodine content. Chris has urged consumers to approach it with caution due to its potential implications for gut and thyroid health. Chris said: \"Sea moss supplements are gaining popularity for their supposed health benefits. Although the high fibre content in sea moss could benefit digestion for some, too much may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, such as bloating and diarrhoea. \"The iodine found in sea moss also poses some concern for gut health. Although it‚Äôs necessary for thyroid function, too much iodine can upset the balance of gut bacteria, leading to gastrointestinal problems, as well as - ironically - hypothyroidism. \"Sea moss also includes prebiotics, which support gut health by growing helpful bacteria. However, too much prebiotic can worsen symptoms for those with certain gut conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). \"Taking care of your gut health needs a personalised approach. Everyone has a unique digestive system with their own dietary likes, sensitivities, and health conditions. This is important to keep in mind when thinking about trying sea moss supplements. \"Before picking sea moss supplements, be careful because the iodine content can vary greatly between products. It's important that these supplements have clear labels showing how much iodine they contain so people can make informed decisions about their health.\"",

        "content": "A DERMATOLOGIST has revealed the three most effective ingredients to include in skincare routines for defying the signs of aging. She said beauty products should be used consistently to achieve optimal results. Dermatologist Nancy Wickford shared tips for slowing the signs of aging (stock image) Credit: Getty Nancy Wickford is a skincare specialist and dermatologist at the UK-based brand HelloSKIN. Speaking to The U.S. Sun, she shared must-try tips for maintaining a youthful appearance. BEAUTY BASICS Wickford said a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, SPF, and occasional exfoliation can benefit skin health at every age. She said hydrogel eye masks target the delicate areas around the eyes, prone to dryness, fine lines, and wrinkles. She suggested HelloSKIN‚Äôs Hydrating Hydrogel Eye masks for reducing the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, and crow‚Äôs feet. The $16 masks contain hyaluronic acid and the Korean complex Botaniceutical Plus-10. ‚ÄúIn the 20s and 30s, hydrogel eye masks can be used as a preventative measure to keep the eye area supple and hydrated,‚Äù Wickford said. ‚ÄúIn the 40s and beyond, when signs of aging become more apparent, these masks can help to minimize the look of existing fine lines and wrinkles while delivering intense hydration and nourishment to the delicate eye area.‚Äù Most read in Hair & Beauty Hailey Bieber loves a $380 anti-aging serum ‚Äì I found a dupe I think is better with matching ingredients & it‚Äôs 20% off SKINCARE STAPLES Wickford said patience is necessary when treating fine lines and wrinkles as it can take weeks or months to see results. She warned against using retinoids alongside harsh scrubs as she shared three ingredients that transform aging skin. ‚ÄúRetinoids: These vitamin A derivatives help increase cell turnover and stimulate collagen production,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúStart with a low-concentration retinol serum or cream and gradually increase strength as your skin builds tolerance. ‚ÄúUse at night and follow with a moisturizer. ‚ÄúHydrating face serum: Look for serums containing hyaluronic acid, which can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, plumping and hydrating the skin to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, such as helloSKIN‚Äôs Hydration Serum. ‚ÄúAntioxidant serums: Vitamins C and E help neutralize free radicals that contribute to premature aging. ‚ÄúUse a potent antioxidant serum in the morning under sunscreen.‚Äù What is hyaluronic acid? Healthline describes hyaluronic acid as a glycosaminoglycan naturally found in the body‚Äôs connective tissue. It keeps water molecules on the surfaces of the skin for a hydrated appearance. Hyaluronic acid reduces the appearance of wrinkles and improves wound healing. FLAWLESS FACE Wickford said professional salon treatments such as facials should be used alongside home skincare routines rather than as a replacement. ‚ÄúProfessional facials can help combat signs of aging by deeply exfoliating, hydrating, and infusing the skin with potent anti-aging ingredients,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre concerned about wrinkles, age spots, and loss of firmness, getting a facial every 4-6 weeks can be beneficial in maintaining a more youthful, radiant complexion.‚Äù YOUTHFUL GLOW The dermatologist said several lifestyle factors can potentially reverse the signs of aging. These include regular exercise for flexibility, cardiovascular health, and improved muscle tone. Also, quitting smoking, protecting the skin from sun exposure, and maintaining a healthy weight. ‚ÄúA balanced, nutrient-rich diet high in antioxidants from fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats can combat oxidative stress and inflammation linked to aging,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAdequate sleep, stress management through practices like meditation or yoga, and staying socially engaged can also positively impact physical and cognitive function.‚Äù Buy it now *If you click on a link in this boxout we may earn affiliate revenue Hydrating Hydrogel Eye masks, $16, HelloSKIN Hydration Serum, $27, HelloSKIN HORRIFIC HACKS Wickford said three popular anti-aging hacks on social media should be avoided as they lack scientific evidence and could be harmful. ‚ÄúWhile vitamin C is beneficial for anti-aging, using undiluted lemon juice can cause severe irritation, dryness, and sometimes chemical burns on the skin due to its low pH level,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSome people claim that the hydrocortisone in hemorrhoid creams can reduce puffiness and wrinkles around the eyes. ‚ÄúHowever, I‚Äôd always suggest avoiding using them under your eyes these creams are not formulated for the delicate eye area and can cause severe irritation, thinning of the skin, and other side effects.‚Äù She also advised against DIY dermaplanning to remove dead skin cells and peach fuzz. ‚ÄúAttempting this at home with improper tools or technique can lead to cuts, scarring, and infection, please always leave this to a professional,‚Äù she said. Wickford said hydrogel eye masks can reduce puffiness, dark circles, and crow‚Äôs feet Credit: HelloSkin Publisher",

The energy bureaus of all coal-producing provinces, coal industry management departments and relevant central enterprises should step up their efforts to promote the intelligence level of coal mines to a broader scope and to provide strong support for ensuring the safe and stable supply of coal and building a new energy system, it said in a notice on Monday. Production coal mines with an annual output of 3 million metric tons or more are encouraged to comprehensively promote the intelligent transformation of major production processes, it said. The administration also encourages companies and local energy bureaus to continuously improve the autonomous operation capability of production systems, including unmanned operations in fixed locations and the application of robots in hazardous and labor-intensive positions, it said.",

        "content": "China's former Olympic champion swimmer Sun Yang has reiterated his ambition of coming back to compete as strong as ever after his doping ban of over four years finished on Tuesday. Sun, a former three-time freestyle Olympic champion, technically regained his eligibility to compete in an official race again on May 28 after completing a suspension of four years and three months, issued by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, that took effect from Feb 28, 2020. Sun, who turned 32 in December, said during an exclusive interview with ThePaper.cn that he's never given up on his athletic career throughout the tough years and he's ready to come back as a competitive swimmer again. \"I'd decided four years ago (when the suspension was imposed) that I would not quit. Now I just hope to be back in the pool and to step back on the starting blocks again as soon as possible,\" Sun said during the interview. Sun's controversial doping case dated back to September 2018 when a dispute with testers from IDTM, a FINA-hired agency, over the authorization of a random out-of-competition drugs test at his residence in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province escalated into a physical confrontation. Swimming's world governing body World Aquatics (then known as FINA) ruled in January 2019 that Sun's refusal to cooperate was reasonable based on results of an independent panel's investigation that found the IDTM testers failed to show adequate proof of identification and authorization, as claimed by Sun. Two months later, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the FINA ruling to CAS, resulting in an 11-hour public hearing in November 2019 in Swiss city Montreux. There, a panel of three judges determined Sun was guilty and imposed the eight-year ban in February 2020. The Swiss supreme court set aside the ban in December of that year following a successful appeal by Sun's attorney that challenged the neutrality of Franco Frattini, chairman of the original CAS panel, who was deemed to display anti-China bias in comments posted by the Italian on social media. The second hearing, as required by the Swiss court, took place in May 2021 overseen by a new panel of judges, who found that Sun \"had acted recklessly\" when he refused to let anti-doping officials leave his home with a sample of his blood. Sun had repeatedly protested his innocence during the protracted legal dispute. He claimed that he refused to cooperate only after finding testers were operating without adequate ID proof and were taking photos of him without his permission during what was supposed to be a confidential procedure. The Lausanne-based CAS announced in June 2021 to reduce the initial eight-year ban into four years and three months, citing rule amendments that allow flexibility to assess the \"entirety of the circumstances\". \"At the beginning (of the suspension), I suffered a lot emotionally and mentally, feeling nothing but darkness. My parents almost tried to satisfy every one of my demands at that moment, worrying that I would suffer a mental problem,\" Sun confessed. \"Then slowly and gradually, I managed to come out of the shadows, learned to appreciate and enjoy other things in my life, got married, went back to university to continue my academic studies. \"Looking back now, I feel I've gained a lot more than what I've lost during the four years. \"Now I've left it all behind, made peace with what happened in the past and am ready to give it a go again,\" said Sun, who won two gold medals (400m and 1,500m free) at London 2012, followed by a 200m gold at Rio 2016.",

        "content": "China Eastern Airlines on Tuesday took delivery of its sixth C919 jet, as the domestically developed large passenger aircraft celebrates the 1st anniversary of commercial operations. C919 jets have reportedly carried nearly 300,000 passengers during the past 12 months, accumulating over 6,000 incident-free flight hours, achieving preliminary success in commercial operations. Industry analysts said the mass production and delivery of C919s is advancing steadily, projecting Chinese aircraft manufacturers may reach the same level as international industry leaders by 2035, in terms of aircraft production capacity and technical support and maintenance. On Tuesday morning, a C919 aircraft numbered B-919G departed from Shanghai Pudong International Airport and landed at Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport shortly. The plane formally joined China Eastern Airlines' fleet, according to a press release the airliner sent to the Global Times. This is the first of a purchase order of 100 C919s that China Eastern Airlines signed with Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in September 2023, the company said. Since the C919's inaugural commercial flight on May 28, 2023, its commercial operation has picked up speed. Over the past year, the aircraft began flying routes between Shanghai and Beijing, operating across the Chinese Lunar New Year travel rush and debuted at the Singapore Airshow. A chartered flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai is scheduled for Jun 1, which will mark C919's first overseas commercial flight, according to China Eastern Airlines. Analysts said large-scale operation of C919s is significant to promote China's competitiveness in the global aviation market. \"Over the past year, C919's commercial operations made notable progress, carrying a large number of passengers and conducting test flights on more routes. Especially, the aircraft's debut at the Singapore Airshow underlies COMAC's resolve in exploring international markets,\" Wang Yanan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In addition to China Eastern Airlines, other major domestic carriers such as Air China and China Southern Airlines have also announced purchase of C919s from COMAC. To date, global orders of C919 have exceeded 1,000 aircraft, Xinhua News Agency reported. \"Currently, C919 has sufficient orders while the C929 project has begun, which points to the sound development of the country's air transport and aircraft manufacturing sector,\" Qi Qi, an independent market analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Qi calls for the accelerated development of aircraft industrial and supply chains domestically, especially stable supply such as engines and avionics, in a bid to boost the mass production of C919 jets. COMAC Deputy General Manager Qi Xuefeng said in November 2023 that the C929 aircraft has entered its detailed design stage. The manufacturing of large aircraft should give play to the activity of domestic and foreign suppliers, but we should strive to achieve a safe and self-controllable industrial and supply chain at the most for the mass production of every aircraft model, Qi said. It's expected that Chinese aircraft manufacturers will reach the same level as international giants such as Boeing and Aircraft as early as 2035 in terms of output, technical support and maintenance, Wang said. He said the progress made by the C919 is a vivid display of China's fruitful results in high-end manufacturing, and the continuing momentum will help the country retain its leading position in global competition. China has demonstrated its strong momentum and broad prospects in the development of new quality productive forces. China's first domestically produced large cruise ship, Adora Magic City, started commercial operations in January this year, another showcase of the country's manufacturing prowess.",

        "description": "A woman whose husband went 'AWOL' during a boozy night with friends was shocked by his response when she said she was 'upset', and now fears family life might not be for him",
        "content": "A mum was left in a state of bewilderment when her husband went \"AWOL\" while enjoying time with his friends. With two young children at home, aged four and six months, she was understandably worried about his \"zero contact\" approach while out on a session that lasted from the afternoon into the early hours. Taking her concerns to Mumsnet , the woman recounted how she had \"forgiven him for a lot over the years\". She sought the opinions of fellow users, delving into the details of his behaviour. She wrote: \"I woke up with the baby in the early hours and he wasn't home, so I sent a message asking where he was. No reply. Up with baby again about an hour and a half later, again no reply. Tried to call with the next wake up, didn't pick up. By this point it was about 5.30am - everything would have been closed. He went out in the afternoon. Read More Related Articles People are just learning that tiny balconies with no floor have 'fantastic' use \"If he'd have responded 'in a bar/at friend's house, be home later' or just ANYTHING it would've been fine, but it was the ignoring that bothered me. He would've just not come home with zero contact if I hadn't pushed it. \"The next time I woke with baby (we're both ill with Covid and she's exclusively breastfeeding, so I've done all night feeds for 6 months and am knackered/feeling s**t) I sent a message saying I was locking the front door. Miraculously he responded straight away. He claimed he had been trying to get home for 'hours' but his bank cards had been 'blocked'. \"I told him how upset/angry I was and that he should have just messaged me, etc. etc., and he told me I was 'locking him out of his home' and that 'this is your decision, not mine' - as if I'm ending the relationship. Feels like he's trying to push me to leave.\" The woman told him she was \"upset\", calling him \"irresponsible\" because he's 36 - and his cruel five-word response was \"cry me a f**king river\". She was wondering \"if his story is true\", why would he have ghosted her. \"Also, he could've gone home with friends who live in the same direction or asked one of them to book him an Uber and pay them back,\" she fumed. \"Also thinking if it's true, he's blown an awful lot of money...Why else would his cards stop working other than the accounts being emptied?\" Read More Related Articles Woman's 'inspirational' tattoo goes viral for all the wrong reasons She said he hadn't yet \"made an appearance\" and she'd had to lie to her eldest child saying he was \"having a sleepover with his friend\". When she spoke to her friend, they said \"it comes across like he just doesn't care\" about her, or \"being a family man\". The woman is now worried he wants the \"single lifestyle over his family\". She added: \"I wouldn't mind as much if this was a one-off, but he's got form for irresponsible partying-type behaviour and, like I said, has pulled disappearing acts before. But then part of me thinks maybe I am just going crazy and being harsh.\" Online commenters were left bewildered by her situation, questioning why she remained with him. A commenter responded: \"Get him out, because he's vile, and enjoy your life.\" Another declared: \"Overreacting? Hardly. I very rarely say this but I would be thinking very carefully about this relationship. You say you've forgiven him a lot over the years. It sounds as if that has encouraged him to behave worse and worse rather than feel grateful for your forbearance. \"Also, I would be very suspicious that he's not just drinking on these binges [...] In short, I'd be keeping that door locked a while and have a hard think.\" And another added: \"I'd go f**king mental. I just wouldn't tolerate this. I'd have his bags packed and on the doorstep awaiting his arrival.\"",

        "content": "Pune (Maharashtra) [India], May 28: In the ever-evolving landscape of the construction industry, the shift towards digital transformation is not just a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. As a AECO software & services company at the forefront of innovation, we understand the pivotal role technology plays in not just enhancing operational efficiency but also in driving significant cost savings. Among the myriad of technological advancements, cloud-based Construction ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems stand out as a game-changer for businesses in the construction sector. The Financial Edge of Cloud-Based Construction ERP: Reduced IT Infrastructure and Maintenance Costs Traditional ERP systems necessitate substantial upfront investment in IT infrastructure, including servers, storage, and an in-house IT team to manage and maintain this hardware. Cloud-based ERP solutions, on the other hand, eliminate these expenses. Hosted on the provider‚Äôs servers and accessed via the internet, they significantly reduce the need for physical hardware and the costs associated with its upkeep. This shift not only cuts down capital expenditure but also converts it into a predictable operational expense. Enhanced Scalability and Flexibility The construction industry is characterized by its dynamic nature, with the scale of operations constantly changing. Cloud-based ERP systems offer unparalleled scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust their usage based on current needs without the need for physical hardware changes. This scalability ensures that companies pay only for what they use, optimizing expenses and improving financial flexibility. Improved Data Accuracy and Decision-Making Data is the lifeblood of decision-making in the construction industry. Cloud-based ERP systems provide real-time data access and analytics, empowering businesses with accurate information for timely decision-making. This immediacy not only improves project outcomes but also reduces costly delays and rework, directly impacting the bottom line. Streamlined Processes and Increased Productivity By integrating various business processes, from project management to finance and HR, cloud-based ERP systems create a cohesive workflow. This integration eliminates data silos, streamlines processes, and significantly enhances productivity. The efficiency gained translates into faster project completion times and reduced labor costs, contributing to overall financial health. Enhanced Security and Compliance Data security and regulatory compliance are critical concerns for the construction industry. Cloud-based ERP providers invest heavily in security measures, including data encryption and regular backups, ensuring that sensitive information is well-protected. Additionally, these systems are updated regularly to comply with the latest regulations, reducing the risk of costly legal penalties and protecting your company‚Äôs reputation. The adoption of cloud-based Construction ERP systems is more than just a step towards digital transformation; it‚Äôs a strategic move that promises significant financial benefits. From slashing IT-related expenses to enhancing operational efficiency, the financial advantages are compelling. As a construction software company, we are committed to empowering our clients with solutions that not only meet the demands of today but also pave the way for a more profitable and efficient future. Embracing cloud-based ERP is not just an investment in technology‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment in your company‚Äôs financial health and competitive edge. https://softtechglobal.com If you have any objection to this press release content, kindly contact pr.error.rectification@gmail.com to notify us.

        "content": "Message from His Excellency Dr. Omar Alieu Touray, President of the ECOWAS Commission Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens of ECOWAS Member States, Today marks the 49th anniversary of the signing of the treaty that gave birth to the Economic Community of West African States. Over nearly half a century, ECOWAS has stood as a beacon of regional cooperation, fostering shared prosperity and unity among our diverse peoples. As we commemorate this milestone, let us reflect on the remarkable achievements that ECOWAS has accomplished. From facilitating the free movement of people to promoting intra-regional trade, enhancing energy and transport infrastructure, advancing governance, and bolstering peace and security, ECOWAS has made tangible strides toward our collective vision of a peaceful and prosperous region. Yet, even as we celebrate our successes, we cannot ignore the challenges that persist. Insecurity remains a pressing concern, with some member states grappling with the daily threat of terrorism and the resulting displacement and food insecurity affecting large segments of our population. In the face of these challenges, our unity is paramount. It is our collective strength that will enable us to overcome adversity and safeguard the integrity of our community. As General Yakubu Gowon, one of ECOWAS‚Äô founding fathers, aptly remarked, the breakup of our community would be a grievous disservice to past, present, and future generations. Therefore, let us rally together under the theme of ‚ÄúStrengthening Regional Unity, Peace, and Security.‚Äù This theme underscores the urgent need to preserve the unity and peace envisioned by ECOWAS‚Äô founding fathers and reaffirms our commitment to working tirelessly toward these cherished objectives. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to our leaders, past and present, as well as to the dedicated members of our community and our valued partners, both local and international. It is through our collective efforts and unwavering unity that we will secure the peace and stability of our member states and pave the way for the harmonious socio-economic development of our region. In unity, there is strength. Let us remain steadfast in our resolve to uphold the ideals of ECOWAS and ensure a brighter future for generations to come. On this auspicious occasion, I wish our ECOWAS community and all its members a joyous anniversary. Long live ECOWAS! Long live African unity!",

        "content": "Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh government has ordered the closure of 66 nursing colleges across the state, three months after the Madhya Pradesh High Court's order over 'irregularities' in affiliation. The state's medical education department has issued a circular to district administration asking them to comply with the order. The action follows the directives of Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, to take strict action. The state government said that the Madhya Pradesh High Court has declared these colleges 'unsuitable', and subsequently, action for shutting them has been taken. The government, however, has also made it clear that students enrolled with these 66 colleges would not be affected. \"Students of these colleges would not be affected. Their exams would be conducted,\" a statement from the medical education department, read. The development came even as the nursing college scam case is being heard in the high court. The case is about large-scale irregularities and corruption in nursing colleges. The CBI has been carrying out the investigation. The CBI had submitted its reports (charge sheet) on 308 nursing colleges, while the probe in another 300 nursing colleges was underway. Meanwhile, two officials of Madhya Pradesh Police -- inspectors Sushil Kumar Majoka and Rishikant Asathe, who were earlier attached to the CBI -- were arrested two weeks ago. Their arrest on an alleged bribery charge has raised multiple questions about the authenticity of the probe. The nursing college scam was exposed in 2021 and it reached the Madhya Pradesh High Court in 2023.",

        "content": "Scottie Scheffler arrives to the course during the second round of the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 17, 2024. Ben Jared | PGA Tour | Getty Images A Louisville, Kentucky, police detective violated department policy by not activating his body camera during his controversial arrest of Scottie Scheffler last week when the top-ranked golfer was trying to drive into the PGA Championship venue, the city's police chief said Thursday. Detective Bryan Gillis \"should have turned on his body-worn camera but did not,\" Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said at a press conference. \"This officer has received corrective action for this policy violation\" because of the seriousness of the violation, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg at the press conference announced the release of video footage from the Friday morning incident showing the moments after Gillis arrested the 27-year-old Scheffler for allegedly assaulting him with his car as the golfer drove around other vehicles. The footage came from a pole camera and a police car dashboard camera. The video from the pole camera shows Gillis running after Scheffler's car as it slowly turns from behind several large vehicles, the detective slamming his hand or arm against the golfer's car, and Scheffler immediately stopping. Gillis and other cops then pulled him out and placed him into handcuffs about 50 seconds later. The video does not capture the seconds before that which Gillis reported included him being dragged by Scheffler's car. Greenberg said that \"activating body-worn cameras is critically important to our police department.\" Louisville Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, right, speaks to reporter as Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg listens at left during a press...

Ben Jared | PGA Tour | Getty Images A Louisville, Kentucky, police detective violated department policy by not activating his body camera during his controversial arrest of Scottie Scheffler last week when the top-ranked golfer was trying to drive into the PGA Championship venue, the city's police chief said Thursday. Detective Bryan Gillis \"should have turned on his body-worn camera but did not,\" Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said at a press conference. \"This officer has received corrective action for this policy violation\" because of the seriousness of the violation, Gwinn-Villaroel said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg at the press conference announced the release of video footage from the Friday morning incident showing the moments after Gillis arrested the 27-year-old Scheffler for allegedly assaulting him with his car as the golfer drove around other vehicles. The footage came from a pole camera and a police car dashboard camera. The video from the pole camera shows Gillis running after Scheffler's car as it slowly turns from behind several large vehicles, the detective slamming his hand or arm against the golfer's car, and Scheffler immediately stopping. Gillis and other cops then pulled him out and placed him into handcuffs about 50 seconds later. The video does not capture the seconds before that which Gillis reported included him being dragged by Scheffler's car. Greenberg said that \"activating body-worn cameras is critically important to our police department.\" Louisville Police Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, right, speaks to reporter as Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg listens at left during a press...

        "content": "‚ÄòI think it‚Äôs quite sad that she‚Äôs had to turn the comments off on that video‚Äô Molly-Mae and Zoe on their way to Ibiza Molly-Mae Hague‚Äôs sister Zoe has said the reality star ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do right from wrong‚Äù after she was criticised for booking a Ryanair flight for her hen after treating her best friend to a private jet. Molly-Mae had organised the ‚Äúbest weekend ever‚Äù for her sister Zoe as she whisked her and ten friends off to Ibiza to celebrate on the party island. But critics were quick to point out that the 24-year-old fianceÃÅ of Tommy Fury had used a private jet in March to take her best friend Tayla on a four-day ski trip in France to celebrate her birthday. It attracted comments such as, ‚Äúyour friend gets a private jet for her birthday but your sister doesn't for her hen's party? I'd be raging.‚Äù Another sniped: ‚ÄúMakes me giggle that her mate got a private jet but it's Ryanair for her sister.‚Äù Zoe defends her sister But now, Zoe has uploaded a new YouTube video where she declared: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to say anything, I‚Äôm sure you guys know me well enough now to know what I think about that.‚Äù Referring to Molly-Mae, she added: ‚ÄúPoor girl can‚Äôt do right from wrong, she really can‚Äôt. I think it‚Äôs quite sad that she‚Äôs had to turn the comments off on that video.‚Äù She ended by saying: ‚ÄúPeace and love over here, peace and love only, no hate, I love my sister and she loves me.‚Äù When she was then asked if she wanted a staycation or a hen do abroad she answered: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go abroad, I feel like everyone needs some sun at this time of year as well, the only thing is when we looked at flights ages and ages ago, the flights were about ¬£520.‚Äù ‚ÄúObviously, ¬£520 for a return flight is a lot of money, however, Molly was so generous and very kind and said that no one has to pay for anything else, that‚Äôs literally all they‚Äôll have to pay for then potentially a little bit of spending money. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know all of this until we got there, but everyone was really generous and chipped in where they could. ‚ÄúMy friends that just paid for their flights also all sent me a bit of money to send to Molly as like a thank you and a little bit of a contribution towards the food and stuff.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, all in all, it cost about ¬£700, which for some people for a hen do is quite a lot, I know it is quite a lot, but they were all saying ‚ÄòFor the experience we‚Äôre gonna get and for the villa that we‚Äôre staying in and the food we‚Äôre getting and drinks that we‚Äôre getting‚Äô, they were reasonably happy to do it.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did check with everyone before we booked anything to check this was going to be okay for everyone and it was.‚Äù ‚ÄúA lot of the questions were ‚ÄòHow did you split everything?‚Äô ‚ÄòHow did you pay bills at the end?‚Äô and we‚Äôre very fortunate that we didn‚Äôt have to and that Molly did get the majority of it,‚Äù she explained. Last week, a frustrated Molly-Mae Hague said she ‚Äúcan't win‚Äù after she was criticised for booking Ryanair. The sisters having fun on the hen Molly-Mae uploaded a video to her YouTube channel to address the backlash where she said she ‚Äúcan't win‚Äù no matter what she does. She even joked she will ‚Äúswim, bike and run‚Äù to her next location to keep her critics happy. ‚ÄúPeople talking about how they thought it was crazy that I booked my sister a Ryanair flight to take her on her hen do,‚Äù she says in the video. ‚ÄúThey're like 'I can't believe Molly booked a Ryanair flight for her and her sister's friends when a few weeks before she got her friend a jet. ‚ÄúThe amount of stick and the amount of intense comments I got from doing that treat for Tayla's birthday and getting the jet, made me think I probably won't ever do that ever again. ‚ÄúIt takes away that specialness of that experience because the reaction is just, so not worth it.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúBecause if I fly commercial, well, it was actually making me feel like I was the worst sister in the entire world. Then, if I fly private, it is genuinely not worth it because it's all I hear about for that next few weeks. ‚ÄúWhat I'll do is I will do a triathlon. You will see me swimming, biking and running to my next location. She wrapped up by saying: ‚ÄúThere's so much going on in the world right now? A, why do people even care? and B, you can't win, you can't actually win. No matter what I do people are going to comment about it. In March, the star jetted 12 friends off on a private jet for a luxury getaway to mark her bestie Tayla Blue's 30th birthday in France. The former reality star surprised Tayla just a week before they flew out to the French Alps with an envelope saying the pair were going skiing. The influencer had organised for Tayla's husband, their baby, her sister and other friends to come along on the trip. Molly-Mae's fianceÃÅ Tommy Fury, their baby daughter Bambi, 14 months, and Molly's sister Zoe Hague also joined the celebrations. Tayla was seen walking onto the private jet with Hague before all their friends yelled surprise from inside the plane cabin.",

        "content": "Southampton emerged victorious from the Championship play-off final , sealing a return to the top flight at the expense of the Whites. Cooper, the longest serving player on Leeds‚Äô books, watched on from the bench as an unused substitute. Members of the Leeds squad opted against speaking post-match, but Cooper has now issued a brief statement via social media to address the defeat. Posting on X , formerly Twitter, he said: ‚ÄúProud of our club. We will come again.‚Äù Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital subscription to Yorkshire Post, you can get access to all of our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. His words are accompanied by a picture of Leeds fans at Wembley , scarves aloft, in the final few minutes before kick-off under the arch. Another summer of change appears to be ahead for Leeds, who must now prepare for another season in the second tier. Cooper is out of contract and as it stands, will be seeking pastures new as a free agent. There will also inevitably be clubs circling for some of Leeds‚Äô most valuable assets. Crysencio Summerville, the 2023/24 Championship Player of the Season , is among those to have already been linked with a move away from Elland Road. Leeds boss Daniel Farke was reluctant to talk about changes to the squad in the immediate aftermath of the Wembley defeat, although a reshaping appears to be on the cards.",

        "content": "Astronomers have characterised a number of extreme worlds in a new catalogue, including sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns and super-Earths. Such discoveries are expected to get increasingly common as exoplanetary science moves from one of discovery to one of characterization. Multiple papers have been published based on the catalogue. New Delhi: After three years of research, scientists have assembled the largest single catalogue so far characterising exoplanets. Such large catalogues are expected to get increasingly common in the future. The catalogue contains 120 confirmed exoplanets, and six exoplanet candidates that require follow-up observations to be confirmed. Contained in the catalogue are many weird and wonderful worlds, including a super-dense planet designated as TOI-1824 b . A paper describing the catalogue has been published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement . Supplementary papers on individual systems include TOI-1347 b that possibly has an atmosphere, TOI-1386 a system with a transiting sub-Saturn as well as a non-transiting exoplanet with a mass comparable to Saturn, a sub-Neptune in orbit around TOI-1437 , a sub-Neptune with the designation of TOI-1751 b in orbit around a primordial, metal-poor star, and the super-dense sub-Neptune TOI-1824 b mentioned above. TOI-1386 The TOI-1386 system has a pair of known exoplanets orbiting a star that is similar to the Sun. The first of these is a sub-Saturn, a planet that straddles the size gap between Neptune and Saturn. TOI-1386 b is the first planet discovered in the size range, and scientists did not previously know that such worlds even existed. TOI-1386 b orbits the host star in 26 Earth days, while its companion, a planet of similar mass to Saturn takes 227 days to orbit the host star. One of the study authors, Michelle Hill says , ‚ÄúThere is ongoing debate about whether sub-Saturn planets are truly rare, or if we are just bad at finding planets like these. So, this planet, TOI-1386 b, is an important addition to this demographic of planets.‚Äù TOI-1437 b TOI-1437 b is also in orbit around a star similar to the Sun, with each year lasting 19 Earth days. This is a sub-Neptune, a world larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. One of the study authors, Daria Pidhorodetska says , ‚ÄúPlanets smaller than Neptune but larger than Earth are the most prevalent worlds in our galaxy, yet they are absent from our own Solar System. Each time a new one is discovered, we are reminded of how diverse our Universe is, and that our existence in the cosmos may be more unique than we can understand.‚Äù What is interesting about this system is that the host star is of a similar mass, age and size as the Sun, allowing for an apples-to-apples comparison. This system enables an apt comparison between the Solar System and other star systems. The catalogue contains exotic exoplanets that are in even tighter orbits around their host stars. TOI-1798 c TOI-1798 c is in orbit around an orange dwarf star. The exoplanet is a sub-Neptune with an orbit of around 12 hours, or half a day. This is one of the few systems known with an inner planet that has an ultra-short period orbit. Lead author of the catalogue paper, Alex Polanski says , ‚ÄúWhile the majority of planets we know about today orbit their star faster than Mercury orbits the Sun, USPs take this to the extreme. TOI-1798 c orbits its star so quickly that one year on this planet lasts less than half a day on Earth.‚Äù The exoplanet is in such a close orbit around the host star that it receives 3000 times more radiation than the Earth receives from the Sun. The intense stellar radiation would have stripped away any atmosphere on the planet. The proximity of the host star also suggests that the exoplanet is tidally locked, with a day side always oriented towards the Sun, and a night side in perpetual darkness.",

Ohio Real estate investor Larry Connor said he is preparing to plunge more than 12,400 feet to the site in a two-person Triton submersible, with the company's co-founder and CEO Patrick Lahey. Connor said he wants \"to show people worldwide that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way.\" He explained the ¬£15.7 million ($20 million) vessel Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer they plan to use, which was designed by Lahey, is capable of carrying out multiple trips to the ocean's treacherous depths. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Connor told the Wall Street Journal : \"Patrick has been thinking about and designing this for over a decade.

The doomed sub had been heading to the same site when the tragedy occurred on June 18. But Connor called Lahey a few days later urging him to construct a better sub. Lahey told the outlet: \"[He said], you know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.\" Connor hasn't yet revealed when their expedition will take place.

Rush died when the vessel was crushed under the pressure alongside British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; his son Suleman, 19; British businessman Hamish Harding, 58; and Paul-Henry Nargeolet, 77, a former French navy diver. David Mearns, a rescue expert who knew two of the five men on board, told Sky News at the time: \"The only saving grace is that it would have been immediate - literally in milliseconds. \"The men wouldn't have known what was happening.\" SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "description": "A total of 97,386 voters have registered to exercise their right to vote in advance on June 2, a source from the Ministry of Internal Administration (MAI) told Lusa agency.",
        "content": "According to MAI, early mobility voting, on Sunday, June 2nd, is allowed to all registered voters in the national territory, at a polling station of their choice and registration can be done until Thursday, the 30th. Portugal recorded, in the 2019 European elections, the worst abstention rate (68.6%) since belonging to the European Union, in contrast to participation in Europe - around 50%. To try to reverse this trend - in addition to the early voting of sick people, prisoners, and those abroad, or the mobility vote, on the previous Sunday (June 2nd) - this year there is a new modality, only possible because there are \"dematerialised electoral registers\". Any registered voter in Portugal can vote \"other than in the place where they are registered\", the spokesperson for the National Elections Commission ( CNE ), Fernando AnastaÃÅcio, explained to Lusa on the 25th. \"You can choose without any pre-registration conditions, for example, you live in Lisbon, you are registered in Lisbon, but on the 9th you are in Porto, you can choose to go to any polling station in Porto: present yourself at the vote, identify yourself with your citizen card or a document that is considered valid for identification purposes and exercise your right to vote\", he said. The elections were scheduled at the European level for the period from June 6th to 9th. And this is, according to the CNE spokesperson, \"a particularly difficult period for Portugal\", as it coincides with \"a week that is usually a mini-holiday period. Around 373 million European voters are called to vote for the European Parliament between June 6th and 9th. In Portugal, voting is on the 9th. 720 MEPs will be chosen, 21 of which are Portuguese.",

Three days after Lai was sworn into office, warships and fighter jets encircled Taiwan in drills China said were a test of its ability to seize the island it claims as part of its territory. Lai vowed in his inaugural speech to defend Taiwan's democracy and freedom, which Beijing said amounted to a \"confession of independence\". Speaking during a visit to an air force base in eastern Hualien on Tuesday, Lai toasted the troops for their hard work \"in response to China's military exercises\" -- his first direct reference to the war games on Thursday and Friday. \"Let's work together and continue to work hard to make our country safer,\" he said. \"Everyone is on standby 24 hours a day to perform air patrol missions... All brothers and sisters use their firm determination and outstanding combat skills to demonstrate their air combat capabilities and protect our airspace,\" he added. Lai also visited an army base where he watched artillerymen demonstrate loading and discharging a howitzer. He gave the soldiers a \"red envelope\" -- a tradition during holidays -- as a token of appreciation and took group photos with the troops. The Hualien air force base saw dozens of fighter jets take off on Friday, the second day of China's military drills. China has upped military and political pressures on Taiwan in recent years, and its naval vessels, drones and warplanes maintain a near-daily presence around the island. On Tuesday, Taiwan's defence ministry said three Chinese warplanes, and 11 naval and coastguard ships were detected in the past 24 hours -- down from the 21 aircraft and 15 ships it reported on Monday. Experts say these are \"grey zone tactics\", which stop short of outright acts of war but serve to exhaust Taipei's military.

MANILA, Philippines ‚ÄîFrom holding the game in small university gyms to hosting a Finals series with an average of more than 20,000 spectators, the Premier Volleyball League‚Äìand, in turn, the sport of volleyball‚Äìhas come a long way in the Philippines. This was what longtime organizer Sports Vision had envisioned since it founded the Shakey‚Äôs V-League‚Äìwhere PVL traces its roots that started primarily as a collegiate preseason league‚Äìin 2004, and seeing drones of fans come to the PVL games now has left president Ricky Palou in awe of how volleyball in the country has evolved. ‚ÄúI remember if there were at leastm50 people watching, we‚Äôd already be so happy,‚Äù Palou told Inquirer following the success of the 2024 season‚Äôs first conference‚Äìwhich drew record-breaking numbers in live spectators during the PVL Finals. READ: Looking back at PVL‚Äôs ‚Äòvery successful‚Äô 2023 ‚ÄúWe started in 2004. There were few fans, but we noticed that slowly the number of spectators increased. Now we‚Äôre reaching 20,000 to 24,000. We‚Äôre happy about this.‚Äù Numbers, as they say, don‚Äôt lie and these record-setting crowd counts in the PVL can only be considered a testament to the continued rise of volleyball in the country. This photo of Philippine Army Lady Troopers celebrating the of the 2011 Shakey‚Äôs V-League Open Conference shows the beginnings of club volleyball competition in the Philippines. ‚ÄìAUGUST DELA CRUZ It all started when Sports Vision Management Group ventured into the volleyball scene with the Shakey‚Äôs V-League, which featured college teams playing at Lyceum, Blue Eagle Gym, and Rizal Memorial Coliseum in the mid-2000s. Eventually, club teams and military squads joined to form the Open Conference before the league was rebranded as the PVL in 2017. The league continued to grow with current clubs Creamline, the most successful with eight titles, Petro Gazz, and Choco Mucho with games now being regularly played FilOil EcoOil Centre in San Juan, Philsports Arena, and Mall of Asia Arena. READ: ‚ÄòRight time‚Äô to turn pro for PVL; players excited The PVL decided to turn professional in 2020, making it the first volleyball league in the country with pro status, and drew defunct Philippine Superliga teams like Cignal, PLDT, and Chery Tiggo. The first-ever pro tournament inside the bubble in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte was ruled by the Crossovers, led by sisters Jaja and Dindin Santiago-Manabat, after beating the Cool Smashers behind closed doors at PCV Socio-Civic and Cultural Center. When the COVID-19 restrictions were slowly lifted, the PVL returned in 2022 with a semi-bubble setup at Paco Arena until it received a go signal to open its doors to the fans at FilOil and MOA Arena, thus signaling the rise of Philippine volleyball. Teams have come and go since then, but the PVL eventually managed to put up a 12-team field with Akari, Nxled, Farm Fresh, Strong Group Athletics, Capital1, and Galeries Tower joining the fray. A general view of the record PVL crowd during Game 2 of the Finals between Creamline and Choco Mucho at Araneta Coliseum. ‚ÄìPVL PHOTO The PVL shattered the Philippine volleyball attendance record after 24,459 fans watched Creamline‚Äôs title-clinching Game 2 win over Choco Mucho at the Big Dome last December in the second All-Filipino Conference, surpassing the previous high of 22,848 spectators between Ateneo and La Salle in the 2016 UAAP finals at the same venue. Creamline and Choco Mucho, two of the PVL‚Äôs most popular teams, met again for the second straight All-Filipino Finals and it was no surprise that the last game of the series came just over a 1,000 spectators short of the record with a 23,162 crowd count at Araneta Coliseum. READ: Just like the All-Filipino title, PVL attendance record stays put Seeing packed crowds even on a weekday, though, have become a common sight for the PVL, especially during the playoffs, with the championship opener drawing 17,457 supporters on a Thursday evening also at the Big Dome. On the final day of the semis last May 5, Close to 18,000 fans attended the game day when Creamline beat Chery Tiggo to return to the finals and Choco Mucho completed a three-game sweep after eliminating Petro Gazz. This was despite PVL‚Äôs simultaneous schedule with the PBA and the Final Four game between UST and La Salle in the UAAP Season 86 women‚Äôs volleyball tournament where 19,505 spectators came to see the Tigresses dethrone the Lady Spikers to end a five-year Finals drought. PVL‚Äôs final semis game started at 7:03 p.m. and ended at 9:11 p.m. whie the UST-La Salle match was played from 6:09 p.m. to 9:01 p.m. Palou and the organizers are honored to receive such a huge following from Filipino sports fans, who have been taking the PVL to greater heights as one of the main sports in the country. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre amazed at how the fans have come to like volleyball and appreciate the game of volleyball. I guess they find it exciting so we‚Äôre very happy and elated that the number of volleyball fans is increasing,‚Äù said the Sports Vision president. Celebrities like Vice Ganda and Willie Revillame, PBA players, other Filipino athletes, and other personalities have been part of PVL‚Äôs enthusiasm over the past two years. A game between the PVL‚Äôs biggest crowd draws‚ÄìChoco Mucho Flying Titans and Creamline Cool Smashers‚Äìin the PVL All-Filipino Conference Finals. ‚ÄìMARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.nbet More than the skills and charisma of the league‚Äôs fan favorites like Alyssa Valdez, Jema Galanza, Deanna Wong, Sisi Rondina, Mika Reyes, Eya Laure, and other stars, Palou believes the formula for the PVL‚Äôs continuous rise is the excitement and intensity of the games and the parity of the competition. ‚ÄúFans what to see good games between teams and everything is fair and transparent, that‚Äôs the formula there, ‚Äù Palou said. ‚ÄúThey come to watch because they enjoy the games.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the last championship game, I was sitting beside a lady I asked: ‚ÄòWho are you rooting for her, Choco Mucho or Creamline?‚Äô She said, ‚Äò‚ÄôSir, I‚Äôm cheering for Creamline.‚Äô But when Choco Mucho scores, she would still cheer,‚Äù he added. READ: PVL: Creamline, Choco Mucho grateful for overwhelming support from fans ‚ÄúSo I said, ‚ÄòI thought you were cheering from Creamline?‚Äô She said: ‚ÄòSir as long as the plays and hits are good, we‚Äôre also excited.‚Äô It‚Äôs exciting. They like a good match.‚Äù But as the league grows, so do the expectations to keep the level of competition high and the audience engaged‚Äìwhich is what the PVL is looking to address as soon as possible. A good place to start would be a Rookie Draft. ‚ÄúWe just wanted to make sure that everything would be fair. Because we‚Äôre transparent, we don‚Äôt really want one team to dominate, we‚Äôd like all to be competitive and everybody will have a chance to win a championship. What we‚Äôre really looking at really is the fair officiating and everything,‚Äù Palou said. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôd like to see is the other clubs make their teams more competitive so that all games can attract a good number of spectators. Now what you see is if they know the game will be on sided, fans tend now to attend. What we really want is all teams will be very competitive.‚Äù READ: PVL looks to address player tampering to preserve league harmony In the first rookie Draft set for July 6, the college stars and other aspirants are expected to boost the rosters of the bottom four, Strong Group Athletics, Capital1, Galeries Tower, and Farm Fresh. The move was borne out of recent developments in the PVL when the more established teams pulled off off recruitment sprees and signed young collegiate stars who were still far from using up their eligibilities in the collegiate leagues. Packed crowds for both the PVL and UAAP volleyball games has PNVF saying that volleyball is now the Philippines‚Äô top sport. At the rate that the fanbases of the teams in the PVL are growing and how venues are filled for the games also in the UAAP volleyball tournaments, Philippine National Volleyball Federation president Tats Suzara claimed that volleyball has already surpassed basketball as the country‚Äôs top sport. ‚ÄúVolleyball is now the number one sport among spectators in the Philippines, not basketball. I said this to boss MVP (Manny V. Pangilinan), and he said, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs a lot, 46 thousands [fans] in one day?'‚Äù said Suzara. ‚ÄúSo I told him, volleyball is a family entertainment sport All ages, families, boyfriends-girlfriends, father and mother. So I think, it‚Äôs a sport that‚Äôs really made for families,‚Äù said Suzara. ‚ÄúIf you will see the difference, in my experience, the basketball ‚Äî Fiba World Cup was more on the players‚Äô experience. But for volleyball, it‚Äôs the fan experience. Players cooperate with the fans, they welcome interviews. So I think it makes volleyball now the number one sport in the world and the Philippines, of course,‚Äù he added. And the Philippines‚Äô latest success in the AVC Challenge Cup, where the newly-named Alas Pilipinas women‚Äôs squad has made history, has only added to the interest of the nation in volleyball. The tightly knit Alas Pilipinas celebrates a four-set win over Iran in the AVC Challenge Cup 2024 Saturday night. ‚ÄîMARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.net Despite limited preparation, Alas Pilipinas swept four games in Pool A to reach the semifinals ‚Äî the farthest a Philippine team reached since joining the tournaments of the Asian Confederation in 1961. The young Alas Pilipinas, led by captain Jia De Guzman and go-to scorer Angel Canino, won their games in front of electric 5,000 fans at Rizal Memorial Coliseum every night despite the rainy weather in their last two games. The tickets for the Philippines‚Äô semifinal game against Kazakhstan on Tuesday were sold out as the Filipino Spikers hope to make a historic entry to the Final. READ: For just P15,000 each to play, Alas Pilipinas earns fans‚Äô hearts This is exactly how Palou thinks volleyball can solidify itself as the Philippines‚Äô no. 1 sport‚Äìthrough excellence in international tournaments‚Äìand the country may have just taken the first step towards that. ‚ÄúIf we do relatively well in the international scene, if we can be competitive in AVC tournaments we think it will improve the following of volleyball. Our target is for the national team to do well in the next Southeast Asian Games, which is next year,‚Äù Palou said. The last time the women‚Äôs squad won a Southeast Asian Games medal was in 2005, while the men‚Äôs players earned a historic silver medal in the 2019 edition.

        "content": "Marjorie, 102, and Bernie, 100, tied the knot after nearly a decade (Picture: Sarah Sicherman) Centenarian couple Marjorie Fiterman,102, and Bernie Littman, 100, married each other on May 19, after meeting in their care home nearly a decade ago. The couple, who have a combined age of 202 years, may have broken a Guinness World Record. The previous record holders, according to Fox News, belonged to Doreen and George Kirby of England, who had a combined age of 194 years when they wed on June 13, 2015. The Philadelphia newlyweds have proved it‚Äôs never too late to tie the knot, and their families are very happy for them. Bernie‚Äôs granddaughter, Sarah Sicherman, told Fox News it was great that he had found a companion ‚Äòto do activities and spend time with‚Äô. She said they were ‚Äòso lucky to have found each other‚Äô and that they supported each other well throughout the pandemic. Marjorie and Bernie getting married on May 19 (Picture: Sarah Sicherman facebook) Writing on Facebook, Sarah said: ‚ÄòNext week my 100-year-old grandfather is marrying his 102-year-old girlfriend! ‚ÄòThis unique celebration, marking a century of memories and more, promises to be an unforgettable day filled with love, laughter, and a testament to timeless affection. Mazal tov!‚Äô Bernie had previously been married to Bernice for 65 years, who passed away in 2012. A few years later he then met Marjorie at a costume party and the pair ended up having their first date on the same day his great-granddaughter was born. His family said his plans to marry Marjorie had been a ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô as they ‚Äòassumed they would just live out their days status quo‚Äô. Marjorie and Bernie met in their care home nearly a decade ago (Picture: Sarah Sicherman facebook) The Rabbi, Adam Wohlberg, who married the couple, said to Fox News, the pair got to the point ‚Äòwhere being not just close friends ‚Äì but husband and wife ‚Äì felt like the right step to take‚Äô. He didn‚Äôt give them any marriage advice at the ceremony because they already had a wealth of experience in that department. The Rabbi said: ‚ÄòI think it is safe to say each of you, what you know and understand about each other, is exactly what the future holds for you and your partner. And what you have determined you love about each other ‚Äì well, those things are not about to change.‚Äô Marjorie had been married to her husband Morris before he passed away in 1999, but knew ‚Äòsomeone incredibly special had come into [her] life‚Äô when she met Bernie. Read More Stories There‚Äôs a chance the newlyweds crossed paths decades earlier when they were both students at the University of Pennsylvania, studying at the same time. Marjorie and Bernie went to the same university ‚Äì the University of Pennsylvania ‚Äì but never knew each other (Picture: Sarah Sicherman facebook) With different degrees in different departments, they didn‚Äôt know of each other when they were there though. Their Rabbi joked the pair may make the cover of the university‚Äôs alumni magazine when the next edition comes out. Bernie‚Äôs daughter Sarah also commented on the couple‚Äôs Guinness World Record application, saying it was ‚Äòpending,‚Äô but that she and her family believe the newlyweds are the ‚ÄòOldest Aggregate Age Couple to Marry, by about eight years‚Äô.

        "content": "The South Korean government is ramping up discussions on specific tax incentives aimed at enhancing the market value of local companies, with plans to conduct public hearings over the next two months. ‚ÄúWe talked about tax incentives for the Value-up Program on several occasions. But now is the time for us to discuss more specific plans,‚Äù Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok told reporters on Monday. ‚ÄúThroughout June and July, we will host public hearings to deliberate specific tax incentives,‚Äù Choi said. The government‚Äôs Corporate Value-up Program aims to incentivize listed firms to bolster their value, thereby improving their market value and addressing the so-called ‚ÄúKorea discount‚Äù issue. ‚ÄúKorea discount‚Äù refers to Korean companies being seen as comparatively undervalued due to various factors. However, the recent release of a vague guideline lacking binding force and specific incentives to boost participation has drawn criticism. READ: South Korea proposes tax cuts to stimulate corporate investment Choi mentioned that the hearings will cover various incentives discussed in the market, including separate taxation of dividend income, corporate tax credits for increased dividends, and the abolition of inheritance tax surcharges for major shareholders. ‚ÄúFrom the perspective of the effectiveness of incentives, the more benefits, the better. However, an excess could compromise fairness. We‚Äôll strive to strike a balance,‚Äù he emphasized. The top finance policymaker revealed that the open hearings will occur two to three times over the next two months. In the initial session, options will be refined, with subsequent discussions aimed at finalizing incentive details. Choi also noted that discussions on inheritance tax will be included in the hearings. South Korea has the world‚Äôs second-highest inheritance tax rate at 50 percent, with a 20 percent ‚Äúmanagement premium‚Äù surcharge for major stakeholders at large firms, elevating the rate to the world‚Äôs highest, at 60 percent. ‚ÄúIn regard to the inheritance tax law, there are various proposals, from eliminating the surcharge for major shareholders to expanding family business inheritance deductions and enhancing benefits for Value-up companies,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWe will narrow down options through public hearings and incorporate them into the tax law amendment.‚Äù READ: S. Korea readies financial support for small businesses, builders Monday‚Äôs briefing marked Choi‚Äôs inaugural monthly press conference, a move aimed at enhancing communication with the media and the public. During the session, he addressed various queries, including clarifying the government‚Äôs position on the short-selling ban. ‚ÄúTo reintroduce short selling, we need regulatory enhancements to combat illegal practices, including the implementation of a monitoring system,‚Äù he emphasized. ‚ÄúWith the ban set to continue until June, we aim to clarify our resumption plans by the end of the month for market stability. Earlier that day, Financial Supervisory Service Governor Lee Bok-hyun suggested that the short-selling monitoring system‚Äôs development could conclude in the first quarter of next year, suggesting a potential lift of the ban around that time. Choi also disclosed the government‚Äôs plans to support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises by extending the period for receiving benefits from three years to five years. Additional measures to assist them post-extension will also be introduced. These measures will be unveiled in early June as part of the government‚Äôs ‚Äúdynamic economy road map,‚Äù outlining its economic policy vision. Regarding inflation, Choi reiterated the government‚Äôs positive outlook. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "description": "A chemist has spoken out about online packing tips which could cause your holiday to be delayed",
        "content": "Holidaymakers could end up seriously delayed at the airport or missing their flight if they follow a medication packing trend that‚Äôs gone viral on social media, chemists have warned. The hack sees people remove medication from its original packaging and put it in sweet boxes - such as TicTac containers - to save space in luggage, but Mitesh Desai, director at Landys Chemist, has spoken out about the hack videos. Although it may seem like a handy way to save on space, passengers could end up in difficulty at airport security if the medication is not in its original packaging, BristolLive reports . Mitesh said: ‚ÄúWhile swapping your medicine packaging for a smaller container that might take up slightly less space in your luggage, seems like a good idea, there are a few reasons why this isn‚Äôt recommended. ‚ÄúRemoving medication from its original packaging can cause delays at the airport. The lack of identification could raise concerns, with security requiring additional information, delaying or potentially preventing you from boarding your flight. In worst-case scenarios, you may have to discard your medicine. READ MORE: Jet2 and EasyJet warn of 'delays and disruption' this half term \"In addition to the hassle of making it through the airport, you could also run the risk of diminishing the effectiveness of your medication by putting it into a different container. Medical packaging is designed to protect medication from interacting with elements such as light, heat, moisture and air, which can degrade the potency of medicine over time. \"When you remove your medication‚Äôs original packaging, exposure to external elements can reduce the stability of the medication‚Äôs formulation and contribute to a potential loss of therapeutic benefits.‚Äù Mitesh added: ‚ÄúMedical packaging often incorporates child-resistant features such as anti-twist child locks to prevent accidental ingestion by curious young children who may mistake medicine for a sweet treat. When you remove medicine from its child-resistant packaging, you increase the risk of accidental poisoning or the ingestion of harmful substances by children. This could have fatal consequences.‚Äù The leading chemist said: ‚ÄúSocial media algorithms often show users content that aligns with their existing beliefs and preferences, leading to confirmation bias. If someone already holds certain misconceptions about health and sees them reinforced on social media, they may become more resistant to seeking evidence-based medical advice. \"Medical advice from qualified professionals is tailored to every individual's specific health condition, medical history and other relevant factors. Advice from people who aren‚Äôt qualified to give it can do more harm than good because such advice, as well-intentioned as it may be, may not take individual differences into account and can be inappropriate or ineffective to a wider audience.‚Äù Mitesh said different countries will have different rules around medication, adding: ‚ÄúDifferent countries have different rules and regulations about the kind of medication you can or cannot carry with you. Many countries will require you to keep your medication in its original packaging when travelling overseas, ensuring that the label is clear and legible. Medications that are freely available in one country may be classed as controlled substances in other countries. The best way to know what medicines you can or cannot carry abroad is by checking with the embassy of the country you‚Äôre travelling to, who can advise on whether or not you will need to carry your prescription or a personal license and so on.‚Äù For more of today's top stories, click here.",

        "content": ", business development manager for federal and artificial intelligence at (NYSE: DELL), said government agencies that intend to implement AI at the edge should consider adopting to quickly glean insights from data while ensuring the security of critical data. In an article published on , Hicks noted that federated learning could enable agencies to leverage larger datasets at a decreased bandwidth. ‚ÄúFederated models require significantly less bandwidth than other models because the information isn‚Äôt being sent back to a data center for processing,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIf an agency has a rich dataset in the cloud and a small amount of compute at the edge, it can use federated learning to train the edge device without having to move all the data from the cloud.‚Äù Hicks cited some of the key considerations for agencies that plan to apply AI at the edge, including the need to identify the end goal of the AI or a machine learning model. ‚ÄúOther key questions include how much data an agency is trying to process and how quickly it needs the results,‚Äù he added. The Dell Technologies executive discussed how the company works to help agencies that intend to incorporate AI at the edge, such as creating a roadmap for AI implementation, providing federated learning and analytics tools to agencies and finding ways for agencies to make the most of their data. ‚ÄúWe also provided a validated, containerized solution that agencies can use to quickly and easily deploy a federated learning solution in a Kubernetes environment,‚Äù Hicks added.

        "content": "The Florida Panthers promised tonight would be one of those fasten-your-seatbelt playoff games when they look to level their Eastern Conference final series at two games apiece. If the Rangers win they‚Äôll be up 3-1 and in the driver‚Äôs seat heading back to Madison Square Garden. And in Edmonton, the Oilers will have a day to figure out how they blew a tire after a fast start against the Stars last night, before trying to tie their West final series at 2-2 tomorrow. Here are five things to know about the NHL playoffs: COMEBACK OR COLLAPSE? Great comeback or a big collapse? That was the question after Edmonton blew a 2-0 lead and lost 5-3 to the visiting Dallas Stars last night. Oilers captain Connor McDavid, who had a goal and assist in the first period at Rogers Place, figured it may have been a bit of both. ‚ÄúThey went up a couple levels and we went down a few levels,‚Äù McDavid said. ‚ÄúYou see the difference.‚Äù The Oilers outshot the Stars 10-3 in the first, outscored, outhit, outhustled and outskated the visitors and led 2-0. Then, the Oilers took their foot off the gas and the Stars, led by Jason Robertson, dominated the second period, outshooting the Oilers 16-7, outscoring them 3-1 and outhustling them for loose pucks. The Oilers have seen this movie before. They blew a late 4-2 lead in Game 1 against the Vancouver Canucks and lost 5-4. The Oilers led Game 7 against the Canucks 3-0 and then desperately scrambled to hang on for a series-clinching 3-2 win. McDavid and defenceman Darnell Nurse said 50-minute efforts don‚Äôt cut it in the post-season. Both promised to be better in Game 4. REPLACEMENTS PLAY BIG ROLE The Replacements, a 2000 sports comedy starring Canadian Keanu Reaves, poked fun at missing players during the 1987 NFL strike. The Replacements 2.0, a true 2024 sports ‚Äúdrama‚Äù starring the Oilers‚Äô Adam Henrique and the Stars‚Äô Roope Hintz, is a real story about the value of injecting skilled players back into the Edmonton-Dallas NHL playoff series. Hintz, who played his first game last night since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second-round series against the Colorado Avalanche, assisted on both Jason Robertson goals in the second period. Henrique, who injured his ankle in Game 5 of the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, scored the Oilers‚Äô third goal in the second period which tied the game 3-3 heading into the intermission. SEGUIN MARKS MILESTONE WITH KEY ASSISTS Tyler Seguin played his 130th playoff game last night and the Stars‚Äô forward did more than just show up. The 32-year-old Seguin, of Brampton, Ont., assisted on Robertson‚Äôs first goal in the second period and then set up Robertson‚Äôs winning goal in the third period. TROUBA HIT WITH ELBOWING FINE New York Rangers‚Äô defenceman and captain Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 yesterday for Sunday‚Äôs second-period elbowing infraction that levelled Evan Rodrigues of the Florida Panthers. Trouba, now the No. 1 villain in Florida, makes $8 million a year, so the fine is easier to take than a suspension. In fact, Panthers‚Äô bench boss Paul Maurice ‚Äî who coached Trouba in Winnipeg ‚Äî mocked the paltry fine, suggesting reporters pass the hat around so Jake will be able to eat after making the payment. Trouba said the controversial hit ‚Äújust happened fast‚Äù and insisted he wasn‚Äôt targeting Rodrigues‚Äô head. In fact, one New York beat reporter asked the hard-nosed defenceman if the Panthers are guilty of embellishment. Expect the hitting to get cranked up another notch on Tuesday when the host Panthers aim to level the best-of-seven Eastern Conference final at two games apiece. COMEBACK RANGERS IN RECORD BOOKS The Rangers established an NHL record for most comeback victories in the regular season and playoffs combined as they earned their 34th of 2023-24 with Sunday‚Äôs 5-4 overtime victory in Florida. The Blueshirts also matched their franchise record for most overtime wins in a post-season with four. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 28, 2024.",

Get the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest entertainment news sent straight to your inbox with our weekly Showbiz newsletter We have more newsletters Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are expected to introduce their children, five year old Prince Archie and two year old Princess Lilibet, to the world in a grand manner but they're waiting for the right moment, according to a royal expert. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have largely kept their two young kids away from the public eye but following their recent tour in Nigeria, some royal enthusiasts were hopeful that the couple would include their children in future overseas trips. Royal author Tom Quinn suggests that this is precisely what \"proud\" parents Harry and Meghan plan to do when the time is right. Quinn believes that Meghan recognises the positive impact that Archie and Lilibet's public appearances could have on the Sussex brand, the Express reports. Speaking to the Mirror, he said: \"Harry and Meghan are incredibly proud of their children, and when they are a little older and better able to travel, there is no doubt they will be taken on some of the couple's tours. \"Meghan is acutely aware of what a great look this will be, the charming royal couple with their charming royal children will attract the sort of publicity that Harry and Meghan crave, especially now that they are so determined to be billionaire entrepreneurs.\" However, the expert also noted that such a move could affect the Royal Family. As the Montecito-based couple continue to lead increasingly prominent royal lives, Kate and William may find themselves struggling to keep up.

Harry and Meghan have recently returned from a three-day visit to West Africa, where they focused on mental health support for soldiers and youth empowerment as part of the Invictus Games' 10th-anniversary celebrations. The journey has been hailed as a triumph by numerous royal commentators, with some even referring to it as an \"unofficial royal tour\". During their stay, the couple also hinted at future engagements similar to their Nigerian trip. Speaking to PEOPLE, Harry emphasised the importance of in-person engagement: \"It is hugely important for us to meet directly with people, supporting our causes and listening, in order to bring about solutions, support and positive change.\" He further discussed their upcoming plans, stating: \"There's only so much one can do from home and over Zoom, so we look forward to travelling more because the work matters.\" Harry also mentioned the broader scope of their initiatives: \"Whether it's the Archewell Foundation, Invictus or any of our other causes, there will always be reasons to meet the people at the heart of our work.\" Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.
