        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "description": "Change means that any body of water that meets the state definition of 'public water' will be granted legal protection, even if it isn't on the decades-old state inventory",
        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. ADVERTISEMENT The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” ADVERTISEMENT He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

The exact recovery period for the 33-year-old has not yet been disclosed, but the player himself has confirmed that the Euros will come too soon. “I can’t imagine I’ve had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs.

In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff but it turns out I can’t play the Euros,” De Roon wrote in an post on “I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it’s a very tough day.

        "content": "Controversial musician, Habeeb Okikiola, popularly known as Portable, has declared himself police ambassador a few days after causing a stir while evading arrest by police officers. Portable made this known in a post on his Instagram page, where he shared photos of himself with his father and other high-ranking officers in the Lagos police headquarters on Tuesday evening. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers at police headquarters in Lagos State. The Zazoo crooner regained his freedom the following day after being arrested for incurring a debt on the Mercedes Benz GLE he bought from a car dealer in Lagos. The singer further went to his social media page to explain what transpired between him and the car dealer, alleging that he had spent more than required on the vehicle because it was faulty. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers are at police headquarters in Lagos State. Meanwhile, reaffirming his relationship with the police, he announced that he is now a police ambassador while adopting the oft-used phrase – ‘Police is your friend’. He wrote, “ZAzuu Federal Government liability. Ọmọ ijoba Police Ambassador. I do music for a living ....Star don’t beg to shine. Akoi Grace Wey No Dey disgrace. Portable, his father, and other high-ranking police officers are at police headquarters in Lagos State. “I no fit run from God that’s all my believing God is over everything after God na government Police is our friends I believe in God my phone and sub any disappointment is a blessing.

No one does it better.” Recall that after spending 24 hours in custody, the “Zazuu” crooner shared a snippet of his new song – “Spiderman” in response to his arrest for defaulting on the payment plan for his car. Produced by 2tuponthebeat, the song alludes to the singer’s flying power, referencing how he jumped over a gate to evade arrest. Portable The incident was captured in a video that circulated on Tuesday. The singer, dressed in a white and black stripe shirt, stood alongside eight other people and was seen climbing over a nearby gate before taking to his heels.",

        "content": "CARDIFF: England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler is likely to miss the third T20I of the four-match series against Pakistan, an international media outlet reported. According to the report, Buttler left for London after spearheading England to a comfortable 23-run victory over Pakistan in the second T20I in Birmingham. The England captain and his wife Louise are expecting the birth of their third child soon. Notably, Jos Buttler was absent from England’s training session in Cardiff on Monday afternoon and is unlikely to feature in the third T20I against Pakistan, scheduled on Tuesday evening. Moreover, it is uncertain whether Buttler will return in time for the final T20I against Pakistan but as things stand he is most likely to accompany the England squad on their departure for the West Indies for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 on Friday. Earlier, England’s vice-captain Moeen Ali, who has led the side in 12 ODIs and T20Is, stated that nothing will change if he assumes the England captaincy role in Jos Buttler’s absence. “I feel I’ve captained enough for England,” Moeen said. “I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much, it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. “For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. It’s not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team and all that. We’re on the same page anyway.” Pakistan squad: Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan.

The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:22 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Edmonton Oilers' Adam Henrique (19) celebrates a goal against the Arizona Coyotes during NHL action in Edmonton on Friday April 12, 2024. The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world.

        "content": "TALAMBAH: A shocking incident was reported from Tulamba area of Punjab where two orphan sisters were violently assaulted and had their fingers burned for allegedly stealing books from the madrasa, ARY News reported on Monday. The mother of the victim girls claimed accused that the individuals, named Mudassir and Maqsood along with others tortured her daughters, adding that the girls were taken to a tent, tied with ropes, and hung. She claims that the assailants later handed both her and the girls over to the police. “The police released me and my daughters on the guarantee of non-medical examination,” the mother claimed. The mother has accused the authorities of neglect and insists that a medical examination and justice for her daughters are necessary. She also stated that the girls have been barred from receiving any medical or psychological support following the trauma. DSP Saleem Rath confirmed that the girls were accused of stealing books from a madarssa and passing them to someone else. He mentioned that the incident occurred a few days ago and assured that he is currently investigating the case. DSP Rath promised a transparent inquiry, emphasizing that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDiscover how the three bargain stocks operating in oil and gas transportation and financial sectors can turbocharge the portfolio's growth.The post 3 Bargain Stocks Ready to Supercharge Your Wealth appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "One should look for hidden jewels in the stock market, which provide stability and development possibilities. Three businesses have stood out in this endeavor; each represents a different industry — banking, insurance and energy. They are all united by opportunity and perseverance. The first one excels in the energy field, namely in gas and oil transportation. Growing Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates indicate that geopolitical concerns and an aging tanker fleet have driven the company’s market performance. Meanwhile, the second one deftly negotiates the complex world of insurance. The company has maintained policyholders in the face of substantial premium hikes and enhanced the performance of its Property & Casualty (P&C) sector by implementing a methodical plan for profitability restoration. Finally, with strong financial indicators, the third one commands respect in regional banking. Strategic balance sheet expansion is the foundation for its strong performance, as seen by its earnings per share ( EPS ), return on equity and net interest income. Overall, these businesses offer more than just financial prospects. They are examples of resilience against volatile markets. Frontline (FRO) Frontline (NYSE: FRO ) has already secured 72% of Suezmax days at $52,800 per day, 69% of Aframax (LR2) days at an exceptional $67,800 per day, and 81% of Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) days at an average TCE cost of $55,100 per day for the first quarter of 2024 (in Q4 2023). These rising rates are load-to-discharge-based and the number of ballast days may impact them. Moreover, the tanker business is significantly affected ton-mile by the heightened tensions in the Middle East and the interruptions in the Red Sea/Aden area . Additionally, the United States is putting more pressure on Russia’s price cap evasions and the so-called Dark Fleet. Due to economies of scale, bigger boats such as VLCCs are preferred in the expanding trading lanes as non-OPEC oil output rises, especially from the U.S. and Brazil. Finally, with 133 VLCCs scheduled to reach 20 years old in 2024 alone, a sizable portion of the fleet’s current age is nearing or beyond 20. The Suezmax fleet has a comparable pattern. Thus, the aging fleet and rising ordering activity indicate a probable decrease in available tonnage, which might compress supply and justify higher prices. Horace Mann (HMN) Horace Mann ‘s (NYSE: HMN ) notable advancements in the P&C sector are one of its main advantages. Compared to Q1 2023, the P&C combined ratio increased by 13 points to 99.9% in Q1 2024. The combined ratio is the percentage of the premiums an insurer collects that it pays out in claims and expenses, before counting its profits from investing those premiums. This improvement shows that the segment’s cost control and efficiency have improved. The segment’s $11 million profit represented a substantial improvement over the previous year’s deficit and showed the value of the company’s multi-year profitability restoration plan. Additionally, Horace Mann projects overall premium increases in cars and property of around 40% and 50% , respectively, from 2022 to 2024. This calculated action aims to increase profitability. Further, the policyholder retention has stayed the same despite these significant premium hikes, indicating consumer loyalty and contentment with the value offered by the business. Thus, the steady retention rates in the face of increasing premiums demonstrate the efficacy of Horace Mann’s client retention techniques. Further, Q1 catastrophe losses were higher than the 10-year and five-year norms . However, they were less than 2023 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Overall, the resilience and effectiveness of the company’s claims management practices are demonstrated by its fundamental ability to manage higher catastrophic losses while increasing the consolidated bottom line. Columbia Banking System (COLB) Columbia Banking System (NASDAQ: COLB ) delivered operational EPS of $0.65 and $0.59 for Q1 2024. The company uses equity capital effectively, reflected in the operational return of 16% for tangible equity on average, reflecting its high returns to shareholders. Further, Q1’s net interest income of $423 million represented a $30 million decline from the prior quarter. This is mostly due to increased deposit expenses and decreased revenue from investment securities. Despite this drop, the net interest margin (NIM) was 3.52% , falling between the predicted range of 3.45% and 3.60%. Notably, price reductions on wholesale and promotional funding caused the NIM to rise to 3.55% in March. Thus, this demonstrates successful margin management in a challenging environment for interest rates. Lastly, for Q1, Columbia Banking System saw growth in deposits of $100 million and loans of $200 million. After declining in January, non-sparing demand deposits stabilized in February and March , indicating a stabilizing deposit base. Thus, it is evident that the company’s main strength that supports its expansion plan is its capacity to increase its balance sheet. As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in HMN and COLB. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

        "content": "Article content A North Vancouver man is facing charges after a knife-wielding man damaged several cars in Deep Cove over the weekend, then went after a motorcyclist with the weapon. North Vancouver RCMP were called about a man reportedly slashing cars near Deep Cove Road and Mount Seymour Parkway, not far from The Raven pub in the District of North Vancouver, at about 3 p.m. Saturday. “It is alleged the man was carrying a knife and using it to damage cars,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak in a news release on Monday. “The man then allegedly attacked a motorcyclist, striking his helmet with the knife, but fortunately, causing no injury. “The motorcyclist did sustain minor injuries as a result of falling, and was led to safety by a motorist at the scene.” Officers flooded the scene within minutes and arrested a suspect. Police allege the suspect assaulted an officer while in custody. North Van District Mayor Mike Little went to the scene on Saturday. “Deep Cove is a very safe area so this violent act comes as a complete shock,” said Little in a text exchange on Monday. “This could have been much more serious if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of a bystander who protected the victim in their car, and also thanks to the RCMP for their quick action.” On Sunday, prosecutors charged Alexander Currie with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault of a police officer and weapon possession. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Sahak. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passerby motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said the RCMP victim services unit is available 24/7 for anyone struggling emotionally by calling 604-969-7540. Witnesses who haven’t spoken to police are asked to call 604-985-1311. Richmond RCMP are hoping witnesses have dashcam footage after a traffic cop was forced to leap out of the way to avoid being hit by a speeding car last week. A road safety unit was cracking down on speeders on Highway 91 near the Knight Street Bridge on May 19 when an officer allegedly clocked a vehicle going 145 km/h in an 80 km zone. The officer on foot tried to stop the vehicle, but it didn’t stop and the Mountie had to dive to the side of the road to avoid getting hit. “Fortunately, our officer was not seriously injured, but this type of driving behaviour puts all road users at risk,” said Sgt. Eric Baskette of the road safety unit. Investigators are asking anyone who was in the area between 8:40 and 9:10 a.m. to check dashcam footage. The suspect was in a black sedan with a broken passenger-side mirror that was last seen headed east on Highway 91. Anyone with information or video is asked to call Richmond RCMP at 604-278-1212 or Crime Stoppers, 1-800-222-8477, or make a report at . A man wanted for assault and drug charges in Surrey and Langley who missed a court date in February is in custody. Surrey RCMP say Arandeep Gill, 34, failed to show up in court on Feb. 9 to face eight charges including assault and assault with a weapon. He was also wanted on three charges in Langley for possession of drugs for trafficking purposes and dangerous operation of a vehicle. Gill was arrested at a home in the 10400-block of University Drive late Sunday afternoon by Surrey RCMP, an integrated emergency response team, crisis negotiators, police dogs and a gang enforcement team.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match. The Schedule — Monday-Tuesday: First Round (Women and Men) — Wednesday-Thursday: Second Round (Women and Men) — May 31-June 1: Third Round (Women and Men) — June 2-3: Fourth Round (Women and Men) — June 4-5: Quarterfinals (Women and Men) — June 6: Women’s Semifinals — June 7: Men’s Semifinals — June 8: Women’s Final — June 9: Men’s Final A Quiz About Nadal Try your hand at the AP’s quiz about Rafael Nadal .

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth's late husband, Prince Philip, was known for his sense of humour and sometimes off-colour gaffes.",
        "content": "Prince William hosts garden party at Buckingham Palace Prince Philip, who was known for his frankness and quick wit, left his grandson, Prince William , in stitches after making a sweary remark during a photoshoot. Despite not being the head of the monarchy, Prince Philip wielded significant influence behind the scenes, and his passing in 2021 prompted an outpouring of heartfelt tributes from fellow royals. Prince Harry lauded his late grandfather's \"seriously sharp wit\" and his knack for \"holding the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next.\" Prince William was all too familiar with his grandfather's propensity for off-the-cuff remarks, and was once spotted trying to suppress his laughter when Philip lost his cool. It happened in 2015, during the 75th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Britain - a pivotal event in World War II where the British Armed Forces defended Great Britain against German air attacks.

The photographer was taking his time getting everyone ready for the picture, which irked Prince Philip, who was 94 years old at the time. Philip, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, snapped - and used some pretty informal language to make his displeasure known. \"Just take the f*****g picture,\" Philip told the photographer, a moment that was caught on film by the Telegraph.

Philip's son Prince Edward - who now holds his late father's title of Duke of Edinburgh - also seemed to attempt to hold in his own giggles at Philip's impatience. Needless to say, the photographer quickly obeyed Philip's pretty brusque request, and once the picture was successfully captured, Philip was free to leave his posed seated position and got up immediately.

        "description": "The aircraft is the fifth to join the airline's fleet.",
        "content": "The gang is finally together! On Saturday, Azul Linhas Aéreas received its final Disney-liveried aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, with Goofy as the main character. In 2023, announced it would add a fifth Disney-themed aircraft to its fleet. At the time, it had already received four and had completed the “family,” or so we thought. Every one of the planes has been a new delivery from the Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France. Azul has nicknamed its Disney planes the “Magical Fleet,” playing on Disney’s marketing. Yesterday, the family was complete with the arrival of Goofy. The new aircraft is an Airbus A320neo. It began its journey from Europe on Friday and arrived on Saturday night at Aeroporto Internacional Belo Horizonte (commonly referred to as Confins because of its location near the city). There, the aircraft will go through its certification procedures to join the airline’s operations. According to Azul, the livery was designed by Walt Disney World Resort artists. The livery highlights Goofy’s special characteristics, like his iconic ears. After its assembly in Toulouse, the A320neo was painted at Airbus and delivered to the airline. “The aircraft in the ‘Most Magical Fleet In The World’ are very special to us at Azul because of the way they make customers happy and impact the customer experience. The happiness and sparkle in the eyes of adults and children when they discover they are flying on one of these planes is evident. Goofy is a classic, representing diversity and good humor, and we believe that the aircraft does just that.” Daniel Bicudo, Marketing and Business Director, Azul Linhas Aéreas In November 2021, Azul received its first Disney aircraft, ‘Mickey Mouse Nas Nuvens.’ Like Goofy, the Mickey plane is an Airbus A320neo. Registered as PR-YSH, the A320neo was the 50th of the type to join the airline’s fleet. Mickey was followed by ‘Minnie Mouse Nas Nuvens’ and ‘Pato Donald Nas Nuvens’, in February and June of 2022, respectively. The Minnie Mouse aircraft is the only one in the fleet on an A321neo, of which Azul has only six. When the Daisy aircraft joined the fleet, it was thought it would be the final one. Then, in February of 2023, the airline announced a pleasant surprise: there would be a fifth aircraft. There had been speculation for a long time that there would be a fifth plane and that it would be Goofy. And the rumors were true. Azul held a special event at its Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) hangar at Aeroporto Internacional de Viracopos, its main hub, to announce the fifth aircraft. All the characters from the first four planes made a special appearance, and two Brazilian singers gave a special performance of When You Wish Upon A Star. Azul’s CEO and Disney Destinations’ Senior Vice President were present to make the announcement.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The Transmission Company of Nigeria, (TCN) on Monday decried the increasing spate of vandalism of electricity assets in the North East region, saying that as its engineers are working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three towers along the Biu – Danbua 132kV transmission line were also vandalized with 16 spans of conductors stolen. Ndidi Mbah, the General Manager, Public Affairs, who made this known in a statement, said that these vandalism incidents collapse three towers along Biu-Dambua 132kV and remove tower members on one tower along Makurdi-Jos 330kV transmission line. According to the statement, the incident occurred at about 7am, on 27th May, 2024, morning while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line the same day. “TCN hereby states that tower number T290, one of the four new towers erected by TCN contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330kV transmission line collapsed during the cable stringing process. “The incident occurred at about 7am, this morning, 27th May, 2024, while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line today. “Despite of the security challenges in the area, TCN contractors and some of our engineering staff worked tirelessly to fast-track the project, doing all that was humanly possible to meet the time-line. Daily, the contractor, TCN engineers accompanied by security operatives consistently left the site by 10pm in the night and resumed work at 6am every day. “Constructing towers and stringing power cables at such heights is highly technical, although TCN contractors and staff have successfully completed similar projects in other parts of the country. The collapse of the fourth tower is a significant setback, given the extensive efforts to ensure that today’s power restoration timeline was met. “Our contractor is currently dismantling the collapsed tower members, to enable its reconstruction and final restringing of the cable. “It is unfortunate to note that while TCN is working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three (3) towers along the Biu – Danbua 132kV transmission line were also vandalized with 16 spans of conductors stolen. The towers, which have all collapsed include towers T1690, T1691 and T1692. TCN has mobilized a contractor to commence their reconstruction. This discovery was made by TCN patrol team, last Friday. “Additionally, this morning, the TCN lines patrol team discovered that tower T540 along the Makurdi – Jos 330kV double circuit transmission line has been vandalised. Sections of the tower have been removed, although the tower remains standing. TCN has contracted emergency repairs, to prevent its collapse. “We reiterate our commitment to restoring normal bulk power supply through the distribution companies serving the North East and other areas affected by vandalism. There is however an urgent need for everyone to join hand with TCN in protecting our collective assets by being vigilant and reporting any suspected acts of tower and line vandalism promptly” the statement reads in parts.",

        "content": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Java Blend employees have won their union. After a settlement was reached yesterday, ballots cast a year ago in a vote to unionize were finally counted this morning – and 91% of workers voted to join SEIU Local 2. “We are very proud – this wasn’t easy,” said Andy Mawko, one of the worker leaders. “We stood up for ourselves and fought for what was right. When we fight, we win!” “We are excited to start negotiations in good faith as soon as possible,” said Em Kristensen, another one of the terminated leaders. “We are looking forward to winning a collective agreement that addresses concerns like job security, health and safety protections and setting the foundation for a long-term relationship between the Java Blend and our Union.” This is a big win for the workers at Java Blend. “We have an important message to the beautiful community that supported us,” said Cailen Pygott. “Together, we can achieve incredible things! From regular customers to prominent leaders, artists like El Jones, and from businesses that believe in doing the right thing: Thank you. Halifax is a Union town — and we encourage all non-union service workers to unite and organize.” There is an agreement to start good faith bargaining soon and to reach the best possible collective agreement over the next four weeks. The agreement includes a provision to start recalling terminated employees; their dismissal was the subject of an Unfair Labour Practice complaint filed by SEIU, which has now been withdrawn. The Union won a bargaining unit that includes the Java Blend cafes on North St and Sackville in Halifax, the production and roastery warehouse on Borden Ave. in Dartmouth, as well as the Cortado Tasting Room in Bedford. If a deal is not ratified in the agreed timeframe, the parties have agreed to conciliation. The Union has called off the boycott of Java Blend and all it’s products.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — UCLA Chancellor Gene Block found himself in the nation’s culture wars hot seat this past week, interrogated by members of Congress about his handling of complaints of campus antisemitism, amid student protests over the Israel-Hamas war. For Republican Congress members, the hearing organized by the GOP-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce was a chance to present the University of California, Los Angeles as exhibit A in how not to deal with protests. Almost as soon as activists set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment April 25 in the heart of campus, Jewish students and faculty complained that demonstrators established checkpoints restricting access to many students, at times singling out students they identified as Zionists. After pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacked the encampment on April 30, it was dismantled May 2, with law enforcement arresting more than 200 people. “Over the course of years, decades even, universities gradually nurtured a campus culture of radicalism, in which antisemitism grew and became tolerated by administrators,” Virginia Foxx, the commitee chair, said in her opening remarks. The Republican from North Carolina assailed Block for allowing UCLA’s protests to spiral out of control. “For days, you stood by as Jews were assaulted and illegal checkpoints blocked access to campus in broad daylight,” Foxx said. “Your actions were too little, too late.” In his opening testimony, Block conceded that UCLA made errors in judgment. The encampment, he said, “disrupted normal access to some classes” and “impeded our educational mission.” “With the benefit of hindsight,” he said, “we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.” Block did not specify what UCLA should have done to prevent discrimination or violence as protests ramped up. And he did not explain why the university did not take action as students reported discrimination from protesters and outside agitators gathered on campus. Striking a mild, noncombative approach throughout, Block did not say what campus discipline had been — or would be — meted out to students who violated UCLA rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized UCLA leaders for standing by for hours as a “mob of agitators” gathered near the encampment. Block said he rejected the premise of the question. Block said the Los Angeles Police Department was working to identify the attackers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican, asked Block whether physically obstructing students from entering campus based on their race, ethnicity or religion is an expellable offense. ‘There is a disciplinary process,” Block said. “It could be.” Kiley played a viral video showing UCLA protesters blocking a student, Eli Tsives, from passing a checkpoint. “Were those students who formed blockade?” Kiley said. “Were they disciplined?” Block said he didn’t know, repeating that he sent out a memo April 30 instructing the campus community that blocking students’ passage was intolerable. Block, who is Jewish and has family members who died in the Holocaust, said UCLA has a problem with antisemitism. “I am fully aware that many of our Jewish students have had to confront rhetoric and images on campus that any reasonable person would find repugnant,” Block said in his opening statement. “Trust me, I understand their pain.” Asked by Rep. Kathy Manning, a Democrat from North Carolina, about emails dating to 2014 that show alumni had alerted the chancellor of growing antisemitism, Block said the university had tried to respond with training. About 90 percent of students, he said, had taken an online training course that includes discussion of antisemitism. Manning asked whether students and staff need additional training. “I think we need to do more,” Block said.",

        "content": "A woman will stand trial Aug. 19 for allegedly possessing almost 2 pounds of cocaine in her residence. Charnelle N. Mond, 27, listed with an alternate residence in , appeared Friday in and entered a not-guilty plea for a charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, a Class X felony. Mond was charged April 25 after drug agents raided a Peru dwelling and seized about 900 grams of purported cocaine, according to prosecutors. Elevated drug felonies are weight-dependent, meaning Mond could face 12 to 50 years in prison if convicted and if lab testing confirms the volume reached 900 grams. Mond, who was granted the services of a public defender, will next appear Aug. 9 for a motions hearing. She had been granted pretrial release. Mond was charged after the Tri-County Drug Enforcement Narcotics Team and Peru police officers executed a search warrant of Mond’s residence and found ammunition and guns (including a stolen shotgun, police said) “littered throughout” the residence, prosecutors had said. Although Mond had a firearm owner’s identification card, a second individual is charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon in addition to the drug charge. Robert L. Wright Jr., 38, was denied pretrial release in part because authorities allege that the convicted felon was within “arm’s reach” of a firearm during the drug raid, the judge had said. Wright is in custody and thus is subject to a speedier trial demand. He will next appear July 11 for a motions hearing and again July 18 for a final pretrial conference.",

        "content": "Locals in a Devon town centre have 'protested' against a controversial works scheme by removing cones from parking spaces. The contentious plan to revamp Queen Street in Newton Abbot is set to start tomorrow (May 28) but yellow cones were placed in parking bays along the street earlier today. One resident reportedly took it upon themselves to pick up the cones and stack them up on the pavement to make way for vehicles to park. One witness who took pictures of the stacked up cones told DevonLive: \"Cone rebellion going on in Newton Abbot due to the extremely controversial closing of Queen Street to traffic. It's in part an organised protest.\" According to the Devon County Council website, the works on Queen Street are due to start on Tuesday. It will affect the section of Queen Street between Courtenay Street and The Avenue, and a number of the surrounding junctions and side roads.

The council said its goal is to finish all the improvements by the end of November 2024, in time for the busy Christmas shopping season. The scheme includes a range of improvements such as widening footways, enhancing pedestrian crossings, reducing speed limits, upgrading the bus stop, and introducing more greenery and public seating. Throughout the duration of the work, parking for blue badge holders will continue to be available in both Queen Street and nearby Victoria Place. Businesses will operate as usual and once the work commences, information boards and drop-in sessions will keep traders, shoppers, and residents updated on the plans, their progress, and any potential impact on shoppers or road users. However, the scheme will see the majority of on-street parking in Queen Street removed. Access to the section of Queen Street beyond the junction with Albany Street will be restricted to buses, pedestrians, cycles and loading. Devon County Council said during the construction phases, the current level of parking availability will be maintained as far as possible however during each phase, some parking bays might be occupied for construction and safety reasons. ⚠️ Want the latest Devon breaking news and top stories first?

        "content": "In a bid to remove obstacles hindering the growth of Nigerian shipping sector, the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) is seeking for a new a act the will open up the industry to compete, while setting specific roles that will guide operation for efficiency . ALSO READ: Maritime security: House Committee seeks alternate funding for Deep Blue project Speaking at the stakeholders public hearing of the new bill on Monday before the House Committee on Shipping Services and Committee on ports and harbor in Abuja, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Barrister Puis Akutah said the proposed new regulatory framework will encourage more private sector participation in the sector. The ES explained that the bill seeks to enhance efficiency, promote ease of doing business, and create cost-effectiveness in the shipping sector while promoting seamless cargo movement within and outside African continent. “If passed into law, the bill will promote competition, ensure consumer protection, and elevate service quality standards. It mandates all stakeholders to adhere to regulations, preventing monopolistic practices, excessive pricing, and arbitrary behaviors. Regulators will be empowered to enforce rules impartially and provide necessary administrative and political support.” Akutah further stated that to maintain a level playing field and uphold fair trade practices without adding undue financial burdens, the bill proposes retaining the 1% fair standardisation fee as a funding source. He said the proposed bill, if enacted, promises to revolutionise the industry, creating a conducive environment for business growth, investment, and job creation while safeguarding consumer interests and promoting fair competition. The NSC boss notes that the legislative move aims to transform Nigeria’s shipping and ports sector into a dynamic force for economic growth, revenue generation, and employment sustainability. In his address, the Speaker of the House of Representative, Tajudeen Abbas reaffirmed that the bill will empower shippers council with the needed authority to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian’s maritime sector. Represented by Sani Suli, the Speaker stated that the new legislative work seek to streamline procedures and eliminate any constraints that were present in the 2004 Ac. He explained that the reenactment of the new bill will not only ensure an economic regulatory framework for NSC for effective regulation of commercial activities in the shipping port sector, but the bill will also create friendly environment for private sector participation for the growth of the industry. “The bill lays out financial provisions, define guidelines for the allocation, management and auditing of funds, which is crucial for maintaining financial integrity and providing the council with the necessary resources to perform its duties,” he noted.",

        "content": "The internet never sleeps, giving us a never-ending news cycle. While we ought to keep you posted with all the latest happenings in the tech world, a few gems slip through the cracks. Fear not, because we’ve got you covered. Welcome to our first edition of “News You Probably Missed and Shouldn’t Have!”—the weekly roundup of stories that deserve the spotlight. So, buckle up, because while these headlines may not have made the front page, they’re definitely worthy of a glance, or maybe two—and a chuckle. Prepare to be entertained by the tech news that somehow evaded your social media feeds (we know social media is your ultimate news destination). Let’s get started! Samsung & ARM start laying the foundation for 6G Smartphone giant Samsung and processor IP maker ARM are gearing up for the next big thing in mobile data: 6G. Yes, while most of us are still trying to find a decent 5G signal or even 4G in some places, these tech titans are already plotting the future. The two firms have started laying the foundation for the next generation of wireless communication technology. Current estimates are that it will take another five or six years for 6G to be available commercially. Tell you what, there might be a pattern here—4G debuted in 2009 and 5G in 2019. Is anyone betting on a 6G launch in 2029? We aren’t. But people say AI will revolutionize the tech landscape in the years to come. Who knows the so-called faster internet will come to us faster. For now, let’s hope 6G doesn’t stand for “6th Generation of Disappointment”! Samsung appoints a new head of its semiconductor division Samsung has appointed Young Hyun Jun as the new head of its Device Solutions Division which incorporates its semiconductor business. With a career spanning over two decades across various roles within the company’s semiconductor unit, the 64-year-old Young is stepping into a key position responsible for advancing the Korean firm’s chip technology. Given the sub-par performance of its Exynos chips in the past, let’s hope he brings a secret sauce to finally spice things up. TSMC would kill itself rather than live under Chinese control TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, has contingency plans against a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan that could hand over its controls to Beijing. While the US is already scared about the implications of such an event and rightly so, the Taiwanese company itself doesn’t want to live under Chinese control. It has worked with its Dutch chip machine supplier ASML on a tech that would remotely disable the chip machines and render them useless in the event of an invasion. Imagine the chaos: Chinese invaders storming in only to find TSMC’s factory turned into a high-tech ghost town. It would be no less than a scene from a sci-fi movie where the robots revolt. But in this case, the machines pull the plug on themselves rather than attacking the attackers. TSMC’s influence in the tech industry is an example of why regulators want to break big internet companies like Google. When things go bad, it could send the world into disarray. Installing PWAs and Android apps made easy on Chrome OS Google has introduced an “Add to Chromebook” badge and “ChromeOS app URL” to make it easier for Chrome OS users to install Android apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). The badge takes users to the Play Store listing of an Android app. In the case of PWAs, those can be installed from anywhere . You no longer have to be inside a PWA in a browser tab to get an install button. Thanks, Google! You finally figured out that users were fumbling around, asking, “PWA (Please, Where’s the App)?” Humane is looking for humans to buy it out After a delay, Humane finally started selling its much-hyped Ai Pin last month. It was supposed to be a revolutionary AI companion to assist you with various tasks, potentially replacing your smartphone in some. However, the voice-controlled wearable device with a built-in digital assistant had poor word of mouth and never took off. Barely a month after Humane started selling its first and only product, it is now seeking buyers for itself . The AI startup hasn’t officially announced that it is looking for humans willing to buy it. However, people familiar with the matter say Humane will gleefully hand over its reigns to a new owner for anything between $750 million and $1 billion. If this sale goes through within the next few months, it might set a new record for a startup’s first product launch to a potential buyout. The AI landscape isn’t all sunshine and roses, it seems. TikTok to lay off over 1,000 employees Ahead of a potential reduction in its user base (a US ban would cut affect over 170 million users), TikTok is shrinking its workforce. The ByteDance-owned company is planning a major layoff affecting over 1,000 employees . The job cut will hit various internal teams and departments—probably not the legal department (it needs a lot of legal experts to work in tandem if it were to live on in the US beyond January 2025). So, while TikTok dances its way through the courts, some of its employees may be soon left doing the cha-cha slide out the door. Windows PowerToys unleashes advanced AI copy-paste PowerToys for Windows 11 has just added a new AI tool: Advanced Paste. It lets you convert your clipboard content on the fly, speeding up your workflow. You can copy code in one language and paste it in another. You can also run other types of conversions before pasting, including summarizing text, translating it to a different language, and rephrasing it to change its tone. Gone are the days of accidentally pasting cat memes into serious work documents—what you paste is always on point. But hey, this tool is super useful, so you have to pay us. Not us, but those who brought it to you. Available with PowerToys version 0.81 , you can enable Advanced Paste using the key combination “Windows Key + Shift + V”. But to use it to its full potential, you need to link your OpenAI account and buy OpenAI API credits. Nah, a paid ChatGPT account doesn’t give you API credits. YouTube is testing a redesigned layout, again YouTube regularly tests UI redesigns and tweaks to give users a pixel-perfect viewing experience that’s smoother than a cat’s nap. It keeps what works and discards what doesn’t. The company appears to be preparing another redesign. On the desktop version, it is moving the video title, description, comments, and other buttons to the right side. The video appears on the left , with recommendations showing up with bigger thumbnails directly under it. This redesign has been in the works for a while now but hasn’t shown up for many. We certainly don’t want it in its current state—those big thumbnails under the video are massive distractions. How come YouTube UI designers do not see that? Or they just turned a blind eye to it? Come on Google, you are better than this (or at least the world thinks you are). Xiaomi to make its own smartphone chipsets Xiaomi seems to be fed up with the lack of choices when it comes to smartphone processors. It is making its own. Codenamed “Ring,” the chipset is currently in development with the high-end segment in mind. The chip may still be far away but the Chinese firm appears determined to make a groundbreaking entry in a few years and shake the flagship SoC market currently captured by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon and MediaTek’s Dimensity chips. Samsung also makes Exynos-branded flagships SoCs, but those have always been sub-par. Wouldn’t it be amazing if Xiaomi came along and made a better chip than Samsung right away? Adaptive Audio for Google Meet Google Meet is stepping up its audio game with the introduction of Adaptive Audio . It is a game-changing feature that ensures your virtual meetings sound as clear as a bell. The new feature can detect the presence of multiple laptops in the room (and multiple people shouting at their bosses at once—just kidding, you shouldn’t shout at anyone, unless your boss is a clod) and synchronize the microphones and speakers to eliminate echoes and audio feedback. This allows you and your colleagues to participate in meetings from anywhere. Bluesky adds DMs, finally BlueSky, Twitter’s decentralized dream, is finally adding DMs . You can now send messages to your friends and families via the app. If they are on it, of course (don’t be surprised if some of them point upwards when you ask them what Bluesky is). DMs work on the app and website but only support text conversations in one-to-one chats. No group chats and media support, oh, really? The company says these features, along with end-to-end encryption, are planned for later. Snapseed gets a rare update Snapseed, the Google-owned photo editing software tool for mobile devices, recently picked up a minor update. This is the first update for the app in nearly eight months . It brings version 2.22 with no user-facing changes or functional improvements. Considering how rare updates for Snapseed are (feature updates are even rarer), Google seems to be losing interest in it. The company acquired the tool in 2012 and appears to have little incentive to support it further. We wouldn’t be surprised if the app ends up in the Google Graveyard in a few years. Help yourself to disabling Chrome’s “Help me write” AI tool Are you fed up with AI tools interrupting you unnecessarily? Some Chrome users may have been. Google recently started actively pushing a “Help me write: Powered by Google” bubble in Chrome to promote its experimental writing assistant. Thankfully, if you are annoyed by this bubble, you can disable it . To do that, go to Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings > Content > Additional content settings > Offer writing help (at the bottom). Google couldn’t have made it more difficult to disable this tool. WhatsApp is working on AI-generated profile photos AI is coming everywhere and you can’t do anything about it. You may be able to disable some AI tools (like Google’s “Help me write” for Chrome), but you will encounter more of them in other places. WhatsApp may soon introduce one. The Meta-owned messaging app is working on AI-generated profile photos (but why?). Because who needs a regular selfie when you can have an AI-generated masterpiece, right? No, we don’t need a virtual Picasso painting our profile pictures. But then again, all tech firms have to show that their products boast the latest AI tools. While AI is undeniably powerful, it feels like tech companies sometimes rely too heavily on it as a buzzword rather than focusing on meaningful advancements. It’s like promising a gourmet meal and delivering a reheated TV dinner—underwhelming and lacking that wow factor. Someone at X doesn’t like to show “likes” publicly X, the social media platform we knew as Twitter before the Elon Musk era, will soon stop showing the posts you have liked to other users. The company is making likes private because “public likes are incentivizing the wrong behavior.” People avoid liking some posts fearing retaliation from trolls. While liking posts on X may not be as nerve-racking as navigating a minefield, this move from X will certainly help people maintain a pristine online image while still enjoying the content they love. It’s like a digital self-care package. AI is coming to Amazon Alexa too, but at a price Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant is getting an AI makeover. The company is working on new generative AI capabilities for the decade-old assistant. However, unlike most other companies, it won’t make the AI features free. The e-commerce giant would charge a monthly subscription for it . Worse yet, it won’t be included in an Amazon Prime subscription. The question is, how many people would be willing to pay Amazon for AI features available free elsewhere? It’s like inviting a brainy friend to the party but having to pay a cover charge for their wit and wisdom. But hey, maybe Amazon will pave the way for an AI subscription model in the virtual assistant realm, and everyone will follow, leaving users with no other choice. Only time will tell. TikTok disrupted over a dozen covert influence campaigns this year TikTok has disrupted more than a dozen covert influence campaigns since January this year. The company has placed measures to detect such campaigns where several accounts coordinate to sway political discourse. It removes accounts engaging in these kinds of practices. It has already detected 15 influence campaigns this year, including one originating from China. These campaigns spanned 3,000 accounts that had millions of followers combined. Great job, TikTok. We don’t get many chances to say that, do we? HMD Aura is an incredibly affordable Android smartphone HMD has launched Aura, an incredibly affordable Android smartphone. Priced at AUD 180 (approx. USD 120), it offers a decent set of specs for its price. It appears to be currently limited to Australia, where potential buyers can find it on local retailer JB Hi-Fi . There is no word on its availability elsewhere. It is unclear if HMD will showcase Aura’s aura in other parts of the world. As for its specs, the phone has a 6.56-inch HD+ display, a 13MP main camera, a 5MP selfie camera, a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, a Unisoc SC9863A1 processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage (supports microSD cards up to 256GB), dual SIM support, a USB Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It packs a 5,000 mAh battery and supports 10W wired charging. YouTube Music lets you hum to find songs YouTube Music is bringing a musical genie to your phone. Even if you have forgotten a song’s lyrics, title, artists, and all, you can still magically find the song that’s playing in your mind. Just hum its tune, and presto—your phone magically finds the song for you . With “Hum to search,” you don’t have to make multiple Google searches with vague descriptions to find that one song. The new feature is available with version 7.02 of YouTube Music for Android, though it may take a while before this ability reaches everyone.",

A shocked family has released CCTV footage showing a lone lioness entering their compound in Kenya late at night and leaving with their dog. In the video, which was released this weekend, the lion is seen lurking in the shadows of a well-lit street on the outskirts of Nairobi. The big cat is seen easily traversing the property's walls, dropping down into the garden and leaving with the 75kg dog in its mouth. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) The bereaved family has told of their shock at the incident - and shown the aftermath of the unsettling event.

They were dotted with lion prints, showing the route the cat took when it entered her home. Joshua Isigi, a worker, said he attempted to scare the lion off after he noticed it had gained entry. He told reporters he picked up a machete and \"scraped it against some iron sheets\" in a bid to shoo it away. Don't miss...

When it emerged, Ms Wamai said, it wasn't even 10 minutes later, and she added: \"Just like that, we lost our dog.\" Jaci and her twin Rottweiler Laser had been with the family for two years before she was taken. Trending Ms Wamai said that her family is shocked and devastated and that it has made giving their other dog love more difficult. Sylvia, whose family are shocked and devastated, said: \"It’s hard to give one dog love and then remember the other was taken. And it wasn’t a normal death.

        "description": "Stormy Daniels reveals death threats she has received since Donald Trump's hush money trial.",
        "content": "President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal , the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. Trump blasted for 'disrespectful' saluting blunder - sparking huge rules debate Donald Trump named fattest US president in history due to McDonald's addiction And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” If you or someone you know needs support now, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org",

        "content": "U.Today - A substantial withdrawal of 1,195 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $81.95 million, has been made from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This transfer to an unknown address has caught the attention of the crypto community as, typically, massive withdrawals from exchanges are perceived as bullish signals for the price. The logic is simple: large investors buy digital assets on liquid platforms like Binance and then move them to private wallets for storage, indicating long-term holding strategies. Diving deeper into the data we can learn that the address \"bc1qm34\" hosted by the exchange transferred millions of tokens to \"1126a\" in one tranche. This address is relatively fresh and was activated a month ago by a transfer from the same Binance - for 89,668 BTC, equivalent to $5.62 million. In general, all interactions of this address are related to Binance, as well as the address \"bc1q7.\" That is, funds move only between these three addresses. A deeper dive through Arkham Intelligence data, however, reveals that the address in question may belong to Ceffu - an institutional digital asset platform offering custody and liquidity solutions. The second address, however, also belongs to the platform and is its custodial address. It now holds 250.219 BTC worth $17.45 million. Thus, it can be stated that there is no special mystery and mysticism in this transfer - just one platform withdraws Bitcoin from the largest, and in fact, liquid, platform for its own needs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to trade around $70,000 per coin. Toward the end of the day today, the price of the main cryptocurrency is adding more than 2%. To reach the absolute maximum price of Bitcoin, at $74,000, less than 5.5% remains. This content was originally published on U.Today",

        "description": "The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time.",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma, whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party. That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until ''Jesus comes back.'' Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. ''They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,'' Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. ''He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?'' Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. ''I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,'' Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party's symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing's logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country's population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa's poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. ''I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,'' Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. ''It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,'' Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. ''uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. ''The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.'' His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK's symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield. ___ AP Africa news: https://apnews.com/hub/africa",

        "content": "Stormy Daniels revealed she has received death threats (Image: MySpace) President Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels, the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal, the Daily Mirror has revealed. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. READ MORE: Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' [LATEST] Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar’, ‘slut’, ‘gold digger’. This time around, it’s different. “It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat’.” The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump (Image: GETTY) “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time in the UK tonight [TUES] on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” She adds that that is a ‘direct threat’. Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again”. Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over. Her life has been transformed but she’s determined not to give up. She says: “I won’t give up as I’m telling the truth. “And I kind of don’t know if that matters anymore.” Stormy premieres Tuesday, May 28, Channel 5, 10pm and is also available to stream on My5.

        "content": "Members of American Legion Post 38 place a wreath near the flag pole at the Mill Springs National Cemetery. The placement of the wreath was part of Monday's Memorial Day services. The dedication of those who have served our country and who have since passed away – in wartime and in times of peace – was honored Monday in a gathering at Mill Springs National Cemetery in Nancy. Those who wanted to pay tribute the men and women who served in the U.S. Military joined American Legion Post 38, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the members of the National Parks Service who oversee the Mill Springs Battlefield and Visitors Center in remembering all those who have gone before us. The ceremony was conducted as part of Memorial Day activities being held at both the National Cemetery and the Civil War-era battlefield. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in preserving liberty and peace for our nation,” said main speaker Allen Boone, retired lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. LTC Ret. Allen Boone speaks to the crowd during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs. “The Civil War alone had over 700,000 men and women who died in service. Their sacrifices are etched in history, a solemn testament to their bravery and dedication. These men and women understood the meaning of putting others before self. They were dedicated to fulfill their mission at all costs. And as we ponder their sacrifices, our hearts should be filled with gratitude for their willingness to serve against foreign and domestic enemies who sought to destroy our nation,” Boone said. Boone himself has served in active duty, having been in two tours of duty in Iraq. Boone, who currently lives in Lexington, has a masters degree in Management and Leadership from Liberty University and is a graduate of Command and General Staff College. “This day is not just about a day of remembering,” Boone said. “It is time for us to act. As we honor their memory, we pledge that their lives, that their sacrifices, that their valor shall never be forgotten. Let us also pledge to do the utmost and carry out what must, and what they wished for us, in that no other generation of young men and women would have to share their experiences and repeat their sacrifice.” Clarence Floyd, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain, leads the crowd in prayer during Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony at Mill Springs National Cemetery. As part of Monday’s ceremony, American Legion Post 38 Chaplain Clarence Floyd led the crowd in a prayer, in which he said, “As we look across, and as we see all these white markers, Lord, we know that was one of our brothers or sisters, but Lord, they also had a family, and we pray for every one of them and for the life that they lived and for the influence they had on other people.” The ceremony proved bittersweet for Floyd, as he announced he would be retiring as chaplain soon, after 17 years of service with Post 38’s Color Guard. The Color Guard itself bookended the service, by both leading the opening parade which presented the colors, and by completing the service with a 21-gun salute and the playing of Taps. Members of the American Legion Post 38 Color Guard present the colors during the opening parade to Monday's Memorial Day Ceremony. Also during the ceremony, a commemorative wreath was placed at the cemetery’s flag pole, near the grave of Sgt. Brent Woods, a Buffalo Soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor after an event in August 1881 in which he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.",

        "content": "Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, who is considered as a role model and source of inspiration by many for her talent and accomplishments, has redefined the role of women in the society. Though the women all over the world have outgrown the societal barriers and done wonders by their work in various fields, society in the South Asian countries still see females in limited roles. The 37-year-old sportswoman, who has seen the epitome of success and fame owing to her skills and brilliance as a professional tennis player, believes that the women are not just about beauty or their knack in the kitchen. Being a mother and a celebrity all at the same time, Sania is of the view that women are much more than what society wants them to be. “Women are not just supposed to look pretty and cook. They are more than that,” she told leading Indian magazine Famina in a recent interview. The quote was shared by the journal on their official Instagram and reshared by Sania on her Instagram stories. It may be noted that the Indian tennis ace is mother to six-year-old Izhaan Mirza Malik. Despite having taken retirement from professional tennis, Sania is widely followed for her charismatic personality and sparkling career.",

        "content": "The Guardians have released outfielder Ramon Laureano , according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. He’ll now head to the open market and will be free to explore opportunities with all clubs. This was the most likely outcome when the Guardians designated Laureano for assignment last week. The outfielder’s production has been trending down for a few years now and is at an especially low point this year. The 29-year-old has hit .143/.265/.229 thus far in 2024 while striking out 38.6 percent of the time. On top of his poor performance, his salary has been creeping up gradually via the arbitration process. He’s making $5.15M this year and any team acquiring him via a waiver claim or trade would have been taking on that money. It’s unsurprising that no club wanted to take that on, given how he has been playing of late. He has more than five years of service time, meaning he can reject an outright assignment while also keeping that salary in place. Now that he is a free agent, teams may be interested in a low-cost flier. Since he’s now been released, the Guardians are on the hook for what’s left of the money, meaning that any club that signs him would only be responsible for the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the roster. That amount would be subtracted from what the Guards pay. It’s been a few years now, but Laureano was once a solid regular for the Athletics. From 2018 to 2021, he stepped to the plate 1,257 times for the A’s and hit 49 home runs. His .263/.335/.465 batting line translated to a wRC+ of 119, indicating he was 19 percent above league average in that time. He also stole 34 bases and was generally given strong defensive grades, leading FanGraphs to credit him with 8.6 wins above replacement in 313 games. But towards the end of that 2021 season, he was given an 80-game PED suspension and his performance has been tailing off since then. He hit .211/.287/.376 in 2022 for a wRC+ of 95 and his offense slipped a bit farther in 2023. The A’s designated him for assignment in August of last year and the Guards put in a claim. Moving to Cleveland seemed to spur a bit of a bounceback, as Laureano slashed .243/.342/.382 for a wRC+ of 106 down the stretch. That apparently intrigued the Guards enough that they tendered him a contract, agreeing to the aforementioned $5.15M salary. But he has fallen off dramatically and now finds himself looking for his next opportunity. As mentioned, Laureano can be signed to a major league roster at essentially no cost. Perhaps some club would give him a spot and see if he can play well enough over the next two months to be flipped for a lottery ticket prospect. Or even if no club is willing to bite on that, he should at least be able to find a minor-league deal somewhere. This article first appeared on MLB Trade Rumors and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A severe thunderstorm warning was issued by the National Weather Service on Monday at 3:04 p.m. in effect until 3:30 p.m. for Oneida County. Residents should be prepared for wind gusts of up to 60 mph. \"At 3:04 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located over Floyd, or 7 miles east of Rome, moving northeast at 40 mph,\" states the weather service. \"Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.\" Locations impacted by the warning include Rome, Trenton, Floyd, Oriskany, Steuben, Remsen, Holland Patent, Prospect, Barneveld and Alder Creek. The weather service states, \"Remain alert for a possible tornado! Tornadoes can develop quickly from severe thunderstorms. If you spot a tornado go at once into the basement or small central room in a sturdy structure. For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.\" Each year, lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times, with the majority of these electrifying events occurring during the summer months. Unfortunately, lightning is responsible for claiming the lives of approximately 20 people annually, as reported by the weather service. The threat of lightning becomes more pronounced as thunderstorms draw nearer, peaking when the storm is directly overhead and gradually waning as it moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: 2. Indoors safety measures: 3. Wait for the all-clear: When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of rapid water flow: Maintain safe driving distances: Slow down and drive with care: Choose your lane wisely: Visibility matters: Watch out for slippery roads: Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Mind your windshield wipers: By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down.

        "content": "Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, tells LARA ADEJORO what the agency is doing regarding drug security, actions being taken against substandard products, among other issues How interesting or challenging has your job been since you assumed office in 2017? It has been a journey. First of all, I was away for 37 years, and I was able to function better, not because America is something special, but it is because the system allows you to think. Here, many factors can block the way you want to think to make things better. They call it the Nigerian factor, but I don’t call it the Nigerian factor; I call it stupidity. We don’t respect time. Time is money, and that is why we are poor, while other countries are rich. You have an appointment for 4pm, and you are coming at 6pm, and then you say let us pray. How? Let us pray to whom? Let us pray for what? God created the world in seven days, and that is a timeline, but we don’t keep to time. That is one challenging thing, but you know I give it to my staff in NAFDAC. I observe that they keep to time from the beginning, and the problem with time is with the larger society; not with the NAFDAC staff. Again, we don’t have respect for money at all. The way I was brought up is to have respect for money, to know that money does many good things if that money is respected, don’t worship money, I am not talking of worshiping money; it is knowing that with money, you can change many things if you respect money, you don’t let it fly away through corruption, you don’t let it fly away through negligence, you don’t let it fly away through bad leadership or bad governance. I find that widely challenging in the greater society. We don’t have a sense of responsibility and accountability. If you give me N10, I am supposed to account to you on how I spent the N10. I have sent people errands with N1,000 and they bought the product for N750, and they just walked away, I asked them for my balance because if I want to give it to you, I will give it to you; do not just walk away with my money. How did we get to this point? We don’t have a sense of accountability, and it has permeated the whole society – from the home, to the church, to the mosque, and to wherever we work, it is a problem. In terms of NAFDAC, the challenge is a lack of cohesion and team effort. You cannot work in a regulatory system and be an island, but a silo mentality destroys the civil service. People keep to what they know, they don’t like to share. In a regulatory system where approval of drugs is dependent on about five to six directorates, and you are now keeping it to yourself, I find that very challenging. Some people don’t know or don’t want to work together but we are changing that. I tell my staff to see this as we are one, whether we have 26 directorates or not, we are one. We are going towards the one goal to make sure that the medicine, food, or whatever that we approve are of quality, and one person cannot do that. We have a country where NAFDAC was removed from the ports for seven years, and our mandate is to control imports and exports. Then you removed NAFDAC. What was the consequence of removing NAFDAC from the ports? So, everybody started dumping everything they wanted. They tell themselves to go to Nigeria and there has been no gateman there for seven years, and we have not finished mopping the mess because of the cabal they have formed, and that is a big challenge. We replaced passion with money. You can have a project and if you think it is money first, that project is not going to be successful; that doesn’t mean that that project doesn’t need money, but you have to put passion, goals, objectives, and strategic plans in the project. Look at the project and ask yourself where you are going, and what your expectations are at the end of the time. Those are the key performance indicators. But it is money first for them, and it is a disease in the whole world. Nigeria has the highest number of uncompleted projects in Africa because before the money gets to the hand of the contractor, most of it is gone. What is also challenging is what I see as an oath of silence when bad things are happening. I was telling a friend the other day that we were ruled for almost 40 years by the military, and you could not criticise. People may die; so, people don’t talk maybe because of fear or maybe because things started degenerating at home. When children start controlling their parents, why wouldn’t they start abusing drugs? When parents cannot discipline a child, these are challenging things. However, when I see challenges, I see opportunities. We have had debt of over N3.2bn, and another N500m that they could not figure how, that’s a challenge. You cannot build a strong agency without money. How were you able to clear this debt? I saw that as an opportunity, and I said we were going to pay back, they said nobody pays back money in Nigeria, but I promised we would pay back, and everybody would know we paid back. For two or three years, I said we could save here to buy vehicles, we could save here for computers, I was making people think about how to respect money. The thinking was that if we saved this money, we could use it for good things. We have been doing that. We saved money to buy computers, equipment, and vehicles; these are not luxuries for us; they are tools. In one year, we paid back N3.2bn, people couldn’t believe it. People said NAFDAC had money and that we did not need support, but I argued that we didn’t have because we had to pay back the debt. What other challenging situation did you meet on the ground when you assumed office as the NAFDAC DG? Before my arrival, there was about N5bn that was evaded from the port; people who were supposed to pay, maybe they have given bribes and walked away. We started pursuing them and we were able to recover about N800m. Some of the companies had wrong addresses, our staff used motorcycle to get to some places they described as their addresses. Some of these places were not motorable, and they would find out that it was somewhere in the bush. That evaded payment has stopped because we digitalised our port inspection system. Another challenge is staff members are so talented but are just sitting down, not being challenged to go higher. For me, I don’t care where you are from, as long as you have something to contribute, something that is going to add value to our system. Of course, people are relocating abroad now, not because NAFDAC is not doing something but because the economy is not there yet. So, human capital is a challenge. Another challenge of course was computers not being available for directors, not a single director had a computer. Computers where I lived for decades are like paper that you have to use; it’s like pen, and yet a director didn’t have it. It is money that we respect that we use to buy computers. Another challenge was the laboratory; the equipment was uninstalled or badly installed, and nobody was paying attention. So, I knew we needed to buy equipment to test products. A challenge also was that we had a very bad image, even internationally. So, we started working on image-making, rebranding, and explaining. They were surprised that we stopped coming with sirens into their countries. That bad image has changed completely. When we go to meetings, they know that we are there, not because we are the last to enter but because of what we need to share and present. People know that you are joking when you go to just blow hot air, but that has changed. These days, as you are talking, people are already googling your name and the topic you are talking about. There is nothing hidden now. People now respect NAFDAC; we are leading in Africa, not because we are now on Maturity Level 3, but because in the comity of nations, we have something to share. Of course, ML3 is good, our laboratory is great, and we are working hard, and we have the information to share. Thank God I have staff members who are cooperating because they know we have a task to do. Recently, you banned alcohol in sachets, PET, and glass bottles of 200ml and below, but that raised concerns from labour unions, manufacturers, and even lawmakers who said you should lift the ban. What are you doing to strike a balance to ensure that the ban is not hurting businesses and the health of Nigerians is also safeguarded? Well, our mandate is to control the importation, exportation, manufacturing, advertisement, sale, and use of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals, and packaged water. In 2010, Nigeria with 193 countries signed that they would not make alcohol easily accessible to young people. But we don’t dare to stand by it. Why do we have children that have become alcoholics before they get to the university if they ever get to the university? Children are well disposed to substance abuse, and parents have to lock their doors because they don’t know what their children can do to them at night. We have children who are mentally ill because you will expose a child to alcohol at a young age. I am not against alcohol; I take occasional wine. They said why can’t children have identity cards, so they don’t sell to them. Where, in Nigeria? In a system that works, yes. In the United States, you cannot buy cigarettes, you will show your identity card because they will quote your identity on the computer, and it shows that it is genuine. Does that mean we will not get there? We will, but maybe in 50 years. We have children now who have cancer because their livers have been compromised, because of early alcohol use. We have young people having kidney problems. We are not robots with metals; we are human beings, we have organs, and when the organs start taking alcohol, they start breaking down with time. It was 2018, and they said their businesses would collapse, and we said we would give them five years to figure out how they would arrange their businesses. The reality is that there are still some people working at those companies, but the years given to them are suddenly not enough for them. We don’t think of the next generation, we think of the money we need immediately. Whether we kill somebody or not, we just need money immediately. In terms of the ban, it is a ministerial directive, and the minister is in charge of that now. So, it is between the executive and the legislature. The executive will determine the next line of action. It has also been observed that despite the ban, we still have people selling and buying these products. What are you doing to ensure that people adhere to the ban? Time will tell, let us just put it that way. What are you doing regarding drug security in the country? We were taught a lesson during the pandemic that we are naked as a country because we were addicted to importation. We have this colonial mentality that if it is not bought from outside, it is not good. It was not like that before. In terms of drug security, we have changed the paradigm, we are encouraging local manufacturing, and we are telling them that they can. Now, we have companies that are trying to manufacture the active ingredients. Before, the only thing we manufacture is water. We could not even manufacture starch to bind the things together but now, things are changing, because without a change in mindset, we will continue to have drug insecurity. We now have regulatory directives; if you have been importing or we have been giving you renewals, the last renewal will be the last. If you can make it in Nigeria, you must migrate to local manufacturing. If you can make it in Nigeria, and you don’t have money for a new company, you can partner with companies that are already doing the same thing that you are importing; that is drug security. We are encouraging our companies in terms of the quality of the medicines because it is not just having medicines; it is that they must be of quality because that is drug security. If you are making bad medicines as a local manufacturer, we will shut you down. Drug security is not just about making a lot of drugs in the country, it is about making a lot of drugs with quality, and that we have already established. If any company violates it, they will pay for it, either temporarily or permanently. We have shut some companies down permanently because it is better to have companies that will be sustained and will be in here for 10 or 20 years with quality maintained, and that is part of how we will ensure drug security. Then, decrease the imports, and increase local manufacturing based on international standards. Despite your efforts to regulate and control illicit drugs, and cosmetics, among others, Nigeria is still bedevilled by hawking of unregistered and illicit drugs, importation, sale, and use. How can this war be won in the country? First, it is not only NAFDAC that is responsible for the control of drugs. The Pharmacy Council of Nigeria is the one that gives licences to anywhere drug is being sold. Now, the two agencies are cooperating better; they control downstream, and we control both downstream and upstream. We control downstream because if anybody has illicit medicine, and we know, we can close that shop. So, there is more collaboration now between PCN and NAFDAC. That is part of why we are successful in Kano because we moved those who had been selling medicines openly in the market to a coordinated site where we can monitor them better. How can we win this war against illicit drugs and other counterfeit products? We are winning already. We cannot win overnight. First of all, substandard medicines are global. So, it is not just in Nigeria. It is all over; it is that it is higher in Africa than in other continents because we look forward to getting medicines from Asia, China, or India, whereas we are supposed to be thinking of making more medicines in our countries. So, winning the war is not a sprint, it is a marathon. We just want to make sure that we decrease as much as possible the prevalence of medicines that are bad in the country; we want to make sure that it goes down to less than five per cent. Right now, it is about 12 per cent which is still not good enough, but it is better than 17 per cent or 40 per cent. It used to be like 40 per cent years ago before my time, then they started decreasing it. Last year, you signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Health Insurance Authority on strengthening local drug manufacturing and ensuring quality and access to affordable drugs. How far has that partnership gone, especially now that the costs of medications keep skyrocketing? There are companies that we qualified based on their records that NHIA chose their drugs to be made available for Health Maintenance Organisations in their insurance scheme, and that is still there, but that will encourage more local manufacturing because the government will be patronising, which is part of the executive order that we should patronise our local manufacturers. So, the NHIA partnership is one of the examples where local manufacturers will continue to be patronised. The Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr Tunji Alausa, recently called for a ban on the importation of syringes. Does Nigeria have the capacity to produce the needed syringes, and don’t you think if we start producing the syringes here, it will be costlier? First of all, we can produce the syringes that we need in the country, but we need more producers of syringes. Whether we have 20 or five producers of syringes, they’ve got to be of quality. If they don’t have quality, we will not approve them because it is not only what we need in the country, but also what we can sell. If you think that it is just for us, then how do we improve our forex? How can we export if it is not of quality? We will continue to import; it is not 100 per cent dependent on the import that we are working against. If we have products that are of quality like syringes, they may be costly at a point, and the government doesn’t say you should not bring syringes, it is that the Customs must enforce the high tariff that has been placed on syringes. The government didn’t ban syringes from being imported, it is that they place such a customs duty very high to discourage it. That doesn’t mean they will not come in, but they want to discourage bringing it in because they know we can produce syringes. You earlier said over 70 per cent of Nigerian foods are rejected abroad. What could be the reasons for this? What type of foods are being rejected and what is the agency doing to ensure that the foods meet international standards? Silo mentality is what is killing us in Nigeria. One ministry does not want to work with another ministry, or one agency does not want to work with another agency; and corruption. Somebody is an exporter, and that person has been sold a lie that they will help them get what they have exported. They think other countries are as corrupt as we are. Ninety-five per cent, if not 99 or 100 per cent of products that are rejected never came to NAFDAC because of short cut. However, we are doing a lot; we have revised our expectation guidelines and regulations. We are more proactive now, and we work with agencies that are responsible for exportation to let them know that NAFDAC is there. We also sell ourselves short in this country. NAFDAC has the best set of laboratories in the whole of Nigeria, but some people will tell people not to go to NAFDAC. We have the best set of laboratories in the countries, but people will not come, and we even test free, but we have to also be more visible. People export without quality testing. Beans were banned before my time, but we are working hard as we speak to ensure that the ban is lifted. Once it is lifted, we export more; we get more forex, and we become better, and the Naira will appreciate. All these things are tied together but if it is myself and me alone mentality, it will be difficult to do, but we are working hard and reaching out to other agencies responsible for exports. Sesame seeds are another type that is rejected. However, we are having a series to sensitise our people not to burn their hard-earned money. Again, we are making sure that we become more vocal and more visible in terms of our roles as an agency in charge of exports of foods, drugs, and others. Since you assumed office, how many drug stores selling unregistered products, factories, and warehouses storing substandard products have been sealed or shut and how many persons carrying out dangerous activities have been arrested? Hundreds of people have been arrested. In terms of reported cases, the number is about 4,000. The number of cases concluded is about 922, and the number of cases pending is about 3,000 because of our court system. We have carried out over 2,000 surveillance activities. The number of samples from arrests is about 15,100. We also carry out destruction exercises, which are part of the enforcement activities. We have done about 20; we have carried out over 15,100 interrogations. We have arrested hundreds of hawkers. The most important thing to know is that NAFDAC is working; we are doing what we are supposed to do, even though we have very little staff. We are supposed to have about 12,000 staff members, but we have only 2,000. It is the staff members who do the enforcement, inspection, and surveillance, but despite that, we are still working very hard, and it is showing in our results. Incidents of substandard medicines are going down, and the number of new manufacturing companies going up. The war against fake drugs can be dangerous. Do you receive threats and how do you protect your staff? NAFDAC staff member has been attacked physically before; one of our staff’s daughters was kidnapped but mercifully, she escaped. We have received death threats, but this is what the country needs to hear when we talk of hazards and compensate us. Our staff members are not very well paid despite all these hazards, and exposure. But we are moving on. In Africa, we are the biggest, and we let our ports become a haven for criminals for seven years, and it is not like that in most countries in Africa, because they cannot remove regulatory agencies from the ports, but it happened in Nigeria, and we are still trying to mop up the mess that that left.",

        "description": "Former South African President Jacob Zuma is the wild card in Wednesday’s election for Africa’s most advanced country. He leads a new political party that's draining support from the ruling African National Congress that he once said would rule until...",
        "content": "DURBAN, South Africa (AP) — The 59-year-old Dumisani Ndlovu has voted in every South Africa national election since he and the rest of the Black majority finally won the right 30 years ago. He has faithfully supported the liberation party-turned-ruling party African National Congress every time. That ends on Wednesday. In a way, nostalgia is calling. Ndlovu in this week's election is turning his support to the man, Jacob Zuma , whose career spanned from the liberation struggle to the presidency before falling out with his ANC colleagues and reemerging last year with a new political party . That MK party, named after the ANC's old armed wing, shows how the 82-year-old Zuma is leveraging the past to rally South Africans' support against the ANC, which he himself once claimed would rule until “Jesus comes back.” Here in the heartland of Zuma supporters, the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, cab driver Ndlovu has embraced the unlikely comeback of a political survivor after years of corruption allegations, criminal charges and prison. Even being barred from this election as a candidate for Parliament over a recent conviction hasn't blunted Zuma's influence. “They think they have finished him, but we are with him all the way. The ANC will pay,” Ndlovu said. It is a rallying cry that could, for the first time, force the ANC into a coalition to stay in power. The new party is fielding other candidates for Parliament and appears likely to win seats. Zuma has become the wild card of the election for Africa's most advanced country, six years after resigning South Africa's presidency under a cloud. His MK party was formed just over six months ago and yet is expected to drain significant support from the ANC, which already faced its sternest test. Zuma's credentials — he was in prison alongside Nelson Mandela for his work in the anti-apartheid movement — resonate especially in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Ndlovu, the cab driver, had backed the ANC since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule in 1994. Now, one of his grievances against the ANC is what he calls its ill-treatment of Zuma. “He went to jail during apartheid and then they (the ANC) put him in jail again despite all his sacrifices. What kind of freedom is that?” Ndlovu said. Zuma was sent to prison in 2021 after refusing to testify at an inquiry looking into alleged corruption in government during the time he was president from 2009-2018. He called that sentence an effort by the ANC to silence him. Zuma said last week's Constitutional Court decision to disqualify him from standing as a candidate was part of a grudge against him by the ruling party and the courts. The constitution doesn't allow anyone to stand for election if they have been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison without the option of a fine. “I am going to fight for my rights until this country agrees that freedom must be a complete freedom, not for some and oppression for others,” Zuma said. He now fights under the banner of the MK, which he has fashioned as the vanguard of anti-apartheid struggle ideals such as the distribution of land to Black people. The party’s symbol is similar to the old ANC military wing’s logo. Its full name is uMkhonto weSizwe, which means Spear of the Nation. The ANC took MK to court over its use of the name, which it claims it owns. MK won. It was another example of the ANC trying to silence him, Zuma said. Zuma's new party also looks to the future, promising jobs, free education and better healthcare for young people who make up the majority of the country’s population. They have no memory of apartheid, but they have plenty of grievances about the deep inequality that remains. Zuma claims to be a truer version of the ANC and more dedicated to helping South Africa’s poor Black majority. His party's branding has been welcomed by supporters for its anti-apartheid nostalgia. “I have known uMkhonto all my life. It fought for freedom. It is there for us again this time,” Ndlovu said. How such loyalty — and the ANC's irritation over it — might translate into votes will be seen on Wednesday. “It might just make people want them (MK) more because the question that arises is, why put so much push against this party? There must be there something, and I think people are intrigued and they might just go out and vote for them,” Sanet Madonsela-Solomon, a lecturer in the department of political sciences at the University of South Africa, told TV station eNCA this week. At MK's last major campaign rally over the weekend in KwaZulu-Natal, gray-haired men and women in military fatigues joined youthful supporters sporting skinny jeans and manicured nails. Together, they danced to old anti-apartheid struggle songs that evoked the hardships of that period. They praised late ANC icons like Mandela and criticized current ANC leaders. “uMkhonto is not for the people of KwaZulu-Natal only, it is a calling for South Africa as whole,\" said one attendee, Siboniso Gwala. “The spear is what will liberate this country. uMkhonto will liberate Black people.” His 6-year-old son, Nkanyezi, was in tow, singing along and wearing a beret with MK’s symbol — a warrior with a spear and shield.

Among the hundreds of companies participating last week in the SusHi-Tech innovation exhibition in Tokyo, the Israeli delegation, organized by the commercial attaches of the Economy Ministry of Japan in collaboration with SivanS Group, stood out. 1 View gallery The cultured eel that intrigues the Japanese ( Photo: Anatoly Michaello ) Eleven Israeli companies and ForSea, which develops cultured eel using innovative technology that allows for the economical cultivation of seafood, garnered significant attention. The eel market in Japan rolls over $4.5 billion annually and is steadily growing. The high demand naturally leads to a decline in the natural eel population, even to the point of severe endangerment.

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "description": "Dr Ana Jeelani, from Didsbury, was sent to save children in Palestine",
        "content": "A surgeon who flew out to Gaza to save children caught up in the conflict says she didn’t write a will before she went – she only cared about who would get her match ticket if she didn’t return home. Dr Ana Jeelani, a consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon at Alder Hey Hospital, took on a two-week volunteer placement at Al-Aqsa hospital back in March. The 38-year-old, from Didsbury , kept the trip a secret right until she left in fear her loved ones would try and stop her from going. Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link And while the surgeon didn’t organise a will ahead of heading into the warzone, she did make arrangements for one thing – her sought-after Liverpool FC ticket. The avid fan says she wanted to ensure her ticket to see Liverpool play Wolverhampton at Anfield on Sunday (May 19) in Jürgen Klopp’s final match as manager. “People asked me if I had made a will,” she said. “The only thing I made provisions for in case I didn’t come back was my ticket to Jurgen Klopp’s final match at Anfield. I got it for about £47 in the ballot but then it was worth something like £20,000. Dr Ana Jeelani in Gaza “Only one person has access to my account apart from me – I told him ‘If I die, my ticket can’t be sold,’ and I gave him a list of true supporters who could take it. “Beyond that, I didn’t really think about whether or not I might come back from Gaza. You just don’t know – there’s no pattern to this conflict. I just thought, if my time’s come, my time’s come. I’ve done something worthwhile, and equally you could die being hit by a bus in Didsbury. “If you’re going to go, you might as well do something you’d be proud of. Wherever you stand on the conflict, 15,000 children are dead and we’re children’s doctors. We can’t ignore that.” Ana says she didn’t tell her family she was leaving right until she was set to depart – her parents begging her not to go in fear she wouldn’t come home. “I only told my parents I was going shortly before I left,” she said. “In fact, I got my sister to tell them. “They pleaded with me not to go. My mum rang me in floods of tears saying, ‘Don’t go, why are you doing this to us?’ “But they also knew that I had the resolve and I was going to go. They were frantic with worry, but they’re also very proud.” Ana Jeelani (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) Ana says she witnessed the atrocities of what was happening in Gaza in the media and wanted to help in any way she could. Ahead of flying out with MAP, Medical Air for Palestinians, she underwent two days of security training in Egypt, learning skills including what to do if she were taken hostage and how to escape under rubble. “The hospital was chaotic,” she said. “There were 166 beds and around 800 inpatients. Families would tend to their injured, basically living in the hospital, some would bring in stoves to cook food, and all this is in the ward or the corridor, all mixed up together. “There’s no nutrition, no specialised mattresses for pressure wounds, some of the beds don’t even have mattresses. The wounds are contaminated and most of the wounds become infected.” Ana says the lights would randomly go out in the middle of operating – forcing them to use head torches they carried in their pockets. The trauma she witnessed left Ana suffering from insomnia for two weeks upon her return to the UK. “Alder Hey were really supportive of me going,” she added. “Giving me humanitarian leave to go and arranging counselling when I got back. I had very bad insomnia for about two weeks afterwards but what has really helped, as well as the counselling, is staying in touch with the team. “We had such a good team and all get on really well. We speak most days on WhatsApp. It really helps to speak to others who have been through the same thing, who have that shared experience.” Ana has suffered from poor mental health since returning home (Image: Dr Ana Jeelani) But among the horrors she saw, Ana says there were moments of joy, from waking to the sound of children laughing to the first time she was able to wash her hair. \"There were always moments of simple joy to be had. We felt like a proper family. I never felt homesick. I have left my heart there. I don’t think I can ever fully mentally recover from it until the situation is over.’ “The children are brilliant – there was this little kid who would follow me around in his wheelchair and say that the fact that I didn’t give him any money was a humanitarian issue – he didn’t know what it meant - it was just something he’d learnt. “He was so cute. His family had been killed and he was being looked after by the people in the next beds to him. They all look after each other. “And then there was a Ziko – a child of about 11 who hung around A&E and would help out when there were mass casualties, passing plaster and dunking it. “He kind of found us and latched on to us so we made him some little scrubs. He was such a good kid but seeing things he shouldn’t be seeing. We don’t know much about him – he lived in a tent and was always hanging around the hospital. “When we left, we gave them everything. We gave them our suitcases, our shoes, some gave their phones. We arrived with 52 suitcases in as a team of seven full of supplies, we left with one each. Anything we had on us, we gave.” Ana says there was no fresh food during her time in Gaza, with all produce arriving into the city going rotten before it had the chance to sell. “I heard about a colleague’s wife who queued for half an hour and paid $35 for six eggs,” she said. “When she cracked them open, they were all rotten. They’re living on canned food.” The surgeon says there’s one thing she noticed that doesn’t come across in the media – the hope that the conflict will soon come to an end. “The resilience that the Palestinian people have,” she said. “They just want to get on with their lives. It’s a beautiful place, people are so loving and lovely. “When we were leaving, a guy said that even if we hadn’t operated on a single patient, the fact that we came here and let them know that they’re not alone means more than anything. “Everything on social media depicts the horrors, but it doesn’t depict the heart.”",

        "description": "Scott Watter, a staffer in McMaster's psychology, neuroscience and behaviour department, has been 'removed' due to a 'breach of trust,' the Ontario university has said.",
        "content": "A McMaster University professor in Hamilton, Ont., acquitted of sexual assault in 2022, has lost his job with the post secondary institution. Scott Watter, who taught in the psychology, neuroscience and behaviour (PNB) department, has been “removed” from the university’s faculty, according to two McMaster executives. The institution’s president David Farrar and board chair Jane Allen in a joint statement insisted that Watter “abused” his position as a faculty member and that his conduct and pattern of behavior involving multiple students was a “breach of trust.” Farrar and Allen explained the board’s executive and governance committee decided on dismissal after receiving a recommendation from a three-member senate committee determining “there was adequate cause for his removal.” “That committee found Dr. Watter’s conduct to be unethical, inappropriate and in some instances exploitative,” the joint statement said. Story continues below advertisement “In engaging in sexual relations with a number of students, one of whom was in a vulnerable position and relying on him for support, the Hearing Committee found that Dr. Watter abused the responsibilities and authority of his position as a faculty member.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. Watter was charged by Hamilton police in June 2020 after a woman came forward with accusations of sexual assault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. The university would then reveal its own probe a month later after receiving more complaints and subsequent suspension of several faculty members, including Watter.

Watter, then-46-years-old, appeared in front of a justice in August 2021 and registered a not-guilty plea. The accuser, a former student never identified due to a publication ban, took the stand in the 2022 judge-only trial and insisted she was repeatedly assaulted without consent over several months in 2017. In December 2022, Justice Amanda Camara acquitted Watter saying the Crown failed to prove that he misused his position to persuade the student’s consent. She also rejected the accuser’s testimony saying inconsistencies in her story never proved there wasn’t consent to sexual activity. Story continues below advertisement McMaster’s executive and governance committee revealed that Watters did object to “the process and procedures” of their “removal proceedings” in mid-May. “The approach taken by the Hearing Committee was not procedurally fair, and resulted in a flawed conclusion based on a hearing that lacked the foundation of adequate particulars,” council for Watters said in a complaint. The hearing committee dismissed the submission insisting there was no proof of any “procedural error.” Related News McMaster University prof accused of sexual assault pleads ‘not guilty’",

        "content": "TORONTO — The University of Toronto turned to the courts Monday in an effort to clear an encampment of pro-Palestinian protesters from its downtown campus, as a Quebec judge imposed restrictions on a similar demonstration at the Université du Québec à Montréal. At the Toronto encampment, protesters said they were prepared to fight back with their own legal team and refused to leave the site, ignoring a deadline set in a trespass notice that had been issued last week. U of T president Meric Gertler said the school was seeking an injunction and asking a court for an expedited case conference. \"In addition to pursuing this legal avenue to return King’s College Circle to the university community, we continue to engage in discussions with students representing those in the encampment,\" he wrote in a statement early Monday. \"We held a long and productive meeting yesterday and are meeting again today. We remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement and bring the unauthorized encampment to an end.\" University officials had issued a trespass notice on Friday ordering demonstrators to remove the encampment by 8 a.m. Monday, and on Sunday officials indicated they would seek an injunction in court if protesters didn't comply. The protesters, who set up tents in a large green space at the heart of the university's downtown campus on May 2, were joined by faculty and labour groups for a rally outside the nearby Convocation Hall as the trespass deadline passed. Demonstrators held up flags and huddled under umbrellas as a drizzle turned to heavier rain during the rally. Sara Rasikh, one of the spokespeople for the encampment, told the crowd that protesters tried for months to get the university to listen to their demands, but only received acknowledgment after setting up the encampment. \"The reason for this is because the people's strength is threatening to them. It is threatening to the legitimacy of this institution,\" she said. \"U of T continues to propose committees but we want commitments. We want divestment. We want disclosure. And we want it now.\" On Sunday, Rasikh had said the group had its own team of lawyers prepared to respond to an application from the university for an injunction. \"The fact that (university administrators) want the police to come in and clear us out after they told us that they want to end things peacefully, it just doesn't make sense,\" she said. \"It does not change the fact that we will continue to remain steadfast in our demands.” Demonstrators and university administrators met Sunday afternoon, during which protesters presented what they described as a counter-offer calling on the school to disclose public investments in companies profiting from Israel's offensive in Gaza. They're also asking the school to establish and let them be part of a joint working group examining private investments, as well as cut ties with two specific Israeli academic institutions. On Thursday last week, the university had made an offer to the protesters – with 24 hours to respond – that said the school would form a working group to consider options for the disclosure of the school's investments, but it would not end any partnerships with Israeli universities. On divestment, the university said it would strike an advisory committee to review the students' request under existing school policies. Natalie Rothman, a history professor at the university and a member of the Jewish Faculty Network, said she was \"outraged\" when the school issued the trespass notice. \"This is a peaceful protest. We've been here from day one, it's been nothing but a model of what the university should be like in terms of real learning, real solidarity, real community,\" Rothman said at Monday's rally. \"And the fact that the university would threaten students and staff and faculty with disciplinary actions for a peaceful protest in accordance with our Charter rights, with the university's own mission statement, is absolutely outrageous.\" Ontario Minister of Colleges and Universities Jill Dunlop said Monday she supported clearing the encampment at the University of Toronto. \"We want to ensure this is cleaned up and dealt with right away,\" Dunlop said. \"Convocation is coming up and this is a safety issue. We want to ensure that families feel safe going on campus and not intimidated to attend the services.\" Other universities have also taken legal action to end pro-Palestinian protest encampments that have cropped up on their campuses. On Monday, a Quebec court granted the Université du Québec à Montréal a partial injunction against protesters who set up an encampment on its downtown campus earlier this month. Superior Court Justice Louis J. Gouin ruled safety measures need to be put in place at the site, including prohibiting protesters from setting up tents and other material within two metres of campus buildings and ensuring doors, windows and walls are clear of obstructions. The judge said the measures won't infringe on the encampment members' right to protest. Separately, two judges denied provisional injunction requests to dismantle an encampment set up in late April at McGill University. McGill is now seeking an interlocutory injunction, which focuses less on urgency and more on legal rights at the heart of the dispute. Meanwhile, protesters at McMaster University in Hamilton decided to put an end to their encampment after reaching a deal with the university last week. A statement issued by the group does not specify the terms of the agreement, but called it a \"significant step forward\" even though its demands were not all met.

        "content": "The newly elected President of the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Nigeria, Akintoye Adeoye, has promised to provide access to housing reports. He disclosed this at the association’s investiture ceremony in Lagos, recently. He said, “REDAN will provide members with exclusive access to market intelligence reports, data analytics, and research insights. “We will establish an accelerator and incubator programme to support real estate technology startups (prop-tech) and entrepreneurs in the built environment, offering mentoring, funding opportunities, and resources such as office space and legal support.” Adeoye assured that the association would establish governance in the real estate sector. He said, “REDAN will take a leadership role in creating regulatory frameworks and governance for the real estate industry. We will advocate for the recapitalisation of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria to facilitate affordable housing. “Promoting ESG frameworks, sustainable practices, and regulatory compliance will position our members for long-term success. “We will focus on inclusivity, carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste management, water usage, and biodiversity conservation. Building capacity for green building practices will be a priority, offering resources, training, and incentives for adopting environmentally friendly construction methods and technologies.” Meanwhile, Prof. Fabian Ajogwu of Kenna Partners has called for transparency in the real estate sector. He said, “The critical issue stemming from challenges in the sector is a lack of transparency. The lack of transparency in land tenure systems, and land transactions makes it difficult in some states in Nigeria to ascertain a property’s true ownership and history, discouraging investment and weakening growth in the real estate sector. “Corruption also contributes to the lack of transparency in real estate transactions in Nigeria. It is a critical problem that runs through every level of the country’s government. This includes practices such as bribery, extortion, contract fraud, market distortion, which results in misallocation of resources, and embezzlement.”",

        "content": "The Ulsterman notched up his 25th win at the 2023 event , putting him one away from the all-time record of 26 set by his late uncle Joey Dunlop, which has stood since 2000 as the benchmark. He led the timesheets outright with a 129.59mph lap aboard his Hawk Racing-run Honda Superbike and headed Davey Todd, embarking on his first TT as a BMW rider following a switch from Padgetts Racing to TAS Racing for 2024. Outright lap record holder Peter Hickman completed the top three overall on his Superstock BMW run by FHO Racing. The opening day of practice had been delayed due to the 37.75-mile being hit by rain overnight, with roads not closing until 2pm for the untimed practices in the afternoon. The first timed qualifying of TT 2024 got underway at just after 6pm local time, with the first laps being set by the Supersport and Supertwin class. Todd led the way in the Supersport class after putting in two laps on his V2 Ducati Panigale, with his best effort a 125.601mph. That put him ahead of James Hillier, who has reunited with Bournemouth Kawasaki in the Supersport class, on a 125.483mph lap. Michael Dunlop completed the top three in class on his MD Racing-run Triumph 675. Dunlop, who won both Supersport races at TT 2023, switches from Honda machinery for 2024 for those contests. In Supertwin, Hickman led the way with a118.011mph lap aboard his Swan-liveried Yamaha R7, on which he was able to win at the North West 200 earlier this month having also won in class at the TT in 2023. He completed just one lap on his Supertwin and Triumph Supersport bike, with Todd second on his Dafabet Racing Kawasaki. Dunlop didn’t set a time on his Paton, and appeared to have some issues with it in the untimed session earlier in the day. Dunlop had no such issues on his Honda Fireblade in the Superbike class that concluded the solo running on Monday, with Todd and Hickman completing the top three. John McGuinness was fourth on the works Honda in class ahead of team-mate Dean Harrison. After apparent logistical and supply issues led to Harrison – who has switch to Honda from DAO Racing Kawasaki for 2024 – and McGuinness only having their Superstock bikes available at the North West 200, Honda has a full compliment of machinery at the TT. Hickman led the Superstock class at 129.032mph from Dunlop and Dominic Herbertson. The Sidecar class concluded Monday’s practice action, with the Ryan Crowe/Callum Crowe outfit leading the way with a best lap of 116.699mph. The headlines were stolen by outright Sidecar TT lap record holder and 14-time winner Ben Birchall, as he kicked off his 2024 TT campaign with a new passenger. Kevin Rousseau takes over from Ben’s brother Tom Birchall, who announced his retirement from the TT earlier this year . Birchall/Rousseau went second fastest on their second flying lap at 115.882mph, while Peter Founds and Jevan Walmsley completed the top three.",

        "description": "Murdered by Hamas terrorists along with a busload of fellow travelers in Sderot on October 7The post Valeri Fridman, 60: Grandfather who was ‘the funniest person ever’ appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Valeri Fridman, 60, of Dimona, was murdered by Hamas terrorists in Sderot on October 7. Valeri was one of 13 people taking part in an organized trip for older Israelis, mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Union, to the Dead Sea that morning, when their minibus got a flat tire near Sderot and stopped next to a bus stop in the city to try and fix it. While the group was standing there, rocket sirens rang out, and the bus stop bomb shelter — which was supposed to automatically open during a siren — remained electronically locked. Moments later, a pick-up truck of terrorists drove by and shot dead all 13 travelers. Only the driver emerged alive. Images of the group of pensioners lying dead at the bus stop were among the first to circulate on the morning of the Hamas onslaught, shocking Israelis and the world with the brutality of the assault. Valeri was buried in Dimona on October 12. He is survived by his three sons, Gadi, Alon and Steve, and two grandchildren. The Dimona municipality said he worked in a factory in Sderot. Family and friends remembered Valeri as a devoted fan of Maccabi Tel Aviv and a dedicated family man, who came to Israel 30 years ago from the former Soviet Union to establish a life in Israel. A family friend, Galit Glikin, eulogized Valeri on Facebook as “the person with the most golden heart. My father’s closest friend, and an uncle to us from a young age when I still lived in Dimona. A beloved man, with a huge heart.” Steve, Valeri’s son, visited the site where his father and so many others were gunned down, a month after the attack, and told Channel 12 news that the family “still haven’t accepted that this happened — we feel that Dad is coming home any minute.” Valeri’s son, Alon, told Ynet that his father was looking forward to the day trip to the Dead Sea, “to disconnect a little bit from work.” “Dad was probably the funniest person ever,” said Alon. “He got along with everyone and he had a big heart, we never saw him argue or fight with anyone, or say ‘no’ to anybody who asked him for anything. He was a special guy, he was always there for his grandchildren and for everyone.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "Georgie Palmer reacts to being kicked off flight over daughter's nut allergy A BBC weather presenter whose family was kicked off a flight has said the ordeal was \"humiliating\". Georgie Palmer, 49, her husband Nick Sollom, 48, and daughters Rosie, 12, and Annie, 14, were ordered off the plane after they told the crew Rosie was allergic to peanuts. Staff on the flight from Gatwick Airport to Dalaman in Turkey refused to make an announcement to tell passengers not to eat peanuts, according to Ms Palmer. The forecaster said she gently asked fellow passengers sitting around her not to eat peanuts and to pass the message on. But Ms Palmer claimed the \"angry\" captain of the jet insisted they get off the plane before it would take off. She told Good Morning Britain the experience was \"absolutely humiliating\" for her daughter. Ms Palmer added: \"When he (the captain) found out I had spoken to the other passengers he was screaming at me from the cockpit. He was so angry. READ MORE Tourists told to hide valuables in unusual item to avoid being robbed on holiday Georgie Palmer tells GMB it was 'absolutely humiliating and desperate' for her daughter (Image: Good Morning Britain) \"The next thing I knew we were told to get off the plane. It is really beautiful how every passenger on that plane was so wonderful, but nobody working on that plane showed one ounce of compassion.\" Ms Palmer added: \"Rosie is in a terrible state about this. It has ruined her holiday. We don't go away all the time. We maybe fly once a year and have never had problems with other airlines. \"If we had known that policy, we would never have booked with them. We have been through the website with a fine-tooth comb and there is nothing.\" She said there was no way to inform the airline beforehand and wondered how many people with peanut allergies would fly on SunExpress this summer not knowing the policy.

Read our Privacy Policy Ms Palmer said even if her daughter didn't come into direct contact with a peanut, if someone ate one on board, then she could die. The presenter said three days after what happened the family still hadn't heard from SunExpress and the family's insurance says the captain has the discretion to remove people for no reason. A spokesman for SunExpress said: \"We take the safety of our passengers very seriously. Shortly after boarding our flight from London Gatwick, the passenger raised a concern about one of his family group having a serious peanut allergy and requested an announcement to other passengers. \"We refrain from making these kinds of announcements as, like many other airlines, we cannot guarantee an allergen-free environment on our flights, nor prevent other passengers from bringing food items containing allergens on board.\" The spokesman said due to the \"insistent behaviour\" of the passenger to others on board that they should not consume nuts, the captain decided it would be safest if the family did not travel on the flight. Trending The family was told to get off the plane at London Gatwick (Image: Getty) He added: \"When this was explained to the passenger, he did exhibit aggressive behaviour towards our crew members and tried to gain access to the cockpit. \"To ensure the safety of our crew and our passengers on board, we cannot tolerate aggressive and unruly behaviour on our flights. \"Additionally, our website states passengers must notify us 48 hours in advance of any special care required due to a medical condition and no such notification was received from the passengers in this instance.\" The spokesman said the airline is fully aware this was an upsetting situation for the family and is taking the incident as an opportunity to conduct a review of the information provided during the booking process to ensure \"more effective solutions\" for passengers with allergies. Mr Sollom denied behaving aggressively, but admitted to feeling irked by the decision. He said he knocked on the cockpit door in a bid to speak to the captain after being told the family's bags were being removed from the plane.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: An international team of scientists from Finland, Canada, the US, and New Zealand has discovered a specific brain network hub that plays a key role in stuttering, an advance that can lead to new treatment options. The research, published in the Brain journal, examines two different types of stuttering — developmental and acquired. While both types are traditionally known to be separate, the study showed that besides “similarities at the behavioural level, there are also similarities at the neural level”. “Stuttering affects approximately 1 per cent of adults and can result in significant communication problems and social anxiety, yet the cause of stuttering is still unknown,” said lead author Catherine Theys, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. The professor said that while stuttering is a developmental disorder, it can also be caused by focal brain damage after a stroke or other neurological conditions. For the study, the team used two datasets and lesion network mapping to test whether lesions causing acquired stuttering map to a common brain network. They also used a third dataset to test whether this lesion-based network was relevant to developmental stuttering. Analysing each dataset, the team located a common stuttering network — a specific part of the left putamen, which is responsible for lip and face movements and timing and sequencing of speech. They also identified two additional areas of interest for speech imaging and stuttering research — the claustrum and amygdalostriatal transition area. “These are tiny areas of the brain — only a few mm wide — which is why they may typically not have been identified in previous studies. This shows a plausible network for stuttering,” they said, adding that the findings have relevance for treatment.",

The police SUV was parked on a slope when it suddenly began rolling down in India’s Madhya Pradesh and rammed into a sanitation work cleaning the road, an Indian media outlet reported. The viral video, doing rounds on social media, showed the police vehicle hitting a wall before ramming into the sanitation worker who suffered several injuries. While the police car was driverless, a police official was seen in the viral video sitting next to the driver seat. The cop was seen exiting the car and rushing in to help the injured worker. Following the incident, the man’s co-workers rushed to the scene and moved him to the hospital. Reports said that man took injuries to his head and had scratches on his hands, legs, and abdomen. Two police officials were suspended for carelessness following the incident. Later, reports said that the two cops had recently returned from a training programme and were enjoying a meal at a hotel in area. Police launched investigation into the matter after the suspension of the two policemen.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils have thrown caution to the wind for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. In Monday's event, dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way. Acuña remained down for several minutes while being treated, pointing at his left leg before walking off under his own power. The Braves’ initial diagnosis was left knee soreness. But the team announced later that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. ‘Furiosa’ sneaks past ‘Garfield’ to claim No. 1 spot over Memorial Day holiday weekend Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “The Garfield Movie,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. This weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades and the gap may only get bigger. Heat-related monkey deaths climb in Mexico, as environmentalists report deaths of birds and bats MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. And an animal park confirmed around a hundred parrots, toucans, bats and more have died apparently of dehydration in northen Mexico. Last week, environmentalists reported 138 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco. The Environment Department reported that number had risen, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. A wildlife biologist said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released.

        "content": "In her May 27 , Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili called for “full mobilization” of Georgians living abroad for the October parliamentary elections, a crucial vote that she recently dubbed a “referendum” on the country’s future. “Our future is in your hands, your vote will be very important, and I am waiting for you in Georgia or in the country where you live to show us, to tell us what kind of future you want for Georgia,” Zurabishvili told “over a million” of Georgian emigrants. According to the President, her address comes on a “Diaspora Day” which, contrary to custom and for reasons unknown to her, was not marked this year. Referring to the vision for the upcoming elections [Georgian Charter] that during the Independence Day celebrations on May 26, the President said that the diaspora is of “great importance” in the “plan.” “When the [foreign policy] course, the orientation, the future of our country is at stake: will it be a European country in close, tight relations with our partners or an isolated, some kind of Neo-Russian country – your role and your involvement in this decision is very important,” Zurabishvili said. Over the past few months, the President, along with opposition parties and civil society organizations, for a more active engagement of the diaspora in the October elections, where the votes of Georgians living abroad could be decisive. However, calls for the Georgian government to do more to facilitate the exercise of voting rights for Georgian emigres have largely gone unanswered.",

        "description": "Police say spectacles found near military barracks hours after soldier snatched them during tour of first premier's desert abode; pilferer interrogated, put on remandThe post Ben-Gurion’s stolen glasses returned to Sde Boker museum appeared first on The Times of Israel.",
        "content": "Glasses belonging to David Ben-Gurion were returned on Sunday to the founding prime minister’s hut-turned-commemorative museum in the southern kibbutz of Sde Boker, after a soldier stole them during a tour of the site, police said. The spectacles, which hold “historical and national significance,” were found near a military barracks in southern Israel, where the soldier who filched them had apparently tucked them away, police said in a statement. The soldier was put on remand after police investigated him, according to the statement. Gil Schneider, the museum’s manager, told Kan public radio that a staff member had alerted her Sunday morning that the glasses were missing. “First we had to check, maybe someone took them for treatment, because the items here are treated individually,” said Schneider of the museum’s copious collection, which includes Ben-Gurion’s 5,000-book library. Perusing hours of security camera footage, Schneider said, she discovered that a person in uniform — apparently a soldier — had seized a moment when his tour guide was not looking to cross the ropes cordoning off the exhibit and slip the glasses into his pocket. Soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces are often made to participate in “Culture Sunday” trips, during which they are taken to national landmarks before returning to their bases after weekends at home. It was unclear whether Ben-Gurion’s glasses were pilfered during such a tour. The museum lodged an online complaint to the police, which the Dimona police station responded to within less than an hour, Schneider said. Later that evening, police informed her that the glasses had been located, and would be returned the following day. Ben-Gurion, who as head of the Jewish Agency assumed the office of prime minister after proclaiming the founding of Israel in 1948, moved with his wife Paula to the Negev Desert’s Kibbuz Sde Boker after resigning the premiership five years later (he returned in 1955 for another eight-year stint). In moving south, the founding father famously called on Israel to “make the desert bloom” and tap into the unrealized potential of the Negev, which made up about two-thirds of the new state’s territory. Upon his death in 1973, Ben-Gurion’s hut was turned into a museum in his memory. Sde Boker also houses the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, which develop methods for food production in arid areas, and are affiliated with the Beersheba university that carries Ben-Gurion’s name.",

The UN human rights chief voiced “horror” at the Israeli air strike that killed 45 people in a displacement camp in Rafah and demanded “accountability”. “The images from the camp are horrific and point to no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths,” Volker Turk said in a statement, also calling on Palestinian armed groups to stop firing rockets and to “unconditionally release all hostages at once”.",

        "content": "PORT HARCOURT – The Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has donated 100 pieces of five seater wooden desks to the Community Secondary School, Rumuekini in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. Handing over the desks following a brief ceremony, the Rivers State representative on the Board of the NDDC, Chief Tony Okocha, said the gesture was in line with the mandate of the commission in improving the lives of the people. Daily Independent learnt that students of the benefiting school before NDDC intervention, took their classes sitting on bare floor or makeshift chairs. Okocha said, he was moved to intervene after he saw students of the school learning while sitting on the floor when he visited the school for on the spot assessment. He said after his visit, he drew the attention of the NDDC headed by Mr. Chiedu Ebie as the Chairman and Dr Samuel Ogbuku as the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, adding that prompt action was taken afterwards to salvage the situation. He said, “I visited the school one morning without anyone’s knowledge and saw students sitting in an uncomfortable environment and I was imagining how they could comprehend what the teacher was teaching under such conditions. “I also discovered that if it rains, the students will be in trouble because there are no windows in the school building. I swiftly drew the attention of the NDDC Board to the plight of those students and hence these desks.” He further stated, “Each of the desks can comfortably accommodate 5 to 7 students, which means that at the minimum, we have taken about 500 to 700 students off the ground.” Chief Okocha also used the occasion to appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the Federal Government and keep to continue supporting President Bola Tinubu, assuring that the NDDC will look into other infrastructural needs of the school. Chairman of the Rumuekini Community Development Committee, CDC, Gentle Akani, who spoke on behalf of the community, thanked the NDDC, especially Chief Tony Okocha for the intervention Akani, also begged the NDDC to continue to do more for the school and his entire community. Some students who expressed their happiness over the donations, thanked Chief Tony Okocha and the leadership of the Commission for alleviating their sufferings. “We thank the NDDC for coming to our aide. Before now, we didn’t have desk to sit, so used to sit on the floor to learn and write. The teachers are complaining because our learning board is so bad. So, we feel so excited with the provision of these desks today by the NDDC. “We pray God to bless everyone that made this to happen today.”",

        "content": "Canada announced on Monday that it will grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for relatives of Canadian living in the war-torn Palestinian enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the Canadian immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,” Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister had previously said that leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program’s efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, he added. There was no immediate comment from Israel or Egypt regarding Canada’s announcement. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and that 41 have arrived in Canada so far. The temporary visas are valid for three years after entering the country, according to the Canadian government website. The war in Gaza erupted after Hamas’s October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages, mostly civilians, amid acts of brutality and sexual assault. Vowing to destroy Hamas’s military and governance capabilities in Gaza and bring the hostages home, Israel launched a wide-scale operation in the Strip which is ongoing. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 35,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though only some 24,000 fatalities have been identified at hospitals. The tolls, which cannot be verified, include some 15,000 terror operatives Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. An estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. A total of 288 IDF soldiers have been killed during the ground offensive against Hamas and during operations along the Gaza border, as well as a acivilian Defense Ministry contractor.",

CCTV footage showed four persons abandoning the body at the spot. Karnataka police said it appeared that Madhu had been attacked by broken beer bottles and a rock. No complaint has been lodged with the Jeedimetla police yet, officials said. Sub-inspector D. Shailaja of the Mannaekhalli police in Karnataka told Deccan Chronicle: “We have received a call on Saturday morning about an unidentified body.” She said that preliminary investigation based on the statements of Madhu’s family members indicated that the murder could be the result of previous enmity. “CCTV footage from the area showed four persons abandoning his body in a deserted place. It shows that they might have murdered him somewhere else,” Shailaja said. According to reliable sources, on Friday afternoon Madhu's friend Renuka Prasad and two others, Nikith and P. Gopi, took Madhu from his house. Madhu informed his family members that he was going to Bidar with them for some work. Later that night, he called again to say he was on his way back home. On Saturday morning, the police informed the family about Madhu's murder. They immediately rushed to the scene. Investigations are underway to ascertain motive behind the murder, the police said.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: India is urgently in need of stem cell donors to fight blood cancer that kills over 70,000 lives every year, said experts on Monday ahead of World Blood Cancer Day. World Blood Cancer Day is observed every year on May 28 to raise awareness about deadly cancer and other blood disorders, such as thalassemia and aplastic anaemia, which affect more than a lakh people in the country, Although conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is the only hope for survival for many blood cancer patients. The health experts noted that every 5 minutes, someone in India gets diagnosed with blood cancer. Yet, the country faces a severe shortage of blood stem cell donors. “Besides being the thalassemia capital of the world, India also has a high prevalence of blood cancers. Stem cell transplants are often the only curative option for these conditions, but finding a compatible stem cell match is difficult, especially in a country as genetically diverse as India,” Dr Rahul Bhargava, Principal Director & Chief BMT, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, told IANS. “In India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants,” added Patrick Paul, CEO of DKMS BMST Foundation India — a non-profit.",

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – As the crisis surrounding the Kano Emirate continues, a group, Northern Professionals Forum, has asked the deposed Emir, Aminu Ado Bayero, to allow peace to reign in Kano. The call is contained in a Communiqué issued in Kano on Monday, after the group’s meeting attended by its chapters drawn from the 19 Northern states. The Communiqué, which was read to newsmen by the Director-general of the Forum, Arch.Usman Yusuf, also enjoined politicians with vested interest in the crisis to eschew bitterness and support the new law reinstating Emir Sanusi. “We admonish and call upon the Former Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, to toe the path of Honour and dignity, and allow peace to reign in Kano State. “We equally enjoin all politicians who are the author’s of balkanising the Long Historic monolithic Kano Emirate, to eschew bitterness, and embrace the new law, for the onward progress and continued coexistence of peace-loving people of Kano State. “As indigenous professionals of Northern Nigeria; from diverse fields of expertise and scholarship – we have observed with keen interest the controversy surrounding the executive assent and approval of the Kano State Emirates Council Amendment Law (Repeal Bil) 2024, passed by the State House of Assembly, approved by Kano State Executive Council and assented to; by His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Kano State. “Having inductively looked at the issues at stake, and of course, upon our legal luminary’s professional counsel and advice; as well, expert autopsy of the subject matter we hereby affirm that the actions of the Kano State House of Assembly, was done in accordance with the provisions of the law and extant rules. “Furthermore, the subsequent approval, assenting of the Bill, consequential dissolution of the embattled Emirates and Reinstatement of His Royal Highness, Muhammadu Sanusi II, as 16th Emir of Kano – were all in tandem with the rule of law and powers conferred on the Governor as enshrined in 1999 constitution (as amended). “Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II, being one of Arewa’s finest intellectual property, an internationally celebrated economic magnet, a repertoire of Islamic Ideals and Knowledge, as well an orator of high standing – is the best bait for contemporary development of Kano State, the North and Nigeria in general”, the Forum added. Abdullahi Yusuf is a seasoned journalist, communicator and was previously the Deputy Editor-In-Chief and Zonal Manager, News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, Jos, where he retired on December 15, 2021",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "One of the most shocking firings in recent professional wrestling history is the one of Scott D’Amore’s . D’Amore was the former president of TNA Wrestling, but he was surprisingly let go by parent company Anthem in February. Multiple wrestlers who had worked with him in the past had nothing but positive things to say about him. Recently, the Aerial Assassin Will Ospreay also shared his thoughts on the former TNA President. While speaking to Adrian Hernandez , Will Ospreay shared how important Scott D’Amore was to TNA Wrestling. The Aerial Assassin also wanted All Elite Wrestling to hire D’Amore in some fashion. He also wished that the promotion would hire him to look after Ring of Honor. “I remember when I was back there for the IMPACT Show where they announced that it was going to be TNA in January. I looked in the ring and I saw Scott D’Amore in there. And I can’t tell you how much respect I have for Scott D’Amore. And like, if there was anything that I want to put out there... If there is a way that AEW could hire Scott D’Amore in any type of fashion like, have that guy run Ring of Honor or something. “Because the passion that he had for TNA and just how he completely single-handedly transformed that company... I watched him say, that this is TNA and I saw Josh Alexander in there, I saw Jordynne Grace in there, I saw Gisele Shaw, I saw all of these guys, and I just looked... And I was like, ‘Yeah man! That was TNA. That is TNA.’ All the guys that they got there now, that is TNA man!” Will Ospreay said. Would you like to see Scott D’Amore sign with AEW?

        "content": "On a hot afternoon on May 16, 2020, former President Muhammadu Buhari stood at the forecourt of the Aso Rock Villa, squinting into the distance. Few situations keep the President of Nigeria at that part of the complex, one being to receive a visiting counterpart. Buhari looked expectant, gazing at an approaching BMW Sedan conveying President Umaro Embaló of Guinea-Bissau, one of his most vocal political ‘sons’. Embaló, a retired military general, had assumed office less than three months earlier and was seeing Buhari for the third time. After closed-door talks, the new president told reporters in his distinctive accent, “You know, me with President Buhari, we don’t have the relationship between two presidents. It is a son-and-father relationship. For me, in any situation, I can come to greet my father. That is why I am here.” Inside, he said to Buhari, “The problems of Guinea Bissau are the problems of Nigeria. I have come to you as your son. I need your help and assistance to make the people happy. I will not let you down, nor will I put you in any difficult situation.” Until Buhari’s tenure ended, Embaló remained a regular visitor to the State House, consulting with his ‘father’. Another leader who gave Buhari a similar fatherly status was Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed. On October 3, 2021, when Buhari arrived in Addis Ababa for Ahmed’s second-term inauguration, Ahmed personally received and chauffeured Buhari from the airport. Fast forward to Thursday, May 16, 2024, exactly four years since Embaló, Buhari’s successor, Bola Tinubu, found himself in a similar role. He stood at the same spot as Buhari, ready to receive Africa’s youngest President, Bassirou Faye of Senegal. Faye won an unprecedented victory at the presidential election of March 24, polling about 54 per cent. He was sworn into office on April 2 and was visiting Nigeria for the first time. The new president arrived at the State House at 03:09 pm to a red-carpet reception as the pipers escorted his vehicle to the forecourt. After the niceties, Tinubu led his visitor to the Drawing Room for a bilateral meeting. Journalists did not see the talks lasting too long since this was only a courtesy visit, not a state visit. However, that notion held less and less water as the minutes ticked by. I started to see why this could be another father-son visit. Who knows? Tinubu, in his bid to help, may have switched into daddy mode and begun a long lecture on governance, family, and how to lead a country with two first ladies. These assumptions seemed probable since the Senegalese leader had held no political office before emerging as President. At the meeting, Faye told Tinubu, “I know I can rely on your wisdom and experience as the leader of this great African nation and the more recent example of Senegal, so that together, hand in hand, we can grow together, and that we can discuss with our brothers (Niger, Mali, and Burkina-Faso) and convince them to come back into the fold (ECOWAS), to come back and share our common democratic values and what we stand for. “Your wisdom and your democratic values should be an asset to that vision, and my youth and determination can also be an asset. If we come together, with all these assets and advantages, I am convinced we can open a window of opportunity to discuss. “United, we are stronger. Faced with common challenges, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, and all other challenges, we need to show resolve to confront these challenges so that economically, we can thrive and satisfy the wishes of our people.” Faye may be new to national leadership, but he has always borne a heart of service to his people. He may be green, starting his political career from the top, but he is not ignorant of the Senegal he inherited. Tinubu likely attested to this when he told Faye, “I am glad that you are a shining example of patience, perseverance, and commitment to democratic values. We must partner to make our people the focus of our democratic commitment.” In the end, both leaders agreed to reopen talks with the military juntas of Niger, Mali, and Burkina-Faso to reintegrate them into the ECOWAS. It was over in precisely an hour. At 04:09 pm, I saw Tinubu accompany Faye to the black BMW Sedan as the pipers ushered him out of the forecourt. The previous day, Tinubu had commissioned via Zoom three gas projects: the AHL Gas Processing Plant 2 in Delta State, the ANOH Gas Processing Plant, and the ANOH-OB3 CTMS Gas Pipeline Projects in Imo State. The gas projects have a combined estimated output of 1,400 million standard cubic feet per day. The Presidency often arranges hybrid ceremonies via Zoom for projects involving multiple locations. The President sits in the Council Chamber and follows the ceremony on the screen before him. He then presents his speech and commissions the project as the proceedings are beamed live to the audience onsite. Former President Buhari commissioned several projects this way, but this was Tinubu’s first. And he was in for a funny ride. After several rehearsals, the anchors in Imo and Delta were doing a great job until it was time for the President to deliver the keynote address. While calling on Tinubu to speak, the MC from one of the locations announced, “His Excellency, the President, will now deliver his address after the national anthem.” Okay, I knew there was a mix-up here. The national anthem is only sung to open or close such ceremonies. How weird would it be to stand up and sing before the President speaks? You could see the mild confusion on Tinubu’s face as he held his right palm facing up, probably asking himself, “Is this a new style?” When the MC corrected herself, the President delivered his address, still smiling at the slight blunder. Later that Wednesday, Tinubu received members of the Supreme Council of Traditional Rulers of Ogoni, Rivers State, at the State House. The visit continues a long tradition where Ogoni leaders visit a sitting President with requests to expedite the Ogoni cleanup. Similar visits were made to Tinubu’s predecessor, who, although kicked off a $1bn cleanup and restoration programme in 2017, never completed it until he left office last May. As of April 2022, the then Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, confessed that the Ogoni Cleanup Project would not be completed within the remaining time for Buhari. At Wednesday’s meeting, Tinubu said his administration would “pursue” the Ogoni cleanup. “There is equally the Ogoni cleanup programme that I inherited. That will be pursued diligently and honourably,” he said. Knowing the complexity of the undertaking, Tinubu may be avoiding roping himself into too strong a promise by simply “pursuing” the project. However, will he break the generational jinx or will the cleanup defy him too?",

Earlier, Barrister Murtaza Wahab announced his plan to install solar-powered streetlights on 106 roads of Karachi. He said thatdue to the ever-increasing tariff of the electricity, the KMC would install streetlights that would be powered by solar panels. He said that the solarization plan has not yet been successful in Karachi because of the warm temperature and the dusty weather. He said that a plan being evaluated to energise streetlights with solar panels and make sure they do not get covered with dust. Wahab said that in coming 10 days 32 roads in the SITE area will be inaugurated. He said that Shahrah-e-Noorjahan was built by the People’s Party, but another political party hoisted its flags on the road.",

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "DALLAS — A year ago, Anthony Edwards sat silently at his locker after Minnesota went down 3-0 to Denver in the first-round series and stared into the mirror before eventually getting up and walking out without saying a word. Two days later, he scored 34 points on the strength of five three-pointers to lead the Timberwolves to a Game 4 victory over the Nuggets. The win, the only victory of last year’s playoffs for Minnesota, had meaning to Edwards. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t ever want to say I got swept in my career,” he said. Mike Conley sat at his locker after Minnesota’s dramatic Game 7 victory in Denver in the Western Conference semifinals, and was asked, “What’s next?” Conley secured his first career playoff sweep in Round 1 against Phoenix. He notched his first Game 7 victory in Denver. Surely, there was another box to check on the horizon. The veteran point guard’s answer: “Win a conference finals game.” ADVERTISEMENT Conley’s goals are certainly higher than that; the 36-year-old point guard yearns to win an NBA championship before he hangs up his sneakers. But it’s well documented by now that this is Conley’s second conference finals appearance – and first since 2013. And his team in 2013, the Memphis Grizzlies, was swept by San Antonio that season. An identical exit would likely cut a little deeper 11 years later. No NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-7 series in 154 tries — and both the Wolves and Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals find themselves in such a hole. So no, it’s not likely Minnesota will reel off four straight victories to reach the franchise’s first NBA Finals. Though, hey, who knows? But just nabbing a win Tuesday in Game 4 would mean something. It would mean no sweep of Edwards. It would mean another small career achievement for Conley. It would also mean Minnesota gets to fight another day. ADVERTISEMENT That’s the Wolves’ plan. “I just told them to keep fighting. We fight. We’ve been fighting all series, and we’re not going to stop fighting,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “We’ll look at it, we’ll build it back up and we’ll be ready to go on Tuesday, and see what happens from there.” It’s true, the Wolves have been resilient all year. Whenever a player went down, another stepped up. When a deficit grew, the Wolves responded and rallied. Lest we forget the defending NBA champions led Minnesota by 20 points on their home court in the second half of a Game 7, and the Wolves still won. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the team that has routinely set new franchise marks will achieve an NBA first, as well. One thing is for sure: If the Wolves go down, it will be swinging. “If (there’s) a team that can do it, I think it’s us. We’re built to do that,” Wolves forward Naz Reid said. “Everybody still got their heads up. You don’t want to go down 0-3, but it’s part of life. We’re not going to hang our head about it. We’re going to go out there and fix it.” It’s worth a try. ADVERTISEMENT “We ain’t got nothing else to do,” Edwards said. “We can’t do nothing but be positive at this point. We can’t be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "Ever since the Society was cruelly canceled after the first season, fans have been crying out for it to somehow return – and our hopes could possibly get answered soon. The beloved series premiered on Netflix in May, 2019, and followed teenagers who were displaced from their hometown while on a school trip – and thrown into an identical version, without any adult supervision. They were forced to take things into their own hands and created their own community, but things quickly got out of hand and spiraled into a Lord of the Flies-style situation with an almighty cliffhanger. Viewers watched in their droves, with TV bosses initially renewing the program for a second season, but it was eventually canceled due to the global pandemic , leading to huge backlash. Five years on, fans’ calls for more episodes have not quietened , with creator Christopher Keyser touched by the huge response – teasing that those behind the camera are always trying to come up with ways to move the story on. In fact, we were almost close to getting new episodes in the form of a graphic novel before the publishing company went bust. ‘This wasn’t a normal cancellation. This wasn’t about not having the audience or we didn’t believe in it anymore. There was a global crisis that changed all of our lives in the one year we were able to make it,’ he insisted to Variety . ‘I have consistent conversations with a bunch of the writers and Marc Webb [executive producer] about how we might bring this back in some way. We don’t have an answer yet, and I wouldn’t count on it, but I don’t do that with every show that gets canceled. ‘The audience still wants to talk about it. They are still moved by it and want answers to the questions and then new questions are posed. I just don’t know whether the world is going to work in a way that aligns for us, but we’ll keep trying for a while because it’s gotten under my skin as well.’ Kathryn Newton, Gideon Adlon, Olivia DeJonge, Toby Wallace and Jacques Colimon led the cast of youngsters as they desperately tried to understand their plight, and how their lives had changed in the blink of an eye. The first series ended on a huge cliffhanger as viewers learned that the parents of the teens were still alive and well back in ‘normality’, and believed that their children had somehow died. We also had questions about where the school buses transporting the students actually went after vanishing in thin air, and whether the two timelines would ever merge again. Netflix bosses announced the decision to cancel The Society – as well as I Am Not Okay With This – in August, 2020, in the middle of the globall Covid-19 pandemic. ‘We’ve made the difficult decision not to move forward with second seasons of The Society and I Am Not Okay With This,’ they said at the time. ‘We’re disappointed to have to make these decisions due to circumstances created by Covid, and we are grateful to these creators, including: Jonathan Entwistle, Christy Hall, Shawn Levy, Dan Levine, Dan Cohen and Josh Barry at 21 Laps Entertainment for I Am Not Okay With This; Chris Keyser, Marc Webb and Pavlina Hatoupis for The Society; and all the writers, casts and crews who worked tirelessly to make these shows for our members around the world.’ Remaining coy about what could happen next – in case their plans for a revival or a graphic novel ever come to fruition, Christopher vowed that they had the storylines already mapped out. ‘It really feels like this thing that we loved and were ready for was taken away more than anything I’ve ever done,’ he added. ‘That’s true for the writers and Marc Webb, with whom I made the show. There’s a sense that it stopped in mid-animation, but we knew a lot of what was going to happen on the other side. ‘There’s also the emotional thing going on with the audience reaching out to us and consistently saying, “Tell me what happened. When is it coming back?” It was particularly poignant for us since we were closer than I think most shows get to being ready to go again.’ Right on cue, fans began dissecting his comments on social media, begging Netflix to pick up more episodes once again for some much-needed ‘closure’. Taking to Twitter, Elise begged: ‘Bring the entire cast back and continue on, we as a society will ignore the fact they’ve aged.’ Ashley agreed: ‘OH MY GOD?! please I’m begging, I’ve literally never wanted a show to return more than The Society. I need closure!!!’ ‘We were robbed,’ Kathy fumed. ‘This show was renewed then cancelled when it should have been placed on delay. We deserve another season.’ Sam and Nia share marriage update after cheating admissions in Ashley Madison documentary Outraged Netflix subscribers threaten to cancel their memberships ahead of huge change Controversial Netflix series had 'worst TV ending in history' The top critically acclaimed films you didn't realise were on Netflix now Nowwhyami_innit pleaded: ‘Even if it’s one more season FINE! Just tell us wtf happened in that town.’ As Kat Pettibone added: ‘When I say I would sell my soul for this! It would be my biggest win.’ Honestly, hard same. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' Someone is literally renting out their garden shed – for £1,300 per month The Society is available to stream on Netflix now.

        "description": "The Orioles unveiled a new version of the hot dog race on Monday, with a human-sized version of Relish beating Mustard and Ketchup.",
        "content": "They’re normally digital condiments. On the Jumbotron in center field, three animated hot dogs representing three individual condiments — ketchup, mustard and relish — race around the bases. Not on Monday. Between the fourth and fifth innings of the Orioles’ Memorial Day game against the visiting Boston Red Sox, the trio appeared out of the fence near the out-of-town scoreboard in right field, punched the air, danced a bit, then lined up for a race as The Oriole Bird waved them on. Ketchup, donning red headphones, got the best break and held an early lead. Mustard, donning a squiggly yellow mustache, gained an advantage at the turn into the first base path. But Relish, who has green hair and once endured 34 straight winless home games in 2021 , legged out a late push for the win. The surprise race — like in Toy Story when the toys come to life — was part of a fan giveaway at the ballpark that offered fans condiment-themed T-shirts. Additionally, this real-world race will become a regular occurrence at Camden Yards this season. The next one will be on Sunday during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays with three more June races to follow. Baltimore isn’t the only ball club to have such lifelike races between innings. The Milwaukee Brewers have been sending a group of sausages racing around the ballpark since the 1990s. The Washington Nationals have the racing presidents and, like Relish, Teddy Roosevelt had a cold streak to open the season in 2006. Tampa Bay has a soda-branded race. The most terrifying of them all is likely Atlanta’s Home Depot hammer, saw, paint brush and power drill race. The Orioles are going a step further adding a “Meat” & Greet with the Camden Franks & The Oriole Bird from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday at the Weis Market in Pasadena. When the Detroit Tigers visit in late September, fans will be treated to three straight days of the mascot race. This story might be updated.",

        "description": "After the political change in the country, private schools reduced its fee by 50 percent on the basis of different reasons and there has been an increase in the number of newly enrolled students recently in these schools.",
        "content": "KABUL (Pajhwok): After the political change in the country, private schools reduced its fee by 50 percent on the basis of different reasons and there has been an increase in the number of newly enrolled students recently in these schools. Mohammad Haroon Rasouli, the Afghanistan’s Private Schools Union (APSU) director, told Pajhwok Afghan News that after the August 15, 2021 regime change, most of the private schools in the capital city of Kabul reduced the fees amount up to 50 percent because of economic problems but the number of the students’ enrollment in schools increased. Rasouli emphasized that public interest in private schools was increasing day by day due to the reduction of fee and so the quality of teaching was getting better and more standardized. However the government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) exempted only 4 percent of the private schools’ fee-duty, but the union had been experiencing more problems in paying their taxes and renewing permits prior and after the takeover by the IEA, Rasoli added. He said: “We faced more challenges during the previous government, we tried to resolve them in meetings with the officials, especially in meetings with education minister ... but unfortunately none of the problems was resolved.” He continued: “The officials of the IEA have more sympathy on us, they try to resolve the problems that we shared with them, however some of the problems are resolved while some of them still remain unsolved, we expect that the IEA will reconsider the issues of the private schools.” “We experience a lot of problems in renewing our schools’ licenses, we have to renew our licenses after every four years once, and getting a new license is easier than its renewal ... the payment of continuous and different duties is another issue.” He added. He said: “If the government makes the 4 percent tax exemption as a permanent discount in duties for private schools, it can help to some extent, the schools must also pay 20 percent of their fee-tax, if it is reduced to 5 or 10 percent that would be better too.” The private schools were also bound to get an operational license from the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA), if the renewal and issuance of schools’ licenses authority is limited to the Ministry of Education (MoE) that would be better.” However, the private schools paid 500 afs monthly tax per square meter billboard advertisement to the municipality during the previous government but the government of the IEA increased this fee to 2,000 afs, he urged authorities to reconsider the discount in this fee. According to Rasoli’s information, right now there are about 5,000 active private schools nationwide. The Etimad Milli Private School vice-principal Zahra Ibrahim Khel told Pajhwok, they reduced the fee of the school by 50 percent after the takeover by the IEA because of the increased economic problems, so the number of the new enrolled students increased. For instance, she said the schools charged each student 1,500 afs monthly fee in secondary and high school level, but now this fee is reduced to 750 afs monthly. The fee of primary level was 1,000 afs monthly which is now only half of this sum, she added. Ibrahim Khel asked the government of the IEA to pay serious attention to the reduction of duties and simplification of licenses renewal procedures. The founder of Talash Danish private school Baba Haidar Jafari said, his school had seven branches in Kabul and central Bamyan provinces and they also reduced the students’ fee up to 50 percent. Referring to the increasing number of students, he said girls above grade six were allowed to study, the number of their student can probably jump higher than this. Haidar added, with the cut in students’ fee, they also reduced the salaries of their teachers by 40 percent. Baba Haidar asked the government for cut in duties and simplification of the schools licenses’ issuance and extension procedures. Pajhwok tried to get the viewpoint of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), Kabul municipality and the AISA authority on requests for the reduction of duties and the cut in advertisement boards’ charges and the simplification of licensing procedures but no response was provided. The only official who commented on this was the Kabul municipality representative Nimatullah Barakzai, he said: “The tax on advertisements’ boards charges are paid to the government based on a legal regulation, only the shops are exceptionally exempted from paying this tax, but if they display more advertisement alongside the roads or on pathways, they would be dealt with in accordance with the laws.” Aw/nh Views: 4",

        "content": "In today's DNA, Zee News' Saurabh Raaj Jain, analysed the final round of the 'battle of bengal' lok sabha elections. He also analysed the roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. With a massive roadshow in Kolkata, Prime Minister Modi is expected to mount a last-ditch effort in the Bengal elections—this will be his final face-to-face meeting with Mamata Banerjee. The \"Bangalir Mone Modi\" roadshow will travel through important historical sites. Modi will travel in a hi-tech bulletproof car, showcasing a grand spectacle of Bengali culture. The theme of Modi’s roadshow, ‘Bangalir Mone Modi’, translates to ‘Modi is in the heart of Bengalis’. The Prime Minister’s 2-km roadshow will commence from Vidhan Saryan of Shyam Bazar and conclude at Swami Vivekananda’s house. This route holds historical significance as it was frequently used by Swami Vivekananda to visit his Guru, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. In today's DNA, Zee News' Saurabh Raaj Jain, analysed the final round of the 'battle of bengal' lok sabha elections. He also analysed the roadshows by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. DNA : 'चुनावी फाइट' का Final Round. 'बैटल ऑफ बंगाल' में मोदी V/s ममता मोदी का 'मेगा शो' 9 सीटें पलट देगा? #DNA #DNAWithSourabh #Elections2024 #WestBengal #NarendraModi #MamataBanerjee @saurabhraajjain pic.twitter.com/mbdVU0uRki Modi’s roadshow, the first by a sitting prime minister in Kolkata in 38 years, will be a grand spectacle of Bengali culture, with 40 stages set up along the route showcasing Chhau dance, kirtan, and Rabindra Sangeet. Mamata Banerjee, on the other hand, has been seen to strategically position her campaign events to coincide with or follow Modi’s. She will hold a rally in south Kolkata at the same time Modi is in North Kolkata and will campaign along the same route in North Kolkata the following day to counteract the Modi effect. The seventh phase of the election will decide the fate of 9 seats in Bengal, all of which were won by the TMC in 2019. The BJP is focused on winning these seats, while Mamata Banerjee’s mission is to retain them. The campaign has been charged, with both parties making strong allegations against each other.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into possible violations of international law, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of property crimes and looting were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, a ruling it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "Square Enix has largely kept its lips sealed about the Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake since announcing it three years ago, but the publisher has now revealed which platforms it's coming to. When it eventually arrives, you'll be able to play it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam).Since Square Enix started using its distinctive HD-2D tech with Octopath Traveller, the company has put it to use in a string of titles, including that game's sequel, Triangle Strategy, the Live A Live remake and Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster's opera scene. Based on the reveal trailer from 2021, the HD-2D engine is set to give Dragon Quest 3 a serious visual upgrade, nearly three decades after the original game arrived in 1988.The legend of Erdrick draws near. #DragonQuestDay #DQDay #DragonQuest pic.twitter.com/KFtqhVY61q— DRAGON QUEST (@DragonQuest) May 27, 2024 The new version may not be too far away either. The teaser suggested that the Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake \"draws near,\" several months after series creator Yuji Horii said he was playtesting it. With Summer Game Fest and all its associated events just around the corner, we could find out more details about the remake very soon.Square Enix released the teaser on Dragon Quest Day, which marks the anniversary of the very first game in the series debuting in Japan in 1986. Horii took the opportunity to provide an minor update on the next mainline entry as well. Square Enix announced Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate back in 2021, but there's been no sign of a release date as yet. That said, Horii wants it to live up to the legacies of key Dragon Quest creatives Akira Toriyama and Koichi Sugiyama.“Thank you so much to everyone for the many [Dragon Quest Day] congratulations!” Horii wrote on X, according to a Gematsu translation. “There has been some worry about Dragon Quest XII, but I was actually in a meeting [about it] until just a bit ago.

        "content": "Square Enix has largely kept its lips sealed about the Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake since announcing it three years ago, but the publisher has now revealed which platforms it's coming to. When it eventually arrives, you'll be able to play it on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam). Since Square Enix started using its distinctive HD-2D tech with Octopath Traveller , the company has put it to use in a string of titles, including that game's sequel , Triangle Strategy , the Live A Live remake and Final Fantasy VI Pixel Remaster 's opera scene. Based on the reveal trailer from 2021 , the HD-2D engine is set to give Dragon Quest 3 a serious visual upgrade, nearly three decades after the original game arrived in 1988. The legend of Erdrick draws near. #DragonQuestDay #DQDay #DragonQuest pic.twitter.com/KFtqhVY61q — DRAGON QUEST (@DragonQuest) May 27, 2024 The new version may not be too far away either.

        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin CHARLOTTE, USA - MAY 10: A view of an unusual sun activity created a sunspot, that is responsible ... [+] for a G4 Geostorm on Earth, the last time this magnitude happened was 20 years ago in Charlotte NC, United States on May 10, 2024. (Photo by Peter Zay/Anadolu via Getty Images) Sunspot AR3664 , which was last seen blasting powerful solar explosions our direction that generated historic and widespread aurora, has rotated back into view on the surface of the sun and already unleashed an X-class flare early Monday. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center recorded a flare off the southeast limb of the sun that measured X2.8. X-flares are the strongest classification of flares although we saw several stronger flares earlier this month. The higher the number, the stronger the intensity of the flare, which can cause radio and other communication blackouts on Earth. However, the strength of a flare is just one of many factors that impacts how solar unrest impacts systems on our planet. Aurora and disruptions to electrical systems are actually more closely associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are eruptions of charged particles that can take a few days to reach Earth. CMEs are also directional, so when one is thrown off from a sunspot that is more directly aimed at Earth, it’s more likely to result in stronger impacts. The source of the May 10 solar superstorm that generated aurora seen in all fifty states for the first time in decades was also sunspot AR3664, when it was more directly aimed at Earth in early May. The sun rotates on its axis like Earth does, and sunspot AR3664 has spent the past few weeks on the far side of the sun that faces away from our planet, but is just now rotating back into view from our vantage point.

This image taken from Macleod in suburban Melbourne, Australia on May 12th 2024. (Photo credit should read Chris Putnam/Future Publishing via Getty Images) This all means we could be in store for an encore of what was seen on May 10 in the next week or two. No official forecasts have been put out yet that include a repeat of this month’s superstorm, but the sun is a very fickle thing. We will learn a lot about what’s to come by watching closely this week. If Monday’s X-flare is any indication, there’ more excitement to come, especially as this solar cycle is thought by many to be a year or more away from its peak in activity.

At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida.

It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important.

North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology.

The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep.

        "description": "As Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial is winding down, the threats for Stormy Daniels are never-ending, as the former pornstar continuously receives death wishes from Trump fans",
        "content": "Former president Donald Trump’s hush money trial is nearing its end, with closing arguments expected shortly. But for Stormy Daniels , the aptly named woman caught in the whirlwind, there’s no end to her ordeal. Indeed, Trump may be the one on trial, but it’s Stormy who’s been judged every day for the past five years. And unlike Trump’s New York jury of his peers, Stormy’s being judged by those with little mercy, little care for evidence, and scant regard for Justice. And with Trump making another run for The White House, she knows the haters and the abuse are only likely to get worse. Speaking from her home in Texas, Stormy says: “Back in 2018, there was stuff like ‘liar,' ‘slut,' ‘gold digger.' This time around, it’s different. It is direct threats. It is ‘I’m going to come to your house to slit your throat.'\" READ MORE: Donald Trump's confidence takes hit as he sends 'warning signal' to crowd booing him Stormy Daniels has opened up about her experience of the Trump hush money trial in a new documentary The intensified abuse and violent threats got worse after the decision to charge Trump over alleged hush money payments made to her. People have become so angry at her role in Trump’s potential downfall, that they have convinced themselves their beliefs and actions are valid. So much so, most are not even hiding their identities. “They’re not even using bot accounts, they’re using their real accounts,” she says. “I compare them to suicide bombers. They legitimately think that what they’re doing is right. Those people who see me as a villain. “It just makes me scratch my head and really question how they would want their daughters treated, or their sisters, or their mother.” The new documentary will air as closing arguments are heard in the trial For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Her comments are featured in a new TV documentary, Stormy, to be shown for the first time on Tuesday night in the UK on Channel 5. It’s timed as the trial reaches its final stages. During a car ride, Stormy reads out some of the vile messages she has received including: “Even if you’d have been raped, you should have kept your mouth quiet for the greater good” and “You’re nothing but a fat hillbilly, Trump would never touch you, stop lying, before I’m forced to shut you up myself” Stormy Daniels thanked her attorney, Clark Brewster She adds that that is a ‘direct threat.' Earlier this month, Stormy, 45, testified in the criminal fraud trial of former President Trump, where she made a number of bombshell claims about her alleged affair with him. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has accused Trump of falsifying business records to disguise an alleged $130,000 (£104,000) hush-money payment made to Daniels in a bid to hide damaging information just before the US election in 2016. Stormy, who married her fourth husband, Barret Blade, in December 2022, claimed that Trump would call her at least once a week during their affair and beg her to see him. She said he would “profess his love and beg to see me again.\" Trump is facing 34 counts of falsifying business records in the hush money trial ( Image: POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Stormy - whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford - is then seen sitting at her kitchen table surrounded by piles of legal documents and praises her attorney, Clark Brewster. “There is a never ending avalanche of court documents, lawsuits and court transcripts”, she says. “I wanted to die. If I had all of these legal bills piled up. I would never have been able to pay them. And Clark is the only one who never charged me and kept fighting for me. I can’t even imagine where I would be.” Stormy Daniels said she's 'desensitised' now She talks philosophically about what she has learnt since the story first broke. “The way this is different from 2018 is that I have more knowledge, “ she says. “The shock of it’s not the same. I’m desensitised to some of it. But they’ve also become more violent with me. “I’m more prepared with my legal knowledge but I’m also tired. Like my soul is so tired.” She also described why she signed the NDA, claiming she was afraid for her family if she didn’t. For Stormy, she will just be pleased when this is finally over.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

Mayor Cllr Dai Morgan and fellow Town Council member Cllr Tom Sloan who has held exhibitions at Tenby Museum and Art Gallery as well as featuring on Sky Arts’ Landscape Artist of the Year programme, recently approached Greenhill School about an idea to involve the students, meeting with head David Haynes and head of art Ali Lambert. “It started off with the idea of a ‘Tenby arts fair’ to be held on South Parade on June 5 and July 17, where the students would have some stalls in amongst other traders, so hopefully they could not only show off their art, but commercially, go one step further and sell their own prints,” explained Cllr Morgan. Going Away In Order To Return - local artist’s exhibition in Haverfordwest Pembrokeshire College student Phoebe-Lily and the future of set design Cllr Chris Walters 'honoured' to be Narberth Mayor once again Pembroke Town Council firms up events for autumn/winter 2024 “We then eventually agreed that the next event ‘Paint Castle Hill’ to be held on July 3, should be open to anyone to have a go, no matter if you're a professional artist or if you have never picked up a brush before! “Those taking part can pick a spot on Castle Hill and paint, draw or sketch whatever they see, which would then link into the third and final event, a Tenby Arts Show in the De Valence Pavilion on August 10 and 11, where anyone, if they wish, can exhibit their work.” All events are free to enter and you can just show up with no need to book. “These events will hopefully happen every year and they are the foundations of many more art events to come for the community to get involved,” added Cllr Morgan. All events will take place between 10am and 4pm. To keep up to date you can follow ‘Tenby Arts Events’ on Facebook or contact the Town Council on 01834 842370. Some availability is left for the arts fair market stalls. If anyone would like a space, please email:",

        "content": "Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. “It’s more nerve-racking watching than playing,” the 34-year-old centre said. “But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. Story continues below advertisement “You’re just itching to be a part of that.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. 1:34 Ice District regulars: Meet the stars of the Edmonton Oilers watch party Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. McLeod comes out of Edmonton’s lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers’ penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the “reset” the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. Story continues below advertisement “There’s a lot to like about his game,” said the coach. “A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He’s been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn’t been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. “We’ve got a lot of players that are playing well. It’s been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.” Hintz, the Stars’ No. 1 centre, hasn’t played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Monday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. “He’s just an awesome player,” Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. “He’s one of the best players in the in the world. You can’t really replace a guy like that. “Being able to get him back, it would be huge.” The game starts shortly after 6:30 p.m. MT.",

        "content": "Dikla Arava, 51 and her son Tomer Arava Eliaz, 17, were murdered by Hamas terrorists in Kibbutz Nahal Oz on October 7. Terrorists stormed into the home of Noam Elyakim, Dikla’s longtime boyfriend, whose two daughters, Dafna, 15 and Ela, 8, were also home. The terrorists cruelly forced Tomer at gunpoint to knock on the doors of their neighbors and try to convince them to come outside — all the while livestreaming their psychological and physical terror on Dikla’s Facebook page. Ultimately, the terrorists murdered Tomer, Dikla and Noam, and kidnapped Dafna and Ela to Gaza, where they were held captive for 51 days before being released as part of a truce deal on November 26. Dikla and Tomer’s bodies were only discovered and identified more than a week after the attack, outside the kibbutz grounds. They were buried side by side on October 16 in Kfar Maimon. Dikla and Tomer are survived by their two other older children/siblings, Odin and Stav, and Tomer is also survived by his father, Ma’ayan. A eulogy from the kibbutz lauded Tomer, a student in 12th grade, for “acting with bravery in the face of the murderers who took him as a captive... Tomer acted calmly and with nobility at the gunpoint of the killers.” The teenager, the kibbutz said, was “a magical boy, an angel, a golden child with a good heart, full of joy for life.” His friends and family noted his love of trance music and festivals, as well as his addiction to the gym and working out. On an Instagram memorial page set up for Tomer, his sister, Odin, wrote there are “not enough words that can describe what a wonderful person you were.” “Thank you for everything you were to me, that you always worried about me and put me first, even on that horrible Saturday when you thought about me and checked if I was OK,” she wrote. “Thank you for opening your heart before me like you never did with anyone else. Thank you for recording our conversations which are now all I have left to make me smile again. My angel — you always wanted to be taller than me, and now you are in the highest place in heaven and looking down on me from above.” Weeks after she returned from captivity, Dafna wrote on Instagram that “my Tomer, I miss you so much, it’s hard for me without you. Until 135 days ago we would go to school together every day, and now I go to school alone every day.” In April, Dafna wrote a message to Dikla, noting that it had been “196 days that I haven’t heard you, 196 days that I haven’t seen your smile in person and not in photos, 196 days that you are watching over me from above... I hope you are happy and joyful up there.” The kibbutz eulogy for Dikla noted that she ran the education system for Nahal Oz, and in later years was an educational consultant for preschools. “Dikla was full of life, loved to dance, to be happy, was a warrior mother for her children,” the eulogy noted. “Her charming smile and laughter will be missed in all of our meetings.” Maayan Zin, Noam’s ex-wife and the mother of Dafna and Ela, wrote on Facebook that Dikla “loved my daughters so much and my girls loved Dikla so much.” She said that Dafna and Dikla “connected immediately — Dafna loved her from the first minute they met, they would swap shoes, put on makeup and laugh, Dikla was so present in her life.” Ela, she said, “doesn’t know any life without Dikla. Without Dikla’s family.” “So yes, Dikla is the new girlfriend, but what Dikla gave to Dafna and Ela and Noam nobody can take away from her,” added Maayan. “I just hope she didn’t suffer in her final moments.” Shalev Zarka, who is married to Dikla’s niece, noted in a eulogy at the funeral that when he joined the family five years earlier, “I heard so many stories about you, and when we met we fell in love in a moment.” “Aunt Diki, I love you so much. You were a listening ear to me at any time of day — every phone call from you, every cigarette with you by the fish pond was an experience I will never forget,” he said. “And Tomer — ‘Tomer the king’ — that’s how you are written in my phone,” Shalev continued. “You were the king in my eyes. Determined in every task, working out like crazy, we would compete in the gym — and you at age 17 would crush me every time. I will take your determination to reach every goal and stand by it. The desire to be the best at everything you wanted to be.” “Tomer, even in your final moments, when we saw you facing the terrorists, you were such a warrior. Determined and composed. I love you so much.” Read more Those We Have Lost stories here.",

        "content": "POTTSTOWN — A threatened thunderstorm held back Monday morning long enough for the borough’s Memorial Day Parade and Services to be held. Leaving from its muster point in front of the Goodwill Firehouse at High and Bailey streets, the parade made its way west along High Street, cut a right onto Manatawny Street and headed to the Veterans Island area of Memorial Park. More than 14 fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, a sampling of classic cars, flag-bearing motorcycles, military vehicles and marching bands from Pottstown and Pottsgrove middle schools were all part of the all-American event marching down an all-American Main Street. There were almost as many American flags as there was chrome on this vintage Cadillac in Pottstown's Memorial Day Parade Monday. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Pottsgrove Middle School Band was one of two bands that marched in Monday's Memorial Day Parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown Police Officers rode patrol bikes along the parade route to ensure the safety of all. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Members of the St. Nicholas Patriotic Society brought along their best classic cars for the Memorial Day Parade Monday in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Classic military vehicles joined the other classic cars that participated in Monday's Memorial Day parade in Pottstown. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Crowds, smaller than some years no doubt due to the ever-present threat of rain, were nonetheless enthusiastic and appreciative. At Memorial Park, the services organized by the Joint Veterans Council of Pottstown began by introducing Joseph Tursi, USMC, the 2024 Veteran of the Year, who told the crowd simply to remember what, and who, the holiday is really meant for. Echoing Tursi’s sentiment, Rabbi Cynthia Kravitz of Congregation Hesed Shel Emet, offered a prayer whose theme was “We remember them.” Montgomery County Commissioner Tom DiBello called Memorial Day “the most important holiday on the U.S. calendar.” He quoted James Garfield, former Major General, then congressman and future U.S, president, who gave the address at the first Decoration Day celebration at Arlington National Cemetery in 1868: “We do not know one promise these men made, one pledge they gave, one word they spoke; but we do know they summed up and perfected, by one supreme act, the highest virtues of men and citizens. For love of country, they accepted death, and thus resolved all doubts, and made immortal their patriotism and their virtue.” The Owen J. Roberts ROTC unit leads the Pottstown Memorial Day parade Monday by carrying the colors. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The crowd at Monday's Memorial Day services on Veterans Island stand for the playing of the national anthem. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) The Korean War memorial wreath was one of 13 such wreaths placed on Veterans Island Monday during Pottstown's Memorial Day services. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Vietnam Veteran Jonathan Raden contemplates the World War II Memorial on Veterans Island Monday in Memorial Park. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) Pottstown resident and Navy veteran Jonathan Raden, points to the name of his father, Army veteran Joseph Raden, on the World War II Memorial in Pottstown's Veterans Island. (Evan Brandt -- MediaNews Group) DiBello said Montgomery County provided 62,000 flags for Memorial Day and has re0-named and refocused its veterans services department to be more effective. State Rep. Paul Friel, d-26th Dist., said “when we watch the American flag fully ascend once again, our thoughts will be with our servicemembers both lost and living — including the nearly 200,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines beyond our shores as we gather here, so ably protecting us far from home. They too join us in mourning the fallen. They too join us in celebrating our strength. And like those we remember today, they too serve in a long line of patriots who fought in places like Lexington and Concord; Gettysburg and Midway; and, more recently, Fallujah and Helmand.” “There is no greater sacrifice than to give your life in the defense of this nation,” said state Rep. Joe Ciresi, D-146th Dist. The day’s speaker was Robert W. Boyce, a retired submarine commander who also taught high school and was manager for a decade of the Limerick Nuclear Generating Station. “This holiday,” said Boyce, “is not about hot dogs and hamburgers. It’s about the men and women who served this nation to their death.” The nation, Boyce said, “is facing multiple crises” at the same time its armed forces are depleted. None of the military’s branches met their recruitment goals in the last year, he said, urging young people to join and “serve your country.” As the ceremony came to a close, Marine Corps veteran Billy Worrell stood along among the trees and flowers of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and mournfully played “Taps.”",

Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu emphasized that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had taken \"every precaution possible\" to protect civilians in Gaza. He insisted that the IDF had used their \"best efforts not to harm those uninvolved\" in the conflict, as reported by NBC News. The airstrike has drawn widespread condemnation from international organizations. The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called the strike \"horrifying,\" urging Israel to comply with a recent International Court of Justice ruling to halt strikes on Rafah. The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, criticized the attack, highlighting the lack of change in Israel's methods despite previous civilian casualties. According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the strike resulted in severe burns, fractures, and shrapnel wounds among hundreds of Palestinians. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported treating at least 180 wounded people and receiving 28 dead, including women and children. MSF condemned the strike, asserting that it showed a complete disregard for civilian lives in Gaza, as per BBC . The Palestinian Red Crescent stated that the airstrike targeted tents near a UN facility in Tal al-Sultan, approximately 2 kilometers northwest of Rafah. Graphic footage from the scene showed intense fires and severe casualties, including children. Despite Israeli claims that the strike targeted senior Hamas leaders, the presence of displaced civilians has raised significant questions about the strike's execution and intelligence basis. Netanyahu acknowledged the civilian casualties and announced an investigation to understand what went wrong. \"In Rafah, we already evacuated about one million non-combatant residents, and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,\" he said. \"We are investigating the incident and will reach conclusions because this is our policy.\" The attack has heightened tensions, with Qatar warning that it could derail cease-fire negotiations. Egypt reported a fatal incident involving its soldier at the Rafah border, further complicating the situation. The IDF acknowledged the shooting incident and confirmed ongoing discussions with Egyptian authorities. The U.S. National Security Council described the images from Rafah as \"heartbreaking,\" while affirming Israel's right to target Hamas. However, the council stressed the importance of minimizing civilian casualties. Israel © Copyright IBTimes 2024. All rights reserved.

        "description": "The latest fundraising effort for xAI, Musk's upcoming ChatGPT rival, draws investments from Saudi mogul Al-Waleed bin Talal among other major players; 'xAI to continue on this steep trajectory of progress over the coming months,' company says",
        "content": "Elon Musk's ambitious venture into the realm of generative AI, xAI, is making waves as it embarks on a monumental $6 billion Series B fundraising round. This move positions xAI as a formidable contender against the giants of the industry—OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. According to Musk, the round is based on an impressive pre-money valuation of $18 billion. \"Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming weeks,\" Musk teased on X (formerly Twitter). 2 View gallery Stepping up the fundraising, Elon Musk ( Photo: Reuters ) This massive fundraising effort comes less than a year after xAI's inception in July 2023. The company has announced that a host of prominent global investors are expected to participate, including the likes of Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Fidelity. Additionally, Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, one of the world's most influential investors, and his Kingdom Holding fund—also a minority shareholder in X—are on board. Over the past year, xAI has made remarkable strides, notably launching its first large language model, Grok-1. The name Grok is inspired by Robert Heinlein's iconic novel \"Stranger in a Strange Land,\" where the term means to understand something so deeply that it becomes part of you. Building on this, the company has also introduced Grok-1.5, which boasts enhanced capabilities for grasping complex contexts and understanding images. \"xAI has made significant strides over the past year,\" the company stated on their website. \"From the announcement of the company in July 2023, to the release of Grok-1 on X in November, to the recent announcements of the improved Grok-1.5 model with long context capability, to Grok-1.5V with image understanding, xAI’s model capabilities have improved rapidly. With the open-source release of Grok-1, xAI has opened doors for advancements in various applications, optimizations, and extensions of the model. xAI will continue on this steep trajectory of progress over the coming months, with multiple exciting technology updates and products soon to be announced. The funds from the round will be used to take the company’s first products to market, build advanced infrastructure, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies.\" This fundraising effort marks another significant chapter in the ongoing arms race within the GenAI sector, which has seen billions of dollars poured into various companies and ventures over the past eighteen months. OpenAI has amassed $13 billion from Microsoft, while Anthropic has raised $6 billion. Much of this investment goes towards acquiring the necessary computing resources for training and operating GenAI models, particularly NVIDIA AI processors, which are highly coveted and in short supply. \"Everyone sees AI as the future, leading to an unprecedented level of investment until proven otherwise,\" remarked Alex Clayton, a general partner at Meritech Capital, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \"The challenge lies in the uncertainty of what these business models will look like at scale. We have theories, but clarity is still elusive.\" Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI in 2015, parted ways with the company a few years later. Reports suggest his exit stemmed from a disagreement with CEO Sam Altman over control of the company. Musk's departure has since fueled tensions, culminating in a lawsuit against OpenAI in March. Musk accused the company of abandoning its original mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity, prioritizing profit over safety and caution. 2 View gallery Al Waleed bin Talal ( Photo: gettyimages ) While Musk's claims hold some weight—evidenced by the recent departure of key OpenAI executives Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike and the disbandment of their team focused on ensuring AI systems operate for humanity's benefit—experts believe the lawsuit lacks substantial merit. OpenAI contends that Musk's lawsuit is driven by regret over his current non-involvement. \"We believe the lawsuit stems from Musk's frustration at not being part of the company's current success,\" wrote Jason Kwan, Vice President of Strategy, in a memo to employees. Since its founding, xAI has integrated its operations closely with those of X. The startup enjoys exclusive access to the entire archive of posts from the social network for training its models, raising concerns about potential biases given the volume of hate speech, racism, anti-Semitism, and incitement on X since Musk's acquisition in late 2022. Earlier this month, it was reported that X plans to start publishing news summaries using the Grok chatbot. These summaries, based on user posts rather than third-party news sources, will be available exclusively to premium users on the platform. >",

        "content": "Richard Dreyfuss is in hot water with fans after a Q&A before a \"Jaws\" screening allegedly took a wild turn ... with many online accusing him of sexism and homophobia. The actor appeared at The Cabot Theater in Beverly, Massachusetts Saturday night for a discussion with fans of the hit 1975 film ... during which fans are saying he made comments about transgender people -- particularly transgender kids. Video of the rant itself hasn't surfaced yet ... but, a clip allegedly shot in the lead-up to the convo is floating around on YouTube -- and, it shows Dreyfuss wearing a dress and performing a dance of sorts to Taylor Swift 's \"Love Story.\" Check out the video, allegedly taken before the talk ... it's odd for sure, and though many fans are laughing, attendees online are making it clear nobody was laughing by the end of the talk with Dreyfuss who apparently said people shouldn't listen to kids who say they are transgender and want to transition. Social media users are saying Richard blasted the Academy Awards' new inclusivity rules too -- not exactly a shock 'cause he's done that quite a bit in recent months. Others are saying he said women are too passive to make big movies work, and some add he took shots at Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg . Again, we haven't actually heard what Richard said, and these are all claims people online are making ... but, they all tell a similar tale of Dreyfuss slamming minority groups -- and, it's not making the guy look good. I need to know what Richard Dreyfuss said at a jaws screening last night that inspired this email pic.twitter.com/qkIgrwbtqK The Cabot issued an apology for Richard's remarks Monday, stating clearly they do not endorse what the actor said in any way. We've reached out to Richard's reps ... so far, no word back.",

        "description": "Electoral participation reminds of legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave: CEC Rajiv KumarThe post ECI compliments J&K voters for 35-year high turnout appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: The Election Commission of India (ECI) Monday complimented the electorate of Jammu and Kashmir for the 35-year high voter turnout. The ECI termed J&K witnessing its highest poll participation in the last 35 years as a massive stride for India’s electoral polity. It said that the Combined Voter Turnout (VTR) at the polling stations for the entire J&K (5 Lok Sabha seats) was 58.46 percent in the Lok Sabha polls. The ECI said that this significant participation was a testament to the robust democratic spirit and civic engagement of the people in the region. The ECI led by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioners (ECs) Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu thanked the polling personnel and security officials for the peaceful conduct of elections in J&K. CEC Rajiv Kumar while conveying ECI’s compliments to the voters of J&K said, “This achievement sits on a credible weave of 25 percent increase in the number of contesting candidates since 2019, C-vigil complaints showing enhanced citizen involvement, and Suvidha Portal showing 2455 requests for rallies, reflecting the steady retaking of the election and campaign space away from hesitation and to fuller participation.” He compared this outcome of the layered depth of electoral mobilisation and participation, as reminiscent of the fame and deft of the legendary Kashmiri artisanal weave. Kumar said that this active participation was a huge positive for the assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in J&K. The voter turnout of 50.86 percent from the three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir echoes the faith of the people in the democratic process. The poll participation percentage witnessed 30 points jump from the last Lok Sabha polls in 2019 where it was 19.16 percent. The three parliamentary constituencies in Kashmir – Srinagar, Baramulla, and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded a voter turnout of 38.49 percent, 59.1 percent and 54.84 percent, which has been the highest in the last three decades. The other two parliamentary constituencies in J&K – Udhampur and Jammu recorded 68.27 percent and 72.22 percent voter turnout. The ECI said that the historic participation in J&K was realised by earnest efforts of the election and security officials who had worked tirelessly to empower the people of J&K, especially the youth to participate in the elections. It said that more young people had asserted their faith and embraced democracy in a big way. The ECI said that another interesting perspective is the electors in the age group of 18-59 years which forms the major part of electors in J&K. It said that the high poll percentage in Lok Sabha polls was reflective of their faith in democracy, which was a positive and heartening development. The ECI said that that commission also enabled Kashmiri migrant voters residing at various relief camps in Delhi, Jammu, and Udhampur to also have the option of voting in person at designated special polling stations or using postal ballot. It said that 21 special polling stations were established – 16 at Jammu, one at Udhampur, and four at Delhi. The ECI said that as part of awareness and outreach, a wide range of activities were organised under the SVEEP programme in J&K for Lok Sabha elections. The office of the Chief Electoral Officer, J&K, organised adventure sports events, symposiums, awareness rallies, nukkad nataks, and numerous other events to propagate the message of voting. Amongst various efforts, activities included creating igloos as a dummy polling station in Baramulla, para scooter event in Kathua, sensitisation in Beating the Retreat ceremony on Suchetgarh border, mega awareness rally in Teetwal near the Line of Control (LoC), near Dal Lake in Srinagar to Chougan in Kishtwar and playing instrumental version of ECI song on highest railway bridge. Musical programmes and activities were carried out at many places including Lal Chowk, Gulmarg, Kulgam, and Anantnag by famous singers. Every nook and corner of J&K witnessed a rejuvenation of democracy and victory of the ballot with thumping participation in polling, resulting in a record voter turnout.",

Michael DiRocco of ESPN reports that the Jaguars are by the two flight attendants for failing to supervise McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking a jury trial and more than $1 million in damages. The Jaguars declined an opportunity to comment and a statement from McManus or his attorney is expected to come later on Monday. McManus is accused of trying to kiss one woman while she was seated during a turbulent period of the September flight and “grinding up against her” during one of the flight’s meal services. The second woman also accuses McManus of grinding against her and then “smirked and walked away” when confronted about it. The lawsuit also claims that McManus offered money to other flight attendants to “drink and dance inappropriately.” McManus spent nine seasons with the Broncos before joining the Jaguars last year. He signed a one-year contract with the Commanders in March.",

        "description": "After divorcing themselves from former head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been linked to several candidates in their subsequent search for a new locker room leader.",
        "content": "After divorcing themselves from former head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the Cleveland Cavaliers have been linked to several candidates in their subsequent search for a new locker room leader. On the heels of Bickerstaff’s firing, Golden State Warriors assistant coach Kenny Atkinson and New Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego were revealed to be the frontrunners for the new vacancy. Days later, New York Knicks associate head coach Johnnie Bryant began gaining steam as a candidate . Now, “the prospect of hiring (former) Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts is among the scenarios Cleveland has contemplated in the initial stages of its coaching search,” per NBA insider Marc Stein. Cavs’ Coaching Search Heats Up With Terry Stotts Among the candidates that the Cavs are reportedly looking into, none has a resume that measures up to Stotts’s. The 2016 Coach of the Year runner-up, Stotts has amassed 540 wins between the regular and postseason. However, he’s ironically had similar success as another former Blazers head coach, Nate McMillan. Both won over half of their regular season games, but it was a different story in the playoffs. Stotts went 23-43, winning just 34.3 percent of his games. McMillan wasn’t much better, going 28-48 for a .368 win percentage. This ultimately led the Blazers to part ways with Stotts, who had led Portland to four First Round exits in five seasons. (McMillan was let go due to locker room disconnect, similar to Bickerstaff). When assessing Stotts as a head coach, the question is whether he’ll have more success in Cleveland. Under Stotts, the Blazers routinely had teams that excelled offensively. In his nine seasons with Portland, they had a top-10 scoring average in seven seasons. This is in large part due to their elite 3-point shooting. With the Cavs’ offense already tailored for 3-point barrages, Stotts should have a smooth transition so far as that end. Furthermore, with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum developing into stars under him, it inspires confidence in his ability to get the best out of the Donovan Mitchell – Darius Garland pairing. This is particularly important, as Garland may be concerned about how he’s valued if he continues playing alongside Mitchell. However, Stotts’ teams were almost always poor defensively, which is where the Cavs have shined under Bickerstaff. In Bickerstaff’s four full seasons as Cleveland’s head coach, the Cavs ranked in the top-seven in opponents points per game for three consecutive seasons. Their frontcourt personnel lent itself to above-average defense with their length and shot-blocking ability. Still, Bickerstaff even motivated less impactful defenders to play with more gusto. As a result, Garland started generating turnovers at a higher rate. Mitchell played with more energy at that end than he had since his early NBA days. Perhaps that effort will carry over, even without Bickerstaff. Even if it doesn’t, players like Evan Mobley won’t suddenly forget how to play defense. Nonetheless, Cleveland’s ability to continue playing dominant defense under Stotts is a legitimate concern with regard to his potential hire. The Last Word On Terry Stotts Stotts may be the best coaching hire for the Cavs. His background, developmental abilities, and experience coaching a two-headed monster in the backcourt is enticing. Furthermore, though the defensive concerns are sobering, Cleveland’s roster is more suited to hold up at that end. This is particularly true when comparing their respective frontcourts.

        "content": "OMAHA, Neb. — Tennessee, the Southeastern Conference regular-season and conference tournament champion and the consensus No. 1 team in the country for a month, on Monday was awarded the top national seed for the NCAA Tournament. The opens Friday with 16 double-elimination regionals. Winners advance to eight best-of-three super regionals. Those winners move on to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska, beginning June 14. The Volunteers haven’t lost consecutive games since mid-March and are the only team in the country to win 50 games three of the past four years. They will try to become the first No. 1 national seed to win the championship since Miami in 1999, the year the NCAA went to the current tournament structure. Tennessee, which has reached two of the past three College World Series, come into regionals in the top 10 nationally in five offensive categories. The Vols’ 147 homers are most in the nation, and Christian Moore has 28 to lead five Vols players with at least 17. The pitching staff has a 3.83 ERA and ranks in the top five in four other categories. “If you look back to August when it started, the group has had good vibes up at the field every day,” Vols coach Tony Vitello said. “That’s a good start because when you win or lose, it’s going to be fun to come to work every day, and you can probably improve because you have guys who are willing to listen and willing to work together.” The national seeds following Tennessee (50-11) are Kentucky (40-14), Texas A&M (44-13), North Carolina (42-13), Arkansas (43-14), Clemson (41-14), Georgia (39-15) and Florida State (42-15). Seeds Nos. 9 through 16: Oklahoma (37-19), North Carolina State (33-20), Oklahoma State (40-17), Virginia (41-15), Arizona 36-21), UC Santa Barbara (42-12), Oregon State (42-14) and East Carolina (43-15). The last four teams to get at-large bids, in alphabetical order, were Coastal Carolina, Indiana, James Madison and UCF. The first four teams left out were California, Charleston, Cincinnati and TCU. The SEC set a record with 11 teams in regionals and five among the top eight national seeds. The Atlantic Coast Conference has eight teams in the tournament and the Big 12 has six. Selection committee decisions sure to be debated were having East Carolina host a regional over other contenders and Coastal Carolina, Kansas State, Indiana and Florida receiving at-large bids. All six of those schools have representatives on the committee, and all but East Carolina were thought to be on the bubble for bids. Chairman Matt Hogue, the athletic director at Coastal Carolina, said NCAA protocols ensure fairness by requiring committee members to leave the room when their schools are discussed and to not participate if their schools are subject of a vote. “One thing that you do want to have with a committee are folks who are tuned into the sport,” Hogue said, “so just as an inherent natural result, if you have quality people on the committee, it’s going to be likely in many years you’re going to have teams in that situation. So I think that’s important to note.” Other notes about the tournament: — Defending national champion LSU, in danger of missing the tournament six weeks ago after losing 12 of its first 15 SEC games, has won 18 of its past 24 overall and made a run to the conference tournament championship game to earn a No. 2 regional seed at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. — A total of 19 college players projected to be taken in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft, according to MLB.com, are in the tournament. The group is led by Georgia’s Charlie Condon, whose 35 homers and .443 batting average lead the nation. — Vanderbilt has the longest active streak with its 18th straight appearance. Texas is in the tournament for a record 63rd time. Florida State, which had its record-tying streak of regional appearances end at 44 in 2023, is back in the tournament and will be a host for a Division I-record 36th time. — UC Santa Barbara will be an intimidating regional host. The Gauchos have won all 25 of their home games this season, the only Division I team to do so, and have the nation’s longest overall active win streak at 14. — Oral Roberts (27-30-1), which made a surprise run to the CWS last year, won the Summit League Tournament title to make it back to the tournament and are the only team in the field with a losing record. — First-time participants are High Point, Niagara and Northern Kentucky.",

        "content": "Sergio Perez had a huge coming together with the two Haas cars at the 2024 Monaco GP. The crash damaged the RB20 quite badly with only the monocoque surviving due to its sturdity for safety reasons. Now, Helmut Marko has revealed how these damages are going to cause a dent of $2 -3 million in Red Bull’s pockets. According to @formularacers_ on X (formerly Twitter), Formu1a.uno reported the Austrian advisor’s views on the after-effects of Kevin Magnussen and Perez’s massive crash at Beau Rivage. Marko suggested how this crash will also affect their development plans and budget. Usually, $2-3 million is the amount for damages any F1 team suffers overall throughout an entire season. However, Perez’s Monaco GP crash has transcended those standards. While the crash wasn’t his fault as per most, Red Bull will have to bear the brunt of the same come what may. In the budget cap era of F1, where the entire year’s operational budget for each team has an upper limit of $135 million, the Milton Keynes outfit have got a major setback due to this incident. All teams have been looking to bring one or two major upgrade packages due to the cost cap in the past two seasons, rather than bringing new bits to the car every weekend. Meanwhile, Red Bull did not face the need to bring as many upgrades last season. But, 2024 is a different story. The defending champions have to be on top of their development game with rivals like Ferrari and McLaren closing the gap thick and fast. Such a financial blow worth $2 million to their overall budget will have a cascading effect on their in-season upgrades later this season. So, Red Bull have to figure out a way to limit the damage to their on-track advantage. Red Bull have a fight on their hands in 2024 McLaren and Ferrari have unsurprisingly emerged as two major challengers to Red Bull’s dominance. Many had anticipated these two teams to make some good performance gains and they have continued that with their effective upgrades into the season as well. Ferrari has consistently been the second-best team since the start of the 2024 season, hassling Red Bull several times. Meanwhile, McLaren, following on their 2023 precedent made a massive step up in Miami with their major upgrades. Now, these gains are pointing towards Red Bull’s comfortable dominance coming to an end. The talks of a potential championship battle, especially in the constructors’ standings are growing, with Ferrari only 24 points behind the Austrian team. So, from Red Bull’s perspective, every tenth of a second is worth its weight in gold at this moment. They cannot afford to sit easy on the development of the RB20 and need to continue improving on their aggressive design concept.",

He has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open.",

(AP Photo/Jean-Francois Badias) By HOWARD FENDRICH (AP Tennis Writer) PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. “It’s difficult for me to talk,” said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.” While Nadal said it’s doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics’ tennis competition will be held at the French Open’s site. When Monday’s match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal’s uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday’s look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. “The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I’m 28,” Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: “Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: In a significant move, Union Home Minister Amit Shah declared that no family member of terrorists or close relatives of stone pelters will be eligible for government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir. This announcement underscores the Modi government’s firm stance on eradicating terrorism and its ecosystem in the region. In an interview with PTI, Shah detailed the government’s uncompromising strategy. “In Kashmir, we have decided that if someone joins a terrorist organization, their family members will not receive any government job,” he said. Shah extended this policy to stone pelters as well, affirming that their families too will be barred from government employment. Despite challenges from human rights activists who approached the Supreme Court, the government’s stance prevailed. However, Shah mentioned an exception: if a family member comes forward to inform authorities about a relative joining a terror outfit, relief may be provided to that family. Shah highlighted the changes in handling the funerals of terrorists. Previously, large processions were a common occurrence, but now, terrorists are buried with full religious rites in isolated locations to prevent public gatherings. “When a terrorist is surrounded by security forces, he is first given a chance to surrender. We bring in family members like his mother or wife to appeal for his surrender. If he refuses, he faces the consequences,” Shah said. The Home Minister said that there was a substantial decline in terror incidents due to the government’s dual approach of targeting terrorists and dismantling the terror ecosystem. “The National Investigation Agency has taken decisive actions against terror funding, significantly curbing it,” he said. Regarding the Popular Front of India (PFI), Shah confirmed that the government has banned its publications and propaganda under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The PFI, a group founded in Kerala, was banned in September 2022 due to its alleged terror links. Touching upon the case of Amritpal Singh, a pro-Khalistani separatist, Shah revealed, “We have incarcerated him under the NSA (National Security Act).” Singh, the leader of ‘Waris Punjab De’ was arrested in April 2023 and is currently lodged in Dibrugarh jail, Assam. Despite his incarceration, Singh has filed nomination papers to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Punjab’s Khadoor Sahib constituency. Union Home Ministry data highlights the impact of these stringent measures. Terror incidents in Jammu and Kashmir dropped from 228 in 2018 to approximately 50 in 2023. Encounters between security forces and terrorists decreased from 189 in 2018 to around 40 in 2023. Civilian casualties due to terror incidents fell from 55 in 2018 to about five in 2023, and security personnel fatalities reduced from 91 in 2018 to around 15 in 2023. The government’s firm actions have led to a notable decline in terrorism and its support systems in Jammu and Kashmir, marking a significant shift towards lasting peace and security in the region.",

        "content": "President Bola Tinubu is ready to fire underperforming ministers who fail to deliver on targets set for them, the Presidency has said. The Special Adviser on Information and Strategy to the President, Bayo Onanuga, speaking in an exclusive interview with Sunday PRIMANEWS, said though the President was yet to decide on the ministers’ performances, he had told them to deliver on his administration’s eight-point agenda. He added that those found wanting would be asked to leave the cabinet. Onanuga also rated the performance of the administration high as it approaches its first year in office, giving it a score of 70 per cent. He said when President Tinubu took over, Nigeria was using 97 per cent of its revenue to service debt, and was borrowing for recurrent expenditure, which include the payment of salaries, adding that the administration brought the nation back from the brink of economic collapse with the implementation of bold policies, such as the removal of fuel subsidy, and the unification of the exchange rate. Tinubu’s charge to ministers President Bola Tinubu, had while inaugurating his 48 ministers, advisers, and other aides, urged them to put aside their personal interests and focus on his government’s immediate concern of pulling Nigeria out of poverty. The President gave the advice at the close of a three-day retreat for ministers, permanent secretaries, presidential aides, and other top government officials at the State House, Abuja, last year after they were appointed. He told the participants that they had the responsibility of changing the narrative about the country, noting that if they had any problem with Nigeria, they should have a conversation about it. President Tinubu stressed the need for the officials to bond and ensure that the country recovered from ‘elephantiasis’. He said, “We have gathered here to shape the future, no threat about it. The responsibilities we bear are not just titles; they are the hopes and aspirations of millions of Nigerians. “You might be ready to forget about the rest of the world but as a Nigerian, let’s go out there, let’s bond together and make sure our country is fully recovered from elephantiasis. “Let me remind you that you are not here to make excuses; neither am I. I am your friend, brother, father and grandfather. “You must put outside personal ambitions and focus on the progress of our nation. It is through this that we can be truly proud. I am proud to stand before you. I am very proud of all of you. And, I am proud of myself too. I contested the election and won with your support. They took me to court, and I won.” The President also extracted the commitment of the ministers and other government officials to work together as a team to achieve the goals of his government, asking, “We are about to close this three-day cabinet retreat, are we proud that we are Nigerians? Are we sure that we’ve done this? Is the responsibility of the permanent secretary clear in partnership with the minister? Are we one family? “Since we are one family and one nation, and we are in this vehicle together to change the narrative and bring about the economic prosperity of our country. Are we ready?” The President further told his ministers and other aides, “We have a responsibility to our country to make sure we completely change the narrative about Nigeria. “If we have problems, let’s talk to one another. Let’s have gentle conversations about our country. It is not about ‘just leave me alone, I’m going home’; you may not have a home. “There’s nothing you can do successfully without good healthcare and poverty reduction. Like I said before, poverty is not a shameful thing, but it is not acceptable. Are we going to dig our people out of it?” Struggling economy There has, however, been some disquiet around the country as Tinubu counts days to his first anniversary. From rising inflation to insecurity and a shaky exchange rate, the country, according to analysts, still has a long way to go. Although the President inherited a struggling economy, he promised to get it running in no time. Tinubu, in his 80-page policy document, highlighted an eight-point agenda, with national security and economy topping the list. Others include agriculture, power, oil and gas, transportation, and education. In his manifesto, Tinubu said his objective was to foster a new society based on shared prosperity, tolerance, compassion, and the unwavering commitment to treating each citizen with equal respect and due regard. He promised to build a Nigeria, especially for the youth, where sufficient jobs with decent wages create a better life. He said, “Manufacture, create and invent more of the goods and services we require. Nigeria shall be known as a nation of creators, not just of consumers. Export more and import less, strengthening both the naira and our way of life. Continue assisting our ever-toiling farmers, through enlightened agricultural policies that promote productivity and assure decent incomes, so that farmers can support their families and feed the nation. “Modernise and expand public infrastructure so that the rest of the economy can grow at an optimal rate. “Embolden and support our young people and women by harnessing emerging sectors such as the digital economy, entertainment, culture and tourism, and others to build the Nigeria of tomorrow, today. “Train and give economic opportunities to the poorest and most vulnerable among us. We seek a Nigeria where no parent is compelled to send a child to bed hungry, worried whether tomorrow will bring food.” He also vowed that his government would generate, transmit and distribute sufficient, affordable electricity to give people the requisite power to enlighten their lives, homes, and dreams. “Make basic healthcare, education, and housing accessible and affordable for all; and, most importantly, establish a bold and assertive policy that will create a strong yet adaptive national security architecture and action to obliterate terror, kidnapping, banditry, and all other forms of violent extremism from the face of our nation.” On May 29, as he was sworn in, the president removed petrol subsidy, which many economic analysts said was responsible for corruption and waste in the oil sector. This was greeted by outrage, with protests erupting in several locations as a result of the high cost of Premium Motor Spirit, transportation, and food items. Inflation rose astronomically and has continued to do so month-on-month. As of April 2024, the headline inflation rate increased to 33.69 per cent relative to the March 2024 headline inflation rate, which was 33.20 per cent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. In February, the headline inflation rate increased to 31.70 per cent relative to the January 2024 headline inflation rate, which was 29.90 per cent. Meanwhile, the February 2024 headline inflation rate showed an increase of 1.80 per cent (five points), when compared to the January 2024 headline inflation rate. Unemployment also rose to about 4.1 per cent, with over 60 per cent of the youth either unemployed or underemployed. Ministers’ assessment In commemoration of his first anniversary in office, Tinubu directed his ministers to present their performance reports to Nigerians. The Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, while announcing this at a press briefing in Abuja on Wednesday, said the low-key first-anniversary celebration would be marked with sectoral media briefings by the 47 federal ministers. Idris was joined at the press conference by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator George Akume; and the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Abubakar Bagudu. On January 24, 2024, the agency in charge of the assessment, the Central Delivery Coordination Unit, trained at least 140 officials to track and assess the performance of federal ministries, departments and agencies ahead of the assessment. Speaking on Arise TV’s News Night programme in April, the President’s Special Adviser on Policy Coordination, Hadiza Bala-Usman, who also heads the CDCU, affirmed that the unit had received performance reports from at least 20 ministries. She explained that the assessment report would be the joint effort of the ministers, citizens and industry experts. Meanwhile, in April, the Presidency unveiled a citizens’ feedback platform in a bid to get a ‘strong feedback loop between citizens and government’ on the eight priority areas of the current administration. Bala-Usman, who disclosed this at the Go-Live event of the CDT held in Abuja that month, said the creation of the application was informed by President Tinubu’s decision to assess his ministers and heads of agencies based on key performance indicators. Bala-Usman added that the eight priority areas for the assessment of the ministers’ performances in the App included reforming the economy to deliver sustained inclusive growth, strengthening national security for peace and prosperity, boosting agriculture to achieve food security, and unlocking energy and natural resources for sustainable development. Others are to enhance infrastructure and transportation as enablers of growth; focus on education, health, and social investment as essential pillars of development; accelerate diversification through industrialisation, digitisation, creative arts, manufacturing and innovation; and improve governance for effective service delivery. Also, in an interview in October 2023, Bala-Usman provided extensive details about the application and its expected deliverables. She had said, “We are going to deploy an application— a software— where citizens can report back on project-based deliverables that the Federal Government has committed to doing within the period to 2024.” Detailing the process at the time, she said, “We sat with the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. We have worked effectively to define the exact deliverables for each ministry. “Those deliverables cascade to the agencies of government. So, for example, you have deliverables for the health sector, and everything that is contained within the value chain or the ecosystem within that sector will be contained within the deliverables. “Those deliverables are translated into key performance indicators for the respective ministries. Once you have your key performance indicators, you’re able to clearly understand what your deliverables are over the period of the four years of the administration.” However, an analysis of the feedback reports from the application made available to Sunday PRIMANEWS showed that some Nigerians rated the Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu; Minister of Defence, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar; Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman; and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammad Abubakar, very poorly, giving each of them one mark out of a possible five. However, Onanuga insisted that the President had done well given what he met on the ground. While promising that the administration would deliver more on its promises in the next 12 months, the president’s Special Adviser on Information and Strategy said Tinubu would sack ministers who failed to perform and meet the targets set for them. He said, “President Tinubu has already told them (the ministers) they will go if they can’t perform. He told them at the retreat last year that the government has an eight-point agenda, and he expects the ministers to deliver on it. Those who are found wanting would have to go. But, as of today, the President has not made any decision on that.” Onanuga also stated that while the President had not announced that he would reshuffle his cabinet, he wanted them to be accountable, adding that that was why he asked them to present their scorecards, even though they had only spent eight months in office. “The president has not said he is going to reshuffle. Let me explain something. None of those ministers have spent one year in office. They came in last August. The president wants them to be accountable. That’s why he told them to come out and give their scorecards, to talk about what they have done in the last eight months. When you see what they have done, you cannot but give this government, in its first year, a 7/10 for the various achievements that his ministers and, by extension, his government have achieved.” Tinubu performance abysmal – PDP However, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party does not see anything good to cheer about the one year in office of President Tinubu. Faulting claims by the All Progressives Congress that President Tinubu had done very well and that Nigerians would rate him highly, the Acting National Chairman of the PDP, Umar Damagum, described the first year stewardship of the president as ‘an abysmal failure’. Tinubu has not done well – LP Also reacting, the Deputy President of the Labour Party, Ayo Olorunfemi, said the presidency was only deceiving Nigerians to think that President Bola Tinubu had done well in his first year in office. He criticised the president and the APC, saying Tinubu’s administration had only taken citizens from ‘frying pan to fire’. He said, “They have done well to themselves as a nuclear family. They are nuclear families. Nigeria is roasting in poverty, people can no longer feed, hopelessness has taken over the land, and anarchy is taking over. So, what is it that he has done? What is it that this government and its political party have done in the past nine years? “They took us from frying pan to fire. That is exactly what they have done in the past nine years. I don’t think they have done anything good. They are just deceiving us, believing that Nigerians are fools.” ‘Govt performing poorly’ In his reaction, a public affairs analyst, Dr Emma Jimo, in an interview with Sunday PRIMANEWS, highlighted the government’s failure to address basic needs despite promises of renewed hope. He said, “Pick education, for example. The government is performing poorly. Maybe the highest point is the government taking responsibility to pay the backlogs of the previous government’s indebtedness to ASUU. Even at that, it is still poor. Aside from that, look at what binds all Nigerians together – the economy. “This government is performing poorly on the standard of living. The cost of living has gone up astronomically. The measures put in place to run the economy have not been working. They failed woefully, and they are still failing.” In a similar vein, another analyst, Dr Anthony Ahmedu, told Sunday PRIMANEWS that the current administration had disappointed Nigerians with its performance in one year, adding that it had continuously made poor decisions that were rejected by the citizens. The academic said, “I had believed the Tinubu-led government would be able to take Nigeria to a greater height from the mess the previous administrations left us, looking at his (Tinubu’s) experience in politics, and especially his role in Lagos State. But to my utmost disappointment, the current administration has not met expectations at all. “Economy wise, especially, because I felt he was coming in with the economic idea of Lagos, and should be able to help the economy of Nigeria. But, he has not been able to do so in any way. We can see how unstable the naira has been. We have also seen some wrong decisions taken, such as naira devaluation and subsidy removal.” Additional reports: Godfrey George, Ayoola Olasupo, Dirisu Yakubu and Babatunde Titilola",

Atlante stations will be recognizable thanks to the iconic canopy designed by Bertone Design and will integrate various technological solutions, including: a system for detecting unauthorized parking of internal combustion engine vehicles, intelligent lighting and signage, and Wi-Fi connection. There will also be digital information totems and a 24-hour video surveillance system. “Our mission is to contribute to achieving zero-emission mobility in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. This award represents a further step after the 87 fast and ultra-fast charging points on the French highways for VINCI Autoroutes and consolidates Atlante’s position as main independent operator in Southern Europe in the development and management of fast and ultra-fast charging networks on highway infrastructures,” commented Stefano Terranova, CEO of Atlante. “Increasing charging stations on Italian highways is a concrete response to concerns about the compatibility of electric vehicles with long-distance travel. Making charging simple and ultra-fast even on highways simplifies the transition to electric mobility, thus contributing to a more sustainable future. These new ultra-fast stations increase Atlante’s presence in strategic Italian infrastructures, from major airports to ring roads and major highways, allowing Atlante customers to recharge throughout the national territory without further worries,” stated Gabriele Tuccillo, CEO of Atlante Italia. Atlante’s charging stations will be accessible 24/7, even to people with reduced mobility, equipped with POS terminals for payment with bank cards, usable by all electric vehicles, and compatible with every charging standard and electric mobility service provider.

So it is for the Guards who open a three-game series against the Rockies on Monday afternoon at Coors Field. They are on one of those rolls where everything is going right, even when it doesn’t look so good. History is involved as well. The Guardians are one of four Cleveland teams to win 36 of their first 53 games. The other three all went to the World Series in 1995, 1954 and 1920. It’s something to think about and enjoy.

        "description": "THE LibDems can take the key third party position at Westminster from the SNP at the General Election, its leader has said ...",
        "content": "Ed Davey made clear his intention to win back the third status in the Commons during a visit to Scotland on Monday. The LibDems have not been Westminster’s third party – which guarantees a spot at Prime Minister’s Questions – since the SNP’s landslide in 2015, and in Holyrood they lost their party status after returning only four MSPs in the 2021 elections. However, speaking in Scotland on Monday, Davey said there could be “more liberals than nationalists” in the new UK parliament. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, Davey pointed to four seats north of the Border his party were targeting – all of which are currently held by SNP MPs. These include Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire – a portion of which was held by former party leader Charles Kennedy before he lost it to the retiring former SNP Westminster boss Ian Blackford – and Mid Dunbartonshire, the successor to the seat lost by former LibDem chief Jo Swinson to the SNP’s Amy Callaghan in 2019. “We are a big part of the change that’s happening,” Davey said. “I think there is a massive desire to get rid of the Conservatives in Westminster and also, actually, to get rid of the SNP. “I think we have a real chance, when we get to July 5 – the day after polling day – there will be more liberals than nationalists in the next parliament. “I think the Liberal Democrats can be the third party in UK politics again.” READ MORE: 'Beggars belief': Keir Starmer calls himself a 'progressive socialist' Seats won by the party, he said, would have “fantastic local champions”, who would “make such a difference” at Westminster and could lead to an increase to funding for the health service. The comments came as the party launched its Scottish General Election campaign, with Davey joining Scottish group leader Alex Cole-Hamilton. The launch focused on the provision of NHS dentistry – a devolved matter – with the pair set to claim the service has been neglected by the Scottish and UK governments. Speaking ahead of the event, Cole-Hamilton said: “People are resorting to DIY dentistry and buying tools off Amazon to do the job themselves because they can’t get an NHS dentist.\" The Scottish LibDems have been under fire after The National revealed that their candidate in a key target seat previously donated £25,000 to Boris Johnson's Tory Party . Dr Lucy Beattie, the SNP’s candidate for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said: “Voters in constituencies such as Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross haven’t forgotten that the LibDems worked along with the Tories to impose huge austerity cuts and cut household incomes. “We need to get rid of the Tory Government. “The way to do that in Scotland is to vote SNP, because we are the main challengers in every Tory-held seat. “Voters can only rely on the SNP to put the interests of Scotland first.”",

        "content": "The Federal Government has said that the Nigeria Air remains suspended. The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, confirmed the suspension while speaking during the ministerial press briefing in Abuja, marking President Bola Tinubu’s first year in office. Mr Keyamo said: “It remains suspended. It was never Air Nigeria. It was not Air Nigeria. That’s the truth. It was only painted Nigeria Air. It was Ethiopian Airlines trying to flag our flag. “If it is so, why not allow our local plane to fly our flag? So nobody should dispute that it was Nigeria Air. “Air Nigeria must be indigenous, must be wholly Nigerian, and must be for the full benefits of Nigeria, not that 50 per cent of the profit is for another country.” Mr Keyamo reiterated that the ownership structure of the suspended airline is not beneficial to the country. Nigeria Air must be indigenous, it must be only Nigeria or it must be for the full benefit of Nigeria. “Not that 60 per cent of the profit is for another country. How does that benefit us? So It remains suspended,” he said. In 2023, the Ministry of Aviation, under Hadi Sirika, former minister, had unveiled Nigeria Air three days before the end of former President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. The development had elicited concerns among stakeholders nationwide over the ownership arrangement which gave Ethiopian Airlines a 49 per cent equity stake.

        "content": "Police patrols have continued to crack down on public order offences in an Isle of Wight town this bank holiday weekend. South Wight Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) arrested a 42-year-old man from Sandown on suspicion of Public Order Act offences on the High Street. The man was later released, reported for summons and dispersed from Sandown for 48 hours. On the seafront, officers found a large group of people causing ‘a significant disturbance and drinking alcohol to excess'. The behaviour was taking place in an area protected by a Public Space Protection Order, granting police the power to seize and destroy. Officers seized and destroyed the alcohol and used dispersal powers to move the group away from the area for 48 hours. Elsewhere in Sandown, police responded to a report of a female committing public order offences this morning (Monday, May 27). Officers detained a suspect nearby, and they have since been released under investigation. An address in Sandown, linked to significant crime and disorder in the last three months, has been handed an ASB Closure Warning Notice. If the warning notice is not adhered to, South Wight NPT will apply to the courts to forcibly close the address for up to three months. The Neighbourhoods team has also completed several stop searches under the Misuse of Drugs Act in various locations throughout the Bay.

        "content": "Lewis Steele reported [27 May] that Sean Dyche is “exploring” a deal to sign Harrison this summer after featuring regularly when fit in the 2023-24 season. This deal has been made easier as Leeds missed out on promotion to the Premier League at Wembley against Southampton. The Toffees are said to already be exploring getting a deal over the line. Leeds’ 1-0 defeat now means they will look to sell players this summer, which has given the Toffees confidence in signing Harrison. Harrison was a useful asset to Dyche’s squad as Everton secured yet another season of Premier League football with time to spare. The winger has got plenty of experience now in the top division which certainly makes him a positive addition to the side. With himself and Dwight McNeil firing on all cylinders with Dominic Calvert-Lewin through the middle, the Toffees have a solid front line. The 27-year-old will likely come for quite a large fee given the financial situation at Goodison Park, but he could be worth bringing in. In the Premier League last season, he scored three and assisted three but only featured from the start across 25 games [ ]. If he can maintain fitness over the course of the whole campaign, he could prove to be one of Everton’s more important players next season. The positivity behind this move depends on the fee that the Toffees pay to Leeds given the financial struggles they are likely to endure this summer. In other Everton news,",

        "content": "The project, situated next to the Dunes Mall, will consist of 424 single story two-bedroom townhouses. According to the Namibia IHS country manager Henk Snyman, the townhouses will impact people’s lives in terms of space delivery, job creation and social impacts. “The title development of this project is about N$200 million. We are hoping to put the first units on the market at roughly N$600 000 per unit. We are trying to keep affordability as low as possible. From there, [there] will be some escalation as we move on. The project will typically take three to five years to complete, depending on how quickly sales go. It took us six months to flatten the ground,” he said. The IHS Fund II Sub-Saharan Africa raised US$83,9 million from five investors and IHS as the fund manager. Project investors include: the European Investment Bank, Government Institutions Pensions Fund, KFW Development Bank, International Finance Corporation and the Women’s Development Bank. The company has already constructed over 1 700 housing units around Namibia. The total investment by the fund into the Dunes Estate project is N$117,3 million. The company was started in South Africa two decades ago and expanded to Namibia and Botswana, and more recently Kenya. The first completed units are expected by the first quarter of 2025.",

        "content": "The United Nations peacekeeping chief argued against the latest calls for international troops to deploy in Gaza, saying the post-war state of affairs was too uncertain and that any operation would require agreement from Israel, which has been highly critical of the U.N.’s work in Palestinian territories. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview that he’s aware of demands for sending in so-called Blue Helmets, including earlier this month by the Arab League, but cautioned it’s too early and the politics too fraught to consider the option at the moment. “Nobody really knows what the day after in Gaza would look like,” Lacroix said. “We absolutely don’t know what the state of affairs would look like but obviously the parties — and that would certainly include Israel — would have to agree to such a proposition.” Right now, the U.N. is calling “first and foremost” for a humanitarian cease-fire, releasing of hostages, access to aid — and then progress toward a two-state political solution, Lacroix said. He added that deployment was a decision that must be taken up by the 15-member Security Council. The U.N. and its operations in Gaza have come under intense scrutiny by Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack, in which some 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage. Hamas still holds scores of hostages. Israel has accused the U.N.’s main humanitarian organization in Gaza of being infiltrated by Hamas operatives — which the agency denies — and at the U.N. has dismissed criticism of its bombardment of the territory. The Arab League proposal came in the final statement of its meeting in Bahrain May 16. “We call for the deployment of United Nations international protection and peacekeeping forces in the occupied Palestinian territory until the two-state solution is implemented,” the group’s 22 members said in the Bahrain Declaration. Lacroix also addressed the challenges the war in the Gaza Strip has created for 10,500 UN peacekeepers stationed in southern Lebanon. He said the Israel-Hamas war was having a “major impact” on the mission known as Unifil, which he described as a mediator between Israeli and Lebanese forces. More broadly, Lacroix, a veteran French diplomat, said political gridlock was the biggest impediment to U.N.-led operations, beyond just peace and security. “That is really probably the biggest challenge to not only peacekeeping operations, but frankly to anything that the U.N. can do on peace and security,” Lacroix said. “We need to have member states showing unity and commitment to multilateral approaches to crisis.” He didn’t mention any countries by name but the council’s work has been largely frozen by disputes between the U.S. and Russia, two of its five permanent members.",

Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest Scottish crime and courts news sent straight to your inbox with our daily Criminal Record newsletter We have more newsletters Hundreds of 'illegal' vapes have been seized after cops raided a shop in a Scots town . In a joint sting operation on May 27 with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, cops visited several shops stocking the electric cigarette-style devices. They found one store in Irvine selling unregulated counterfeits. Around 220 devices were confiscated from the location and it is unknown if cops or the trading standards authority took any further action. Police across the country have been cracking down on the sale of illegal devices that are often targeted at young people and teens. Last week the Record reported how police and trading standards seized hundreds of illegal supersized vapes in North Lanarkshire. Following today's operation, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said: \"In a continued intelligence-led partnership with North Ayrshire Trading Standards, police today attended several vape stockists in North Ayrshire. \"Vapes are regulated in the UK, and there is specific guidance which must be met. These include maximum nicotine strength, maximum liquid capacity, compliant packaging and health warnings. \"Within one Irvine store alone today, 220 counterfeit vapes were found and seized.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

        "content": "Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa met European Council President Charles Michel on Sunday in Brussels as part of a visit to the heart of EU institutions. Earlier Sunday, Mustafa met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide who officially gave him recognition of the State of Palestine papers. Mr Mustafa was in Brussels to meet with international partners including EU Foreign Policy chief Josep Borrell and Norway’s Foreign minister who handed over the official papers for recognition. He says the Palestinian Authority is preparing to be the government of the future state of Palestine – including Gaza. \"The first priority is to support our people in Gaza. They need every support we can. And I think the best support we can all do for them is to speed up the ceasefire. Every day represents a major loss of human lives and properties and hope for our people,” said Mohammad Mustafa, the Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. He also met with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and EU High Representative, Josep Borrell. Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares says his country won’t be intimidated by Israel’s response to recognition of Palestine after Israel announced it would no longer allow Spanish NGO’s work in the West Bank. \"Our goal is to recognize the State of Palestine tomorrow and make every possible effort to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible, and ultimately, to reach that definitive peace. That is what is currently focusing our attention, what is important, and what has centered our conversation in the previous meeting and the attack mentioned, I believe that what it does is underline what the International Court of Justice has indicated,\" said José Manuel Albares Bueno, the Spanish Foreign Minister. Norway, Spain and Ireland last week agreed to recognize a Palestinian state in a move welcomed by Palestinians as an affirmation of their decades-long quest. Israel recalled its ambassadors to the three countries in protest. Several European Union countries argue a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. Additional sources • AP",

        "content": "Dividend stocks attract many investors due to their steady cash flow. Corporations with strong balance sheets tend to give out quarterly dividends and hike their payouts every year. This combination makes it feasible for investors to retire on dividend income and cash from other sources, such as Social Security. Some dividend stocks are well positioned to deliver meaningful dividend growth in the upcoming years. Investors may want to keep these rock-solid dividend stocks on their radars. Broadcom (AVGO) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO ) is a leading semiconductor company that is capitalizing on the AI boom. While the company’s chips generate plenty of demand, its recent acquisition of VMware continues to fuel its earnings. Revenue increased by 34% year-over-year in Q1 2024 as the company reached $11.96 billion. Broadcom anticipates generating more than $50 billion in fiscal 2024. Wall Street analysts have quickly assigned higher price targets for the “Strong Buy” stock. The stock has 21 “Buy” ratings and three “Hold” ratings. The average price target suggests a 12% gain is coming. Broadcom currently offers a 1.49% yield, which is good for a stock up by 459% over the past five years. A 30% year-to-date gain suggests momentum is still building for this long-term winner. Over the past five years, an annualized dividend growth rate of 17.49% cements the company as a top dividend stock. American Express (AXP) American Express (NYSE: AXP ) has been in business since 1850 and has become a leading fintech firm in the credit and debit card industry. Millions of people use American Express cards for purchases, and the company makes a small percentage of each transaction. As long as consumers continue to spend, American Express stands to benefit. The formula worked well for the company in Q1 2024 . During that quarter, revenue increased by 11% year-over-year while net income rallied by 34% year-over-year. American Express has been producing several solid quarters. Those successes have resulted in shares more than doubling over the past five years. The stock is currently up by 26% year-to-date and has a 20 P/E ratio. Furthermore, investors can get shares while they offer a 1.18% yield. American Express has had an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.51% over the past decade. The firm only has a 20.31% payout ratio, indicating plenty of room for dividend growth. Main Street Capital (MAIN) Main Street Capital (NYSE: MAIN ) doesn’t have a high annualized dividend growth rate. The company recently hiked its annual dividend 2.1% year-over-year. While that’s not impressive, the business development company currently offers a 5.93% yield. Unlike most dividend stocks, Main Street Capital also issues monthly dividend payouts instead of quarterly payouts. The stock typically stays flat but has an exceptional year. Main Street Capital has gained 22% over the past year as its diversified portfolio of lower middle market companies continues to generate returns. Total investment income increased by 9% year-over-year in Q1 2024 . The firm has 191 cumulative investments and $7.4 billion in capital under management. The management team has a cumulative 100 years of experience and prioritizes companies with revenue between $10 million and $150 million and EBITDA between $3 million and $20 million. Main Street Capital is diversified across several industries with a strong focus on internet software and services, machinery and professional services. Walmart (WMT) Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) has become a top destination for people who want affordable prices for a wide range of goods. It is the largest grocer and continues to see high demand for its inventory. Revenue increased by 6.0% year-over-year in Q1 FY25 as the company saw more demand for its e-commerce and advertising segments. Both of those components exhibited year-over-year growth rates above 20%. The stock is up 23% year-to-date and has soared by 93% over the past five years. Walmart trades at a 34 P/E ratio and offers a 1.27% yield. Dividend growth has been slow, but a recent 9% dividend hike offers long-term optimism. Walmart has raised its dividend for 51 consecutive years. Revenue and dividends weren’t the only things going up for Walmart. The retailer also reported a 22.4% year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS. Walmart has $9.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, even after a $1.1 billion stock buyback during the quarter. Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has exposure to numerous verticals and looks like it will continue to outperform the stock market. The tech conglomerate is currently the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation. It has a $3.20 trillion market cap and is up by 16% year-to-date. Its 5-year gain comes to 248%. Microsoft trades at a 37 P/E ratio with a 0.70% yield. While the dividend is low, most investors won’t mind due to the high long-term returns. However, the dividend can become a notable component soon enough. Microsoft has been raising its dividend considerably over the years. The annualized dividend growth rate has stood at 10.60% over the past decade. The tech giant only has a 24.66% dividend payout ratio, so Microsoft likely maintains a double-digit growth rate for many years. However, Wall Street analysts aren’t waiting for the yield to increase. Based on the average price target, the stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 14% upside. Costco (COST) Costco (NASDAQ: COST ) has a 32.50% dividend payout ratio and has an annualized dividend growth rate of 12.65% over the past decade. These metrics make the 0.57% yield look more promising, but the occasional special dividend payout leads to significant value for patient investors. Costco closed out 2023 with a special $15 dividend , a big jump from the quarterly payout of $1.16 per share. The low yield shouldn’t discourage investors, thanks to the special dividend.
